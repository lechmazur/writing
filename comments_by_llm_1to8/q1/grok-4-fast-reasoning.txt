    Elara's transformation from dramatic sensationalist to humble observer is earned through concrete experience with butterfly dust patterns, though internal conflict could be more embodied in peak moments. Her motivation crystallizes through specific micro-choices (collecting dust, mapping patterns, releasing butterflies) with visible cost (lost career, flooded home).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's transformation from artist to fugitive reads clearly through embodied fear (trembling hands, breathless flight) and her adaptive response to threat. However, her internal processing remains somewhat abstract ("purpose in the pauses") without sufficient contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us she's "steadily adaptive" rather than showing this trait creating specific friction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's trauma-to-purpose arc earns its transformation through concrete details (frostbite scars, tuning fork case against ribs), though some emotional beats lean toward therapy-speak ("translate silence into music"). The heat-map sequence effectively embodies internal states, and Lira's wordless empathy creates genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's weariness and undertaker identity effectively motivate his pursuit of permanent rest, with his stubbornness emerging naturally through action rather than declaration. The transformation from seeking solitude to actively guiding souls shows genuine character movement with visible cost—his splitting across impossible spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's "gently persistent" characterization manifests concretely through her soft steps, murmured warnings, and decisive bell-ringing that crystallizes community resolve. The intergenerational dynamic between elders and youth creates genuine tension around risk and legacy. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "binding elders' wisdom to the youth's fire" rather than embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's spiritual curiosity and quest for "unused love" drives consistent choices, with the healing sequence showing embodied emotion through breathing synchronization. However, the brother's appearance feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality, and some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("foggy lucidity," "pilgrim of sparks") without sufficient concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to trace time's texture through maze design is clear and rooted in his mother's fading photographs, with embodied reactions to the halo fragment and genuine internal conflict about imposing order versus surrendering to reverie. The retrocognitive trap forces meaningful action (disintegrating the fragment), though the resolution relies heavily on mystical incantations rather than character-specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his dissident past, with the chains serving as embodied contradiction between his role as liberator and his physical bondage. The final choice to plant seeds is well-earned through prior causality. However, the enforcers appear somewhat mechanically as obstacles, and emotional embodiment could be more specific during peak stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to find "the sound of trust breaking" drives concrete actions throughout, with her synesthetic perception adding specificity. The betrayal by Marcus provides clear emotional grounding, though some interiority veers toward diagnostic ("memories' impact wasn't destruction, but a forge for resilience"). Her scarred hands and technical expertise feel earned through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions throughout, though her internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The transformation from thief to guardian feels somewhat unearned—the shift happens through external revelation rather than internal struggle with visible cost. Her "quietly savvy" trait manifests in concrete actions (feigning interest, decoding flowers) but the emotional progression jumps too quickly to tears and acceptance without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (the bookmark discovery, his lost apprentices), and his dramatic narration reveals character under solitude's pressure. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradiction—his "thawing heart" progression feels linear rather than torn between competing impulses at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation (proving vulnerability as power) drives consistent choices through phobic challenges and betrayal discovery. The internal conflict between fear and determination manifests concretely in her navigation of the claustrophobic shelves and acrophobic balcony. However, Marcus reads more as plot device than character, and some emotional beats rely on declarative statements ("trembling certainty blooming into resolve") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's obsession with mapping the endless night drives consistent action, though her internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied. The choice to "summarize silence" shows agency but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization. Her final smile when the star winks out suggests earned satisfaction, but the cost of her pursuit remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to find "where thoughts come from" drives genuine internal exploration through the violin discovery and timeline loops. Her "remarkable composure" manifests consistently through embodied actions like "delicate clamps" lifting the ice violin. The amalgamation of fragmented timelines creates layered characterization, though some abstract philosophizing ("thoughts weren't born in silicon or synapse, but in the spaces between moments") lacks embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's transformation from guarded observer to vulnerable participant is earned through concrete micro-choices—pocketing the lens, stepping forward, drawing his own doodle. The internal contradiction between his registrar's neutrality and his deep motivation to connect plays out through embodied moments, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("mistrust born from unspoken wounds").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's motivation to prove gardens respond to faithful hands rather than measured luck is clear and drives his ritual polishing. His internal consistency holds through the marble-polishing ceremonies that commemorate victories. However, the transformation at closure—from skepticism to validation—feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives the scene, but character development relies heavily on conceptual explanation rather than embodied emotion. The "mechanically warm" voice modulator provides texture to Jax but both characters lack internal contradiction or meaningful struggle under pressure. The final choice to engage the lever lacks visible personal cost despite the technical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through trembling fingers, physical descent into flooded space, and the careful handling of the waterlogged program. His internal drive intensifies credibly from musical inspiration to ghostly communion. The final choice to play violin despite knowing it will dissolve the program shows genuine cost, though his emotional response to Isabella's revealed truth ("inspired no longer by mystery but by resolution") feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal journey from isolation to considering descent shows consistent motivation, and Mira functions as an effective catalyst with her fault-tolerant oracle nature. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—Elara's shift from years of chosen isolation to readiness to leave happens too quickly without sufficient internal resistance or cost being dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's reckless exploration motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like gripping the flashlight and pocketing the valve. The parallel guilt structure between Elias and the ghost creates meaningful internal conflict. However, the ghost figure's sudden appearance and immediate confession lacks the gradual causality needed for higher scores - this pivotal revelation arrives too conveniently without earned buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" manifests consistently through concrete observations of decay and transformation. His final choice to burrow deeper "into the essence of change itself" shows earned evolution, though internal contradiction could be more embodied rather than stated ("trembling not from age but from the regenerative silence").

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to nurture wonder through shared grief is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in gifting the curl. The emotional progression from guardedness to "dawning wonder" in Theo feels earned through concrete musical exchange. Interiority relies on some abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "cautious exuberance") but embodied moments like crushing sage leaves and synced breathing during eclipse ground the emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen's motivation to collect stories from walls is consistently rendered through concrete actions like pressing her ear to plaster and tracing mortar lines. Her discovery of the medieval scholar's parallel quest creates a resonant mirroring that deepens her purpose. The character lacks internal contradiction or compelling flaws that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to "transpose his life into a new key" drives concrete actions through the microdot fortunes, though his internal contradictions remain mostly sequential rather than simultaneous. The accidentally prophetic nature creates genuine tension when Maris's dream echoes his unwritten fortune, but key emotional beats rely on abstract statements ("shifting from monotonous rhythm to symphony") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Father Elias has clear motivation and his loop-pedal method creates genuine pressure, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than embodied emotion. The character's transformation from musician to sentinel provides backstory coherence, yet peak moments lack the contradictory impulses that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's chronological homesickness and desire to conduct "unheard symphonies" create clear internal tension. The memory-mapping onto the nautilus shell shows concrete embodied action under pressure. However, the resolution feels more declared than dramatized—"He had become the conductor" arrives without a decisive cost or trade-off being shown.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" drives consistent choices, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her doubts are told as "serpents" rather than shown through competing impulses. The gravity-defying ability functions well as externalized agency. Character change occurs but relies on abstract resolution ("timelines fusing") rather than a concrete choice with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's emotional numbness and quest for feeling through vibration is well-embodied through concrete actions like tracing drum hides and repairing the phonograph. The final breakthrough with tears feels earned through accumulated sensory pressure. However, the transformation from numbness to "quiet fire" happens somewhat quickly in the final beats without showing intermediate emotional stages.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's meticulous nature drives his discovery and response to the pigeon's message, with his "credibly curious" trait enabling lateral thinking rather than direct confrontation. Internal conflict between caution and curiosity plays out concretely through his measured courtyard movements. The choice to encode findings in "storm metaphors" demonstrates earned agency, though the emotional cost of this decision could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation coheres beautifully through his aromatically cautious nature and suppressed grief over his wife's death by rogue fragrance. The final choice to grieve openly without restraint represents earned catharsis, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("gnawing motivation to understand why some smells triggered tears"). Internal contradiction plays effectively as he battles professional caution against personal need.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation as a wandering poet seeking to capture the ineffable is clear, and his internal conflict between freedom and binding himself emerges in the grotto scene. However, the character relies heavily on abstract poet-philosopher musings rather than embodied emotional states, and the "ethically playful grin" feels like a label rather than earned characterization. The final non-choice (letting the rope fall) avoids the cost that would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to "find beauty in the unfinished" drives consistent action through the storytelling ritual, with his acoustic perception creating specific embodied moments like hearing "unspoken yearnings" in breath shifts. The final choice to pass the bowl and enable others' stories shows agency with visible communal cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around trauma ("charred memories") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from detached observer to empathetic practitioner is earned through accumulated sensory detail and the static electricity motif, with her final laugh and "unfeigned" emotion marking genuine change. The internal contradiction between knowing and feeling drives meaningful choices, particularly in how she processes clients' pain through her developing empathy. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("willing the scent to penetrate") and occasional tell-heavy passages about her emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters are well-motivated with clear traits (shrewd broker, silent archivist), and their connection feels earned through shared values of quiet generosity. However, internal conflict is told rather than dramatized ("cautious exuberance" is labeled repeatedly), and the transformation feels too smooth without genuine struggle or meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation to integrate drives consistent choices through her bold sympathy, though her interiority relies on abstract labels ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final integration feels earned through accumulated gestures, but peak emotional moments lack the visceral specificity that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her illustrator's eye consistently filters perception, creating a coherent POV. The final choice to accept being bound by borrowed time shows genuine cost. However, the giant as a character lacks embodied presence beyond functional time-manipulation, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("Triumph surged").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation to "quantify heartache" through magical mathematics is character-specific and drives concrete action, though the emotional progression relies on abstract concepts rather than embodied contradiction. The ambiguous loss backstory provides consistent motivation, but internal conflict manifests more as melancholy persistence than active contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to become visible drives concrete actions through the cache ritual and final emergence, with internal contradictions between his hermit nature and desire for connection playing out through embodied choices. The closure moment where he kneels beside the woman shows earned transformation with visible cost (abandoning his hidden life). Diagnostic label-speak appears briefly ("motivation crystallized") but doesn't contaminate peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her scientific obsession with plant behavior drives the metamorphosis choice. The transformation decision feels earned through established character traits, though the internal conflict could be more visceral. Her "circuitously sincere" approach to truth manifests believably in dialogue and action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias shows clear motivation through insomnia driving his rain-following choice, with embodied exhaustion ("haggard awe," "trembling fingers"). The exchange with Mira forces a value hierarchy choice (brooch for water/stories), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the decision moment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation burns clear and her transformation from confident seer to possessed vessel shows genuine change with visible cost. The shadows' invasion creating internal contradiction works well, though some moments drift toward abstract ("steadily unpredictable" reads more like a label than embodied trait). The final possession lands with felt consequence as she loses agency while gaining amplified power.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to compile fragments into meaning is clear and consistent, driving concrete micro-choices like gathering the valve and organizing the archive visits. The final act of heartening the folk through the trumpet's resonant hum shows earned agency with visible community impact. However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("reactively visionary" trait functions more as description than contradiction), and the emotional progression from isolation to community connection lacks embodied specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation drives genuine stakes through the family mystery, with her "trembling certainty" embodying authentic internal conflict. The character makes concrete choices (following the cracks, using the punch) that carry visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("analytically artistic" reads as label-speak) and the emotional arc resolving too cleanly without lingering contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's sympathetic skepticism manifests through concrete actions—clearing space, transcribing despite doubts—with her "courageously kind" nature driving choices under pressure. The entangled memories create genuine internal conflict as her own buried recollection surfaces. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("sculpt space for reflection") and the too-tidy emotional resolution that doesn't fully earn its cathartic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's immortal ennui and dimensional awareness create clear motivation for seeking "what happens after goodbye," with the curse-driven vision sequence embodying internal conflict. However, the resolution lacks embodied cost—she remains "immortal still" with only abstract "void within her had cracked," missing the concrete price this rubric demands for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation is concrete and rooted in her relationship with Marco, driving her to breach the drawer and decode his final message. The internal conflict between honoring/questioning her father manifests through specific actions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("the honest one") and occasional emotional summary rather than full embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias remains largely static despite the dramatic premise of fleeing a plague-stricken town. His motivation to "collect the textures of different times" lacks embodied struggle or internal contradiction, reading more as an abstract artistic pursuit than urgent human need. The character functions more as a vessel for lyrical description than a person facing genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wanderer's motivation to discover "the texture of memories" drives concrete micro-choices throughout—crouching behind containers, climbing precarious perches, clutching the poison label. Their internal state shifts from anonymous survivor to active collector, with the final image showing them as "survivor of ink's mistakes" accepting their nameless existence through borrowed histories.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's skepticism-to-revelation arc is earned through concrete sensory triggers (shell's warmth, cello's resonant hums) that compel micro-choices under pressure. The reimagined conversations with father and Mira embody contradictory impulses—dismissal wrestling with regret—that crystallize in his final acceptance of the "ephemeral compass." Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("gloomy cheer washed over him") rather than purely embodied response.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's "culture shock absorber" role manifests through concrete actions—encoding messages, organizing resistance, absorbing the juggler's turmoil—with her dual allegiance creating genuine internal tension. The foundation chip grounds her motivation physically. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("orderly intuitive nature") and the final collective decision slightly diffusing individual agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's purposeful curiosity drives consistent choices under pressure, from seeking the crater's edge to preserving the sand grain. Her melancholy about the space age's encroachment creates genuine internal tension. The character arc from inspector to preserver of the precious works, though her emotional progression could deepen beyond wistful observation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's blindness creates authentic constraints that shape his repair methods, and his devotion manifests through concrete sensory navigation. The motivation to "decode feedback into direction" drives tangible choices, though the emotional arc would benefit from more internal contradiction during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his dry wit provides character texture ("Rivers don't start wars; cartographers do"), but internal contradiction is limited to brief doubt flickers rather than sustained competing impulses acting in scene. The quest motivation drives consistent action, though the final choice to venture forth lacks a dramatized cost beyond leaving the outpost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear but her characterization relies heavily on archetypal "ancient guardian" traits without specific embodied emotion. The cryptic riddles feel ornamental rather than revealing character under pressure. Some embodied details like "hands, callused yet gentle" work, but interiority remains abstract ("her motivation burned deep") rather than contradictory or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" manifests through concrete embodied actions—her deliberate uncorking of the vial despite danger, her practiced patience untangling kelp while oxygen dwindles. The childhood memory of untangling nets provides earned causality for her survival method. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "ephemeral" and "lonesome splendor" that occasionally drifts toward philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to rewrite his father's legacy is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like pressing his palm to the scuffs and kneeling at the confessional. The internal conflict between being his father's echo and finding his own voice drives meaningful choices. However, some interiority relies on abstraction ("sustaining impossibilities") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's progression from dismissal to acceptance is earned through accumulating visions, though his internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene. The ghost bride functions more as catalyst than full character. The final choice carries visible cost (his physical dissolution) but the "mournful elation" emotional complexity feels somewhat performed rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation reads clearly through her actions of weaving luminous paths, though her internal conflict remains abstract ("hauntingly optimistic" lacks embodied contradiction). The transformation from isolation to community connection earns its cost through the ritualistic sewing, but interiority relies on poetic assertion rather than concrete thought.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore faith drives consistent action, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("heart a mix of longing and trepidation") rather than embodied contradiction. The final restoration of faith arrives through summary ("her lost faith reignited") without dramatizing the precise moment of change. Her "warmly curious" trait manifests in questions and exploration but lacks a clear cost or trade-off in difficult moments.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to find meaning in margins is consistent and drives his actions, but his internal state remains relatively static—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The piece establishes clear traits (secretive, nostalgic, inventive) that inform choices, yet lacks the embodied emotional complexity and degradation under pressure that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to uncover conspiracies through "unheard stories" drives consistent choices, from feigning foolishness to secretly decoding stellar charts. Her internal contradiction—playing the fool while possessing sharp analytical skills—manifests through concrete actions like "muttering foolish rhymes" while calculating vectors. The closure choice to slip evidence to an ally demonstrates earned agency with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to reclaim an unspoken apology—and her internal conflict between pride and regret drives meaningful choices. The final act of "releasing" through spiritual evocation shows genuine transformation with visible emotional cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("fierce tenderness," "cryptic nature") rather than embodied specificity, and the sister remains a cipher without distinctive presence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear and rooted in her orphaned past, with concrete embodied details like the "lotus-hearted ache." However, "shrewdly innocent" reads as a label without dramatized contradiction, and Jamal remains passive throughout, limiting dynamic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to rediscover lost creative joy is clear and drives the narrative, with concrete embodiment through his interaction with the fresco fragment and light-painting. The internal journey from café malaise to renewed artistic purpose shows genuine transformation. However, the piece relies on summary statements like "driven by a deep motivation" rather than fully dramatizing the internal conflict, and the emotional progression feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly in the pause moment—exchanging certainty for curiosity—with embodied tension through the hobo nickel's warmth and her methodical positioning. The nested awakening in Elias shows genuine transformation through concrete sensory layers rather than abstract realization, though some interior phrasing ("insatiable need for facts") edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation rooted in rebellion against thought taxation, with concrete embodied actions (planting seeds, murmuring incantations). His "charming rogue" trait manifests through specific interactions and jest. However, internal contradiction remains mostly declared rather than simultaneously acting in scene, and the final choice lacks the visceral cost needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like singing half-lullabies and creating spectral flowers. The transformation from isolation to "shyly unstoppable" action feels earned through the galaxy postcard catalyst. However, interiority relies on abstract poeticisms ("centuries of longing weaving through her veins") rather than sharp psychological specificity, and the emotional arc resolves too cleanly into "watchful wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving forgotten names as a "quiet defiance against oblivion." Her systematic care contrasts effectively with the foxglove regret that "deepened" as she works. The character shows genuine internal conflict between her dedication and the weight of inevitable loss, though some passages drift toward abstraction rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "cautious exuberance" drives meaningful choices through the ink ritual, though her internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied rather than labeled. The trust restoration arc lands with visible cost in renewed partnership, but Thorne remains somewhat passive after his initial skepticism cracks. The final choice to bind through magical promises shows character-specific agency, yet peak emotional states rely on abstractions ("hope tempered by fear") rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between "brutal precision of engineering against the wild mercy of nature's floods" provides clear motivation that drives the story. The character evolves from division to unity through concrete discovery and realization, though some passages lean toward abstract articulation rather than embodied emotion ("conflicting impulses align").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to preserve lost songs while learning to trust again creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in his hesitant reveal to Mira. The progression from isolation through tentative connection to "blooming trust" follows clear causality, though some transitions feel slightly rushed. His use of the meteorite as a talisman against "pure delusion" shows concrete embodiment of abstract struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand sacred thresholds drives consistent action, and her "featherly determined" trait manifests through concrete behaviors. The final choice to speak weather codes and cross back home shows earned agency with visible cost (her long separation). However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("burned softly," "fractured hush") rather than embodied emotion, and the father remains a distant memory figure without contradictory depth.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "softly ingenious" trait manifests in tool modification, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("rhythm of belonging") without sufficient embodied emotion. The relationship with Lir offers some pressure but arrives late without building sufficient crucible tension. Final synchronization feels unearned given limited prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation from isolation to acceptance of transience works, but the interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("cheerful gloom," "sea-foam recollectionist") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "embrace the scatter" lacks visible cost—she gains wisdom without losing anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's analytical mind and orchestrated spontaneity create a consistent character logic, with his chess-piece manipulation and crowd-reading showing purposeful contradiction. The final transformation of strangers into participants demonstrates earned change. However, the crowd members lack distinct embodiment beyond role labels, and some interior phrasing ("calculated wilderness," "orchestrated serendipity") relies on conceptual abstractions rather than lived specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to defy the nostalgia ban through cosmic verse is clear, but her character remains largely defined by abstract concepts rather than embodied contradiction. The "spontaneously anchored" trait manifests as stated fact rather than dramatized struggle. While obsidian grace colors her movements poetically, we lack concrete internal conflict beyond the abstract tension between exile and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to find worth in the mundane is consistent and drives his meditative actions, though interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion. His communion with the pond shows character-specific perception, but the epiphany about glass holding "luminous worth" feels unearned—no prior struggle or contradiction sets up this realization. The piece maintains POV coherence but lacks the internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's scarred firefighter identity is well-established with concrete details, but his emotional arc relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized choice. The interaction with Lena provides some relationship pressure, though her appearance feels convenient. Internal conflict exists but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "logical dreamer" who approaches hope through mathematical formulas is distinctive and well-embodied through concrete actions like arranging shells in spirals. The character shows genuine internal contradiction between calm surfaces and turbulent undercurrents, though the emotional progression toward triumph feels slightly rushed in the final third without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation builds from abstract (walls' dreams) to concrete family burden through discovered diaries, with her "sensitively perceptive" trait enabling specific actions like distinguishing "a sigh from a creak." The transformation from fleeing legacy to embracing repair duty lands with cost, though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous rather than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The borrowed heartbeat concept provides clear motivation, but Elowen remains abstract—we never see concrete internal conflict beyond the task at hand. The piece tells us she's "perceptively calm" repeatedly but doesn't embody this through specific contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her emotional state feels performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied exhaustion ("mustered her resolve, drawing deep breaths") and the price of her role's erasure, but lacks internal contradiction in peak moments. Her operatively gentle approach remains consistent without wavering, missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses (amoral philanthropist vs. secret sentimentality) act simultaneously throughout, creating genuine internal tension. The final choice to release the egg shows embodied emotion and cost, though some passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("haunted by echoes") rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to defy conformity drives consistent action through untangling threads to harvest echoes, with visible cost in her isolation. However, the character lacks internal contradiction in scene—her defiance feels too pure, missing the credible irrationality or self-deception that would elevate characterization. The "chaste courtesan" concept creates interesting tension but needed more embodied struggle between roles.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between subversive craft and ethical storytelling drives genuine tension. The "uncommonly serene" demeanor masking inner tempests works well, though the epiphany about puppets reversing agency feels slightly unearned without more dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation as an "esoteric realist" finding mysticism in measurable patterns is conceptually intriguing but remains abstract rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. The character makes deliberate actions (building structures, knotting the moth wing) but these feel ritualistic rather than revealing internal contradiction or cost. Her childhood backstory of "forgotten valleys where elders spoke of wings" attempts depth but lacks the specificity that would make her obsession feel inevitable rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal journey from self-forgiveness to preservation drives concrete choices. However, her emotional progression feels too smooth—the "snowmelt ardor" never truly conflicts with doubt or difficulty, and her expertise makes the rope reconfiguration feel predetermined rather than struggled for.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her foresight-in-hindsight ability creates genuine internal conflict. The dream sequence revelation about paths choosing walkers to "balance the world's decay" provides earned insight. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—her acceptance comes without sufficient struggle against the revealed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent (devotion to cosmic mysteries), but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his "trembling hands" and "steady voice" are the only physical manifestations of tension. The final transformation feels more stated than earned through accumulated pressure, though his frugal nature and encrypted devotion create some character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's scheming pacifism manifests through calculated empathy and the music box deployment, with internal consistency maintained throughout. Thorne's transformation from armored resentment to release feels earned through the cellular memory sequence, though his initial characterization relies slightly on told backstory ("lifetime of betrayals"). The final renunciation carries visible emotional cost through tears and physical surrender of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—capturing his runaway dream of glass mountains—with embodied emotional work through synchronized breathing and concrete micro-choices (arranging mirror shards, adjusting angles). The internal contradiction between his "firmly grounded" pragmatism and the dream's pull creates authentic tension that drives the closure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the dream's nature that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation through concrete actions (mending the quartz eye with the ribbon), and his internal conflict between persistence and loss resonates. However, the piece relies on abstract concepts ("deciduous vows," "generational wisdom") without fully embodying them in scene-level choices, and the wanderer/seeker who appears late lacks characterization beyond functional purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's bewilderment and pursuit of forbidden knowledge create consistent motivation, with concrete embodiment through trembling hands and pressing the cameo to her forehead. The visions sequence effectively layers contradictory impulses (inheritance vs. warning), though some passages slip into abstract philosophizing ("nonlinear threads binding her to an eternal, bewildered curation") that dilute embodied character work.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation burns clear and her resourceful nature drives concrete choices, particularly in using the botanical diary to expose the guardian's blind spot. The character shows genuine expertise through specific actions rather than labels. However, interiority tends toward ornate description over embodied contradiction, and the emotional stakes of the rescue missions remain abstract rather than viscerally felt through her body and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to find her chimeric twin is clear and rooted in discovery trauma, with embodied emotional states ("fog—and her fracturing mind—erased them both"). The internal conflict between seeking and losing herself is present, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Micro-choices like speaking aloud to weave narrative threads reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's methodical nature and adaptability drive her choices throughout, with concrete embodiment ("fingers callused from years"). However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she proceeds with steady purpose without meaningful struggle or blind spots that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her mapkeeper lineage, with concrete embodied details like "clutched the echo chamber stone" showing internal tension. The final choice to invoke the bloom of hush is earned through prior ritual steps, though some interiority relies on exposition ("the last of her line, bore the weight") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the need to prove meaning in coincidence, though her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene. The "retrocognitively blessed" gift provides specific character texture, and her final choice to rekindle the beacon carries visible cost through sustained effort. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("threads woven with meaning") rather than concrete, embodied experience during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve collective memory drives consistent action throughout, with internal contradiction between mourning future losses and fighting to preserve. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait manifests concretely in her measurements and vows. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("sculpt identity from experience") rather than embodied emotion, and the final smile feels unearned given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "defy the pull of defeat through creation's fierce joy" drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied emotions like trembling fingers and the rag as "talisman against creeping doubt." The transformation from wandering despair to "anchored in creation's unyielding spark" feels earned through concrete actions. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("creeping doubt," "fierce joy") rather than specific embodied states, and the final emotional resolution arrives slightly too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's warmly observant nature manifests through concrete actions—tracing pools, noting stellar reflections, placing the jade cicada tangentially—while Thorne's weariness and scarred uncertainty create genuine tension. The motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives specific choices and methods. Minor deduction for Elara's insight arriving somewhat neatly packaged in dialogue ("rough where we cling, fluid where we release") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against her father's profession, and her quest to collect silence flavors shows specific, embodied motivation. The porcelain doll as a physical anchor for intangible collection works well. However, the father remains functional rather than fully realized, and some emotional transitions feel slightly managed.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to transform silence into comfort is well-grounded and drives his careful modulation of the journey. His internal consistency holds through micro-choices like adjusting sails to muffle noise and releasing the storm glass mist. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around silence/comfort that could be more embodied, but the character arc from routine operator to active comforter lands with earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (finding the throne to restore humanity's essence), but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—she feels "wisely adventurous" as a label rather than conflicting impulses. The "futuristic nostalgia" operates as told emotion ("her heart tugged") rather than embodied perception. No meaningful character change occurs; she simply achieves her goal without visible cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "teach the suffocating to breathe" drives a complex internal arc where she burns bridges as surgical excision, not rage—a nuanced character choice. The contradiction between her role as "tender shadow keeper" and her deliberate isolation creates genuine tension. However, the companion exists only as abstract concept without embodied presence, and Elara's emotional progression relies on telling ("smiled faintly") rather than embodied cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is consistently rooted in her pyramid scheme survival, driving her "virtuously mischievous" approach. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during the key transformation scene - she decides to "play along" too easily without wrestling with trust issues that should plague a scam survivor.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal journey from uncertainty to liberation reads authentically. The revelation about his illegitimate birth works as earned discovery, though his emotional response lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the character work. His "eloquent silence" effectively embodies his processing, but the too-smooth transition from dynasty-ending revelation to liberation feels slightly undercooked.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen's transformation from isolation to purposeful engagement is earned through concrete discovery and pattern-work, with contradictory impulses (solitude vs. call to action) acting simultaneously. The unsnapping of his breastplate carries symbolic weight as a micro-choice revealing values. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("shivering bliss" repeated without varied embodiment) and some emotional transitions feel convenient rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza's grief-driven motivation and transformation from brokenness to "tentative mending" through discovering Josiah's story creates genuine character arc with embodied emotion ("ink-stained fingers," "perpetual shadow under her eyes"). The parallel between her loss and Josiah's separated family drives meaningful change. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional processing ("something tactfully hopeful") rather than fully embodied response.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment of her resourcefulness through the puddle-map reading. However, Kael's sudden appearance lacks sufficient setup, and the resolution feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality. The "tyranny of indifference" remains abstract without embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and grounded in the grandmother's prophecy, with the loss of voice adding embodied stakes. The character shows consistent traits through action (positioning at threshold, playing through negative space), though internal contradiction could be stronger. The final renunciation/silencing carries visible cost in "weight of generations lift," but the emotional progression relies heavily on abstraction rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation to decode the leaves drives concrete actions throughout, with her transformation from orderly sorter to intuitive reader earned through the moonstone's touch. The internal shift from methodical to poetic feels credible, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied—particularly the "mossy delight" which reads more as labeled than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with clear internal conflict between Elias's clockmaker precision and desire for uncertainty. The "uncertainly certain" attribute is well-integrated and drives micro-choices throughout. His transformation feels earned through the journey, with embodied contradictions and genuine flawed complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elarion's guilt and alchemical expertise create clear motivation for his kintsugi ritual, with concrete embodiment through trembling hands and luminous regret. The internal conflict between his failure and redemptive drive operates in scene through the crucible mending. However, Lirra remains absent without dramatized relationship dynamics, and some passages drift toward abstract reflection rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss driving her soul-collecting purpose, with concrete embodied details like "fingers, callused yet gentle" and the physical act of stringing the tooth onto the harp. The "modestly fearless" trait manifests through specific action rather than label, and Thorne's spectral psychology shows genuine complexity. However, some diagnostic phrasing ("unspoken burdens," "weight of betrayals") and the overly articulate resolution dialogue ("Healing isn't in silence...") reduce authenticity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "discover the mathematics of mercy" drives meaningful choices, particularly his deliberate self-triggering of trauma responses through the pewter strap. The internal contradiction between seeking forgiveness and forcing himself to relive betrayals creates authentic tension. However, the mathematical framing of mercy feels conceptual rather than embodied, and his emotional progression relies on abstract formulations ("mercy growing only after thresholds of suffering were crossed") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories drives consistent choices through the lens fragment's use and the painting's decipherment. Her internal conflict between childhood loss and present purpose creates genuine tension, though some passages drift into abstract meditation rather than embodied emotion ("elusively tangible weight of the fragment pressing like a promise").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's gift for seeing ghosts and analyzing patterns drives meaningful choices, particularly when he decides to engage with the mainspring barrel and interpret the dust patterns. However, the meta-commentary disruptions ("Wait, that's over—adjusting for count") and revision notes embedded in the text severely undermine character immersion. The motivation to discover what ceilings hide manifests concretely through his investigative actions.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "compress eternity into a moment" drives consistent action through discovery to transformation. His trembling fingers and pounding heart embody emotion concretely. However, the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he proceeds without meaningful hesitation despite the catastrophic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from defunct revolutionary to cultural architect is well-motivated through concrete actions (etching verses on shard, creating ceremony). The "burnished sorrow" effectively embodies his emotional state throughout. However, the supporting cast remains functional rather than fully realized, and some internal transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("tentative hope").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to reclaim stolen light is clear and consistent, driving his meticulous actions toward the covenant's repair. His internal state shows through embodied details like "nimble fingers" and "hummed a tinkersong," though moments of internal contradiction under pressure are limited. The decisive moment where he banishes doubt to steady the chip demonstrates character-specific response to crisis, earning the closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's characterization succeeds through consistent trait-action alignment ("sensibly eccentric" manifests in her petrichor collection and psychometry tool), and her motivation deepens from collecting scents to pursuing deeper mysteries. The psychometry vision sequence shows contradictory impulses (thrill/dread) acting simultaneously. However, she lacks meaningful internal conflict during key decisions, and the emotional progression feels overly smooth without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve the timewoven alliances is clear and drives her sculpting action, but her internal state reads more as wonderment than contradiction. The "perpetually learning" trait functions but lacks embodied cost or tradeoff. Her final choice to carry the magic forward shows agency, though the emotional complexity remains surface-level without genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's quiet obsession with understanding nocturnal blooms creates consistent motivation, and her final realization connects grandmother's hidden love to her own artistic practice with earned resonance. However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gentle obsession that whispered," "riddle of the heart") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional progression from seeking to understanding lacks intermediate struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover truth is clear and consistent, driving her actions from archive to lagoon. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("solemn face etched with weight") rather than embodied contradiction, and the spectral informant negotiation lacks concrete character-specific choices that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to reimagine civilization through sustainable means rather than magic is clear and consistent, with his rejection of false comfort driving the central choice. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual planning rather than embodied emotion—his working memory sequence reads more like exposition than lived experience. The shift from solitude to community arrival feels abrupt without dramatized intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in his childhood oath evolving into life's work, with the final choice to "immerse not just relics, but his guarded heart" earning a meaningful internal shift. However, the emotional progression relies on abstract labels ("velvet disquiet," "loneliness of a scribe") rather than embodied contradiction, and the diagnostic self-awareness in "hoarded none" undermines crisis authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's "furiously tranquil" contradiction manifests effectively through her methodical seed-planting while racing against temporal chaos. The character's motivation to understand "borrowed time's texture" drives concrete actions, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("threads of cosmic order"). Her final smile after fulfilling duty shows earned change through specific struggle with the vortex inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve quiet is clear and consistent, driving his choice of bell over siren. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we get description of his contemplative nature but minimal struggle between opposing impulses during the crucial decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's spiritually curious nature and vulnerability drive consistent choices, but his transformation lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene—the epiphany about "flourishing stillness" arrives through abstract realization rather than dramatized struggle. The final stance crystallization has conceptual weight but minimal felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's tranquil perceptiveness drives concrete micro-choices throughout (tracing patterns, handling the box, choosing silence over speech), with his astonishment at the ghosts creating genuine internal tension. The final choice to preserve rather than speak shows clear motivation with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract interiority ("profound unraveling") and limited embodied emotion during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand "the texture of time passing" drives consistent choices through discovery, decoding, and reconstruction. The transition from borrowed-time keeper to embodiment of timelessness earns its resonance through accumulated detail, though some interiority borders on abstract ("time's texture unfolding not as passage but as an eternal tapestry").

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives consistent choices through shell-tending, kite-flying, and poem-writing. The internal progression from melancholy to acceptance feels earned, though some interiority slides into abstract philosophizing ("harmonizing the discord") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by terminal diagnosis toward legacy-building. His "brazen calm" manifests through methodical work despite mortality, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The transformation from caretaker to "guardian of secrets" shows meaningful change with visible cost (cancer initially, then mysterious healing).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "luminous skepticism" drives meaningful choices—lifting the amber and accepting the envoys' presence—with internal contradiction between doubt and wonder effectively embodied. The transformation from "academically rebellious" skeptic to one whose "doubts alight with new wonder" feels earned through concrete interaction with the amber. Motivation is clear but the peak moment relies on abstract "alchemy" and "chemistry" language rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to transform battlefield into garden is well-rooted, with his specific ability to speak dead languages enabling the bird-call translation that drives action. The internal complexity of redemption-through-cultivation works, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("narrowing the vast sea into a sliver of endless ink") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Harlan's motivation to bridge distance from Elara is embodied through concrete actions (tracing the cylinder, clutching the waxen leaf) with contradictory impulses between seeking truth and fearing revelation. The discovery that Elara survived but chose separation creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("reluctant heroism") in the resolution beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's contradictory status as "blessed pariah" creates genuine internal tension, and her temporal sensitivity drives concrete choices. The final reconciliation with her mother's echo feels earned through accumulated detail, though some interiority veers toward explanatory ("transforming the disorientation into fuel for discovery").

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as "apprentice of wonder" who must "embrace the unknown with open arms" drives the chess-swapping sequence coherently. The character shows genuine struggle through "sweat beaded on his brow despite the cold" and measured risk-taking, though internal contradiction could be sharper. His chivalrous code manifests in mercy toward spectral guardians, and the final transformation from "thieving hands" to "architects of balance" lands with earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to chronicle "small gestures" drives consistent choices, and her transformation from crisis actor to survivor provides clear internal logic. The "benevolently ruthless" attribute manifests in her unbinding ritual—gentle yet unyielding. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") rather than embodied emotion, and the flood trauma feels more declared than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen's motivation to reclaim her lost homeland drives consistent choices throughout, with internal conflict between suppressing painful memories and needing to understand "the shape of home." The mercury-glass physiology creates distinctive embodied perception ("mercury swirled in her glass-veined eyes"), though some emotional states lean abstract ("clawed at her mind with thorns"). The final transformation from exile to architect shows earned change through accumulated visions and stone-work.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to forgive himself drives concrete actions throughout, from fidgeting with chess pieces as purposeful winnowing to descending into the labyrinth. The internal contradiction between guilt and redemption plays out through embodied choices, particularly in the labyrinth confrontation with spectral accusations. However, the resolution ("whispered absolution to his reflection") edges toward therapeutic tidiness rather than earned complexity with lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's defiant artist motivation drives coherent action through the poetry sessions, with her "innocently mischievous" trait embodied in how she transforms grave confessions into "playful riddles." The internal contradiction between her artistic rebellion and the weight of multiplied truths creates genuine tension, though the secondary characters lack sufficient pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's uncertainty and alchemical failures create consistent internal conflict, with embodied details like "trembling hand" and "lungs burning." The kintsugi metaphor drives meaningful character arc from fragmented doubt to "golden certainty," though some emotional transitions feel compressed. His motivation to "weave purpose from unraveling threads" compels the ritual's urgency with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief/nostalgia, with concrete embodiment in the cave descent and shell painting. The "intimately aloof" trait manifests consistently through his guarded nature and private vow. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneity—his choices feel sequential rather than torn—and the final renunciation/acceptance lacks sufficient dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to prove that "whispers travel farther than shouts" drives concrete action through the vial's uncorking and the garden ritual. The internal contradiction between his "screaming tenderness" and methodical belief creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "vibrations of intent" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's lunar-influenced clarity fluctuates believably through embodied details like "fingers brushed the patina bronze censer foot" and his grip during doubt. His motivation to build a voice network after his wife's departure feels earned through specific loss rather than abstract grief. The "patchwork" nature manifests in concrete actions—salvaging radios, encoding nautical riddles—though some interior passages lean toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to cultivate psychological safety through gentle deceptions creates genuine internal contradiction against his involuntary truthfulness curse, earning the story's central tension. The glass eye implantation represents a credible, earned choice with visible physical cost ("Pain bloomed like a hidden fungus"). However, the emotional progression feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph, and the community members remain abstract rather than embodied presences applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's gift of "borrowing memories from objects" creates strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers trembling not from the chill"). The final act of pinning the boutonnière shows earned change through acceptance of shared isolation. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("isolation was his creed") but the contradictory impulses (eccentric nature drawing him to souls vs. maintaining isolation) act effectively in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's loneliness and empirical intuitive gift create genuine internal tension, particularly when following the ants leads to discovery. His motivation crystallizes convincingly from passive grief to active pursuit. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("empirically intuitive mind") but the final choice to step through the portal carries visible cost as waters rise.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's disenchantment and dream-driven motivation are established early and maintained, though her internal contradiction operates more through summary than embodied scene work. The shared exhale with Lirian revealing mutual dreams provides a concrete micro-choice, but the resolution through "softly commanding will" channeled into an incantation lacks the embodied specificity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characters remain somewhat abstract despite vivid world-building; their internal states are often told through elevated description rather than embodied contradiction ("scientifically romantic in their gleam: logic laced with longing"). The transformation moment works but lacks the visceral internal conflict that would elevate it—Thorne's confession feels rehearsed rather than torn from him under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to capture and distill chaos drives consistent action, with internal conflict between envy of past selves and acceptance. The chronological confusion and feral nostalgia create genuine psychological complexity. However, the emotional progression toward peace feels somewhat swift given the depth of existential anxiety established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's loss of smell and subsequent identity shift is well-established with concrete embodiment (handling the screw, her past roles), and Silas provides decent secondary pressure through shared grief. However, the emotional progression relies heavily on reflection rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and the final choice to pocket the restored screw lacks visible cost—she simply walks away lighter.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform traumatic scars into healing runes is clear and embodied through the physical crystallization of doubt in her veins. The internal conflict between scholarly knowledge and childhood superstition creates genuine tension, though the resolution feels slightly rushed without fully dramatizing the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in guilt, with concrete embodied emotions like "skin tingled" and "veins gritty." The reconciliation choice feels earned through established causality, though Theo's characterization remains somewhat thin as a spectral outline. Internal conflict between pride and regret drives authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The witness's motivation to unravel cosmic illusions is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in the spiral arbitration sequences. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings ("chronicles of universes born and extinguished") rather than concrete embodied emotion. The character's endurance as "eternal vigil" keeper offers some depth, but lacks visceral internal conflict beyond intellectual puzzlement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand time's deeper meaning is clear and drives the key reversal sequence, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract rather than embodied. His internal conflict between routine duty and philosophical yearning creates genuine tension. The final shift to "guardian of time's true measure" lands conceptually but lacks visible emotional cost beyond the thin line of blood.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand "the physics of letting go" drives genuine internal conflict and embodied stress, particularly in her spatial gift's holographic precision contrasting with emotional inability to release. The familiar stranger's reveal as Dr. Lorne connects meaningfully to her brother wound, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Internal contradictions play out concretely through her security instincts warring with intuitive pull toward the stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal contradiction between theoretical rebellion and responsibility drives genuine complexity, particularly in how she interprets her father's gambling as "lucid contradictions" rather than simple vice. The embodied grief through "clover-scented melancholy" and physical interaction with artifacts avoids emotional abstraction. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("widening perspectives") that echoes the prompt language rather than emerging organically from character.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—teaching endings to begin through cultivated estrangement—and drives his interactions with Clara. The wrong number friendship shows internal contradiction between connection and deliberate severance. However, Clara's arc feels rushed; her resolution to call her sister "one last time, not to mend, but to release" arrives too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve small moments is consistent and embodied through walnut-ink staining and methodical archival work. The internal journey from solitary reflection to active covenant renewal shows credible development. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("haunted euphoria," "weight of small moments") rather than concrete embodied emotion, and the epiphany about renewing the covenant feels somewhat unearned given the thin dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's desperate need for connection drives consistent choices throughout, with his jocular facade cracking to reveal genuine loneliness. The final choice to leave while acknowledging "cure's in the sharing" shows earned understanding with visible cost. Internal contradiction between his helping nature and inability to receive is embodied through action, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the tower scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her skin's language-absorption attribute, with internal conflict between guilt and the need for forgiveness dramatized through concrete sensory details. The final choice to accept forgiveness is earned through accumulated emotional pressure, though some passages edge toward diagnostic self-awareness ("the guilt of surviving when her family did not").

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in regret over the severed relationship with her brother, driving her to edit history. The "confidently uncertain" trait manifests believably as she activates the pen's protocol. However, the emotional arc resolves too cleanly—the brother simply reappears in collaborative visions without showing the cost of this alteration or what Elara sacrifices to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's hollow longing and Lir's mysterious presence create consistent motivation, with the empty camera as embodied metaphor working well. The transformation from isolation to connection through mapping silence shows genuine character movement with visible cost. However, the fishermen's sudden appearance feels convenient, and Elias's ability to instantly translate silence into haunting melody strains credibility at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as arsonist-turned-seeker is clear and consistent, with her "analytically intuitive" nature driving believable choices through the archive exploration. The connection to Lirael creates a meaningful parallel, though the emotional arc relies heavily on abstract concepts ("volcanic tenderness") rather than embodied reactions, and the final vow lacks concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore her bond with Kai through memory entanglement is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly her rejection of protocols to drum coded messages. The "quietly rebellious" trait manifests in concrete actions with visible cost. However, Kai remains more concept than character, and some interior phrasing tends toward the abstract ("auroral sorrow") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation builds coherently from his decade of solitary work to his core belief that "whispers travel farther than shouts," with his rescue of Marco serving as earned proof. His uncanny ability to identify walks from echoes functions as lived expertise that enables the rescue. Minor deduction for some expository interiority ("turning the labyrinth into his personal archive of gaits") that tells what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's "spiralingly calm" movements and silent teaching methodology show consistent characterization, while Elara's grief-driven journey demonstrates clear motivation. However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—her shift from darkness to light happens through passive observation rather than active choice, and the dental mirror's symbolic use lacks the embodied struggle needed for a fully earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's gift of hearing unspoken words drives his chess-coach methodology of planting "second thoughts" through silent rebellion, with clear motivation. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("humble rebellion," "dormant defiance") rather than embodied emotion, and Mira functions more as extension than pressure-applying force. The cradling of the chess king provides some embodiment but doesn't generate sufficient internal contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's transformation from denial to acceptance is well-motivated through the scrimshaw's mystical properties and the whale's call, with her "guarded heart" and suppressed merfolk heritage creating genuine internal conflict. The final choice to embrace her true nature carries visible cost (losing her dock worker identity) though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's blank-faced performer identity creates genuine internal contradiction between her past role and current grief, with the whittling scene revealing values through micro-choices. The moral ambiguity of her propaganda work that "whispered doubts to those who listened in the dark" adds authentic complexity without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's aesthetic drive manifests through concrete action (touching pillars, wading into water), and her transformation from hesitation to "bold passage" carries visible cost. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "tremor of certainty" rather than embodied contradiction, and the character lacks specific flaws that complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Characters show consistent traits and clear motivation, with Elias's colorblind perspective driving unique choices and Thorne's bartered awakening creating genuine stakes. The final exchange carries visible cost, but internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than explained, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's yearning for connection is embodied through concrete actions with the bell and lens, showing contradictory impulses between isolation and reaching out. The powerfully gentle trait manifests in specific moments like "hush a storm or summon a whisper." However, the resolution relies heavily on abstract realizations ("texture of bonds, woven from questions") rather than earned dramatic cost, and some interiority drifts into therapy-speak ("forged unbreakable bonds").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's grief-driven transformation from despair to teaching renewal is well-motivated with concrete embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "grief-worn skin"). The final choice to help Lira while simultaneously healing herself shows genuine internal contradiction resolved through action. Deductions for occasional therapy-speak ("yearned to teach others—and herself—to wither no more") and some emotional summary rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's steadily curious nature and cartomancer identity are established with consistent traits, but her crucial transition from personal divination to cultural mapping lacks embodied struggle—the shift happens through explanation rather than dramatized conflict. Theo functions adequately as witness but applies minimal pressure on Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between desire for knowledge and fear of corruption effectively embodied through physical reactions to the atoms of nostalgia. The transformation at closure—accepting chaos to embrace wisdom—is earned through prior struggle. However, some interiority relies on abstract labels ("anguished joy," "untainted heart") rather than concrete embodiment, and the child-self revelation feels slightly convenient despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve hope is clear and rooted in personal loss ("her own faded into silence"), with embodied emotion in tears and the river stone as tactile anchor. The choice to help the shadow shows values hierarchy with visible cost. However, internal conflict remains mostly told rather than simultaneously enacted, and the "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" trait feels more labeled than dramatized through specific perceptual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his gentle nature consistent, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his processing of betrayal reads as sequential reflection rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene. The metaphorical "shedding layers" dominates over concrete character-specific choices. His final stance crystallizes with some cost, but the resolution feels overly tidy ("transformed, walked into the light").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand her scar and survival is consistent, with concrete embodied details like reaching for the hourglass and kneeling to dig. The internal conflict between seeking closure and living with survivor's guilt plays out through action. However, the plant telepathy feels convenient rather than costly, and emotional progression relies on some diagnostic language ("seeker of closure," "singular motivation").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority through the psychometry reading. The parallel between her and Theo's unused love creates genuine resonance. However, the emotional progression relies on telling ("Tears welled as Elara realized") rather than embodied experience, and her transformation happens too quickly without sufficient struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong characterization with clear motivation and earned transformation. Elara's blocked creativity drives purposeful action through a believable arc. The interiority feels authentic to an artist's struggle, though some passages drift toward elevated register. Her final breakthrough emerges organically from prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's dreamlessness creates a compelling void that drives his cultivation motivation, with concrete embodiment through chess clock manipulation and archive interaction. The final smile suggests earned change through "sparks" in his void, though the transformation feels slightly rushed without sufficient prior struggle to fully justify this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to reclaim his "wild frontier" drives consistent choices through translocation and gear discovery, with embodied details like "exhaustion claimed him" and "buzzing with fragments of insight." The character achieves meaningful change through specific struggle, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("tangled map of forgotten ideas") rather than concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal journey from fear-bound to courage-claimed is well-motivated through concrete details like the leash as physical/psychological tether. The ferry guides function more as facilitators than pressure-applying characters, limiting relational dynamics. The closure choice to become a guide herself is earned through her transformation, though some interior passages lean toward abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to understand safety's cost drives genuine internal conflict, with his lost voice and scattered choir creating embodied trauma. The piano bolt discovery triggers concrete memory and choice, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"). His final acceptance of silence as vow rather than curse shows earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as guardian, with internal consistency between her "regally unpretentious" demeanor and methodical approach. The character shows embodied patience and strategic thinking through concrete actions like ink preparation and message placement. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around cosmic balance and slightly convenient resolution of Varak's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her coral bleaching witness trauma. The internal conflict between seeking patterns and accepting loss plays throughout, though her final realization lacks the embodied struggle that would elevate this higher. The tapping rhythm habit provides good character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her barefoot wandering creates embodied specificity, but internal conflict remains mostly told ("awkwardly confident") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation from passive observation to active signal-sending feels earned through the stone circle discovery, though the emotional progression jumps too quickly from contemplation to action without intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's insurgent identity and plant telepathy drive genuine choices with cost, particularly her decision to unseal the embryo despite tradition's warnings. The motivation is clear and consistent, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than summarized ("Her insurgent spirit flared"). The final choice to carry the embryo back shows earned agency with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trauma and recovery are embodied through concrete somatic markers and the freeze response, avoiding therapy-speak labels. The final choice to carry forward shows earned endurance, though some internal passages edge toward over-articulation ("optimism anchored in realism" appears too explicitly). Internal contradictions between grief and hope act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal journey from paralysis to creative renewal is motivated and embodied through the thread-untangling metaphor, but the transformation feels somewhat rushed and lacks sufficient intermediate struggle. The rhetorical questions effectively reveal his self-doubt, though the resolution arrives too smoothly after establishing such deep artistic crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to unravel time's mystery during crisis is clear and rooted in her tracker identity, with embodied details like "serene anger" effectively characterizing her controlled fury. The internal consistency holds through her tactical choices, though the resolution's insight about "cosmic mercy" feels slightly unearned without more dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between duty and forbidden knowledge drives a meaningful choice with visible stakes. Her decision to transmit the letter emerges from consistent characterization, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bravely conflicted," "crystallized"). The final act shows genuine moral complexity as she knowingly commits treason, with embodied details like "fingers trembled slightly" and "steadying breath that echoed like a distant avalanche."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong characterization with clear internal conflict between Elara's pacifist nature and her violent inheritance. Her motivations are consistent and drive meaningful choices, particularly the symbolic decision to sheath rather than wield the knife. Some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing, and emotional states could be more embodied, but the character arc culminates in an earned stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, driving his pursuit of the goddess's echo with "cool-headed" determination that holds under pressure. The internal journey from fractured grief to mended peace lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "transliterating grief" that edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to unearth truth is consistent but her emotional state lacks embodied contradiction during the confrontation. The cousin's trembling hand provides some physical grounding, yet both characters speak in overly articulate, explanatory dialogue ("proving extraterrestrial interference in human affairs") rather than fragmenting under pressure. The rosewood pen nib revelation works as a micro-choice but the resolution feels too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's guilt-driven motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details (the tattoo on her son's arm, her trembling hands). The final transformation from guilt to forgiveness feels earned through the accumulated pressure, though some interiority veers toward therapeutic articulation ("the guilt's echo silenced at last").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to find meaning in chaos drives concrete actions (creating the mandala, using the tile flake), and her social perceptiveness enables specific interventions that shape the group dynamic. The transformation from discord to "emergent hush" carries visible cost in the lingering "lilac unease," though interiority relies on some abstract phrasing ("whimsical spirit rebelled") rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete retrocognitive visions that trap her in others' pain, driving her "aberrant mercy" toward the ritual renaming. The internal contradiction between being trapped by the past yet using it as a tool for healing works well. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around "gentle radical" and "warm coldness" that occasionally drifts toward conceptual labels rather than embodied states.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliza's synesthesia creates a distinctive perceptual signature ("sounds blooming into colors, touches whispering tastes"), and her despair from the theater troupe's end motivates her maze navigation. The ghost character applies immediate pressure through the tarot coin exchange and shared performance. However, the transformation from despair to hope feels slightly rushed in the final beats without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's "affectionate skeptic" nature manifests concretely through physical gestures paired with verbal doubt, and Theo's vulnerability about the telepathy pill creates genuine tension. The characters' opposing stances on connection methods drive meaningful conflict, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("where skepticism warred with longing").

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through her sensory mapping actions. However, the piece lacks internal contradiction acting in scene—she experiences no genuine struggle between competing impulses when discovering the fossil, and her transformation from "solitary guardian to herald" occurs without visible cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her desire to free prophecies from fate's grip and offer choices. The final act of sharing the decoded prophecy with villages demonstrates earned change with visible cost (years of patient work). However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("spin rigid prophecies," "raw possibilities") rather than embodied emotion, and no genuine internal contradiction acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation as a burned spy seeking redemption is clear, with her "prudently daring" attribute demonstrated through careful snow-reading. The arrival of Marcus provides relationship pressure that forces choice. However, internal conflict remains mostly told ("unused courage stirred") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "distill complexity into essence" drives a meaningful internal shift from burden to clarity, with the yarn needle providing concrete embodiment. However, the transformation relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized struggle, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's zen-minded phototropism to kindness drives coherent choices throughout, particularly his method of understanding through patient observation and the final realization about compassion's role in resistance. The internal progression from seeking to understanding feels earned, though the epiphany about "sustained compassion" edges toward abstraction. His potter's hands and methodical approach create consistent embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's wistful pragmatism manifests convincingly through contradictory impulses (dreaming of meadows while measuring soil pH), and her final choice to scatter petals while holding the bitting gauge tooth shows layered motivation with visible cost. The protected vulnerability reads authentically through her solitary garden tending and private grief ritual, though some interior passages lean toward reflective summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes effectively from passive isolation to active independence through the sundial discovery, with embodied grief in her "limp and gray" feathers. The transformation from brittle fragility to empowered self-reliance lands with earned cost. However, the spectral Aetherians' appearance lacks sufficient groundwork, and emotional progression through the stone circle sequence feels compressed rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a ghostwriter who has lost her own connection is clear and drives her journey to the temple. Her internal state is well-embodied through concrete details like "heart felt adrift, severed from the thread that connects all things." The transformation from isolation to connection is earned through the discovered letter and reunion, with visible emotional cost in "tears blurred the prismatic quiet."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is consistent and drives her actions through interference with subsonic frequencies. Her cautious hope tempers effectively against Harlan's power play, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than described ("fragile as starlight on fogged glass"). The final choice to disrupt both cosmic and human deception shows earned agency with visible cost as Harlan staggers and community fractures realign.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that drives choices, particularly in narrowing passages where "her resolve held, a quiet rebellion against her own fears." However, the character transformation feels more told than embodied—her phobia lifts "like a spell broken" without sufficient dramatized struggle. The "prudently adventurous" trait manifests in measured exploration but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Face-blindness creates a compelling constraint but remains mostly told rather than embodied through concrete perceptual details. Elara's methodical nature manifests through action but her internal conflict feels abstract ("quiet urge to awaken dormant empathy"). The moment of discovery with the ribbon shows genuine investigation under pressure, yet emotional states read as performed rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor Thorne is clear and consistent, driving her through concrete actions from tracing charts to decoding journals. The "nervously confident" trait manifests believably in her steady voice but stuttering heart. However, interiority relies on some abstract phrasing ("spongey dread") and the emotional arc from dread to hope feels slightly compressed in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal journey from self-doubt to possibility is earned through concrete discovery (the flake) and action (following the scaffold map, playing again), with visible cost in confronting his "never" identity. The motivation is clear and consistent, though some interiority veers toward abstract ("pixelated amnesty" as internal concept). The final choice to play on the arch shows meaningful change through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's "polished calm" functions as both trait and defense mechanism, consistently governing his responses to pressure and driving key decisions. The character shows genuine internal complexity through his relationship with his father's legacy, though the rapid economic collapse at the end lacks sufficient emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her healing-through-words trait manifests in the dream sequence, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The mentor relationship provides emotional grounding through the telegram, yet Elara herself lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she proceeds with serene certainty rather than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen's progression from guarded isolation to understanding shows clear internal contradiction acted in scene, particularly when she hesitates before the seed ("knowing the seed's hunger could turn on her"). The final choice to unbend herself alongside the vortex earns its cost through prior causality. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("warlike serenity," "serene precision") rather than embodied emotion, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's purposeful curiosity drives meaningful choices through scarred wisdom and visionary purpose, with her decision to link through scars representing genuine cost. The tree-consciousness maintains consistent interiority through embodied sensations like "sap in her veins" and "roots straining but holding firm." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "anxious elation" that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "reckless idealist" trait drives her actions consistently, with clear motivation rooted in family loss. The "fiercely gentle" paradox manifests concretely as she approaches the macabre "as if scolding a child while wrapping it in warmth." However, Thorne remains underdeveloped beyond his function as a mirror, and some interiority veers toward abstract labels ("her heart a furnace of unyielding hope").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    Jack's internal wrestling between holding onto and discarding the speaker cloth shows genuine contradictory impulses, and his shift from "bitter mantra" to "motivational hum" earns a credible stance change. However, the resolution feels slightly neat—his epiphany about "quiet sifting after" arrives through reflection rather than dramatized pressure, and the final paragraph's "longing softening into resolve" smooths over complexity without sufficient cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's methodical nature manifests through concrete actions (cataloging the seed's texture, etching notes on bark) and her grief drives meaningful choices. The internal conflict between longing for connection and accepting loss plays out through embodied action rather than mere assertion. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("haunted ambitions surged") rather than specific embodiment, and the emotional arc resolves too smoothly without genuine struggle at the moment of planting.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian's contradictory nature—mechanical yet fluid, rigid under full moon, soft under new—effectively embodies internal conflict through physical transformation. His method of "accepting contradictions" to capture the smelts demonstrates character-specific problem-solving. However, the piece lacks embodied emotional specificity during the actual smelting process, relying on conceptual description over visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through the discovered shell into a coherent drive to "dissolve the walls between hearts," with the pearl's transformation providing earned change. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his hesitation is brief and his choice feels predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal struggle with guilt resonates, but the piece relies heavily on reflection without sufficient embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to play the accordion and leave with it represents a gesture toward self-forgiveness, but lacks the visible cost and earned causality needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and her cautious hope well-embodied through trembling hands and careful documentation. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - wariness and exuberance alternate rather than clash, and the final discovery lacks a genuine cost or renunciation that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal conflict between solitary beauty and empire service drives genuine tension through concrete embodied details (callused fingers hesitating, mulberry ache). The telepathic plant ability and provenance expertise create specific character texture. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("propagate destinies," "perforated destiny") that edges toward conceptual rather than embodied in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve her essence against oblivion is clear and drives the final ritual. The internal contradiction between her role as beautician to the dead and facing her own end creates genuine tension. However, the character remains somewhat archetypal - the lone keeper facing a curse - without deeper psychological complexity that would elevate to the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation flows from forgiveness through seeking contentment to accepting cyclical renewal, with the hairpin vision providing embodied realization. However, the brother's betrayal remains abstract without specific embodied conflict, and Elara lacks internal contradiction during her transformation—she moves too smoothly from seeking to finding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between rigid certainty and embracing nuance drives meaningful choices, particularly the deliberate unhooking of her "cloak of doubt." However, Thorne reads more as a functional device than a fully realized character, and the transformation lacks sufficient embodied struggle—the epiphany arrives too cleanly through wind chime interpretation rather than earned internal wrestling.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to reverse aging is clear and consistent, driving her trance-state exploration. However, interiority remains abstract ("threads of time," "surrender," "dissolution") without embodied emotional contradiction or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to guide others lacks visible personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—centuries of pursuing navigation without movement—and her final choice to merge with the arrowhead's pulse carries visible cost. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("harmonic stone skimmer," "weathered resolve") rather than embodied emotional states, and the piece lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elowen's underachieving nature is stated repeatedly but rarely embodied through specific actions that compound pressure. Her motivation reads clearly but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she simply persists through mild resistance. The final transformation from "underachieving" to "awakened" feels unearned given the minimal struggle dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to fulfill his father's dying wish creates clear internal tension between his mundane lamplighter duties and the impossible quest for synesthesia. His decisive dive into the sunken ship and subsequent discovery show agency under pressure with visible cost. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed in the final beats, and secondary emotional layers remain underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "wavelength align" drives concrete choices (casting coins, discarding them for alignment), with internal contradiction between stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm creating genuine tension. The final transformation from "quiet enthusiast" to leader shows earned change through specific sacrifice, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to transform grief into purpose through naming fears is consistently developed, with his internal contradiction between heartbreak and duty creating genuine tension. The transformation from wound to beacon at closure is earned through accumulated particulars, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's lukewarm magic and brittle devotion create consistent character traits that drive his methodical approach to the bell, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied. The earnest naivety manifests in his dismissal of warnings about futility, and his motivation tied to Lira provides clear stakes. However, emotional states lean heavily on labels ("tepid certainty," "brittle devotion") without sufficient embodied perception, and the resolution's success feels unearned given his established limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's characterization achieves functional depth through his "precisely humane" vigilance and the internal conflict between duty and family grudge. The motivation for reconciliation feels somewhat abrupt - the discovery of photographs alone transforms generations of hatred too easily. His embodied reactions to discoveries are understated but present ("breath caught," "heart thudded").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal contradiction between logic and intuition drives genuine tension through embodied details like tears pricking unbidden. The secretly sentimental core manifests in concrete micro-choices, particularly her preservation of the frozen crystal and response to the starlings. Motivation builds causally from grandmother's buried stories to the climactic ritual, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied stress (trembling hands, muscle memory) and contradictory impulses (doubt versus duty), with her final choice to revise the log carrying visible stakes for colony trust. The "watcher's burden" manifests physically and psychologically throughout. Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing ("suffocating weight of solitary judgment") and occasional diagnostic language that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kai's motivation is clear and drives the action throughout, with meaningful change from numbness to feeling restored. However, the emotional states feel more conceptual than viscerally embodied - "ego death" and "numbness" are told rather than shown through specific physical or behavioral details. The characterization relies heavily on abstract psychological concepts rather than concrete, character-particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied struggle. The seed becomes a catalyst for innovation, yet his internal conflict never manifests as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he simply accepts and plants it. The transformation from stale proprietor to innovator occurs through exposition rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's "mournful eagerness" manifests credibly through his physical conducting and desperate pull-cord yanking. The transformation from grief to restored laughter feels earned through the sustained metaphor of dissolving thorny vines, though the resolution borders on too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen's dimensionally homesick yearning creates consistent motivation, and her transformation from passive waiting to active acceptance shows earned change. The internal conflict between feral instinct and guardian duty operates throughout. Loses points for some diagnostic language ("dimensionally homesick" reads as label) and the convenience of the pendant appearing exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation to escape his ecclesiastical destiny drives clear stakes, and his stoic-sensitive nature manifests through "fingers trembling not from fear but from the deep, unspoken ache of unfulfilled wonder." The transformation from hopeless to reborn alchemist tracks causally through successive experiments. However, internal conflict reads more as sequential states than simultaneous contradiction, and the resolution arrives without sufficient embodied struggle in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—discarding assumptions aloud while tuning signals—with her philosophy "finding beginnings in endings" driving the closure choice. The internal contradiction between her interpreter's need for clarity and her faith in the fragment creates genuine tension. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic self-awareness ("artifacts like this demanded interpretation, not blind faith") that slightly dulls authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's "resiliently positive" trait manifests consistently through action (whistling, calming passengers, maintaining resolve in crisis), and his final choice to use the radio/hourglass combination is motivated by established pattern-recognition skills. However, the transformation lacks internal contradiction during the crisis - he remains uniformly optimistic without visible struggle or cost to his positivity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's fever dream architect identity drives consistent motivation through isolation and connection-seeking, with concrete embodied details like "fingers steady despite the feverish haze." The transformation from seeking to discovering "the gritty, unyielding weave of human ties" shows earned change with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract territory ("texture of connection") without sufficient embodiment, and some emotional transitions lack intermediate states.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "balancedly curious" trait manifests in measured exploration of the chain link, though internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied. The piece relies heavily on telling ("somber marvel," "balanced curiosity") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final stance as "beacon in the unfolding vastness" lacks a visible cost or renunciation that would elevate the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation and persistent curiosity drive credible choices throughout, with embodied tension in "the air hummed with possibility, a reeling hush that pressed against her skin like damp velvet." The character-specific perception and concrete tools elevate this, though the final confrontation with Mira could show more internal contradiction during the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against his mission, with embodied stress ("sweat beaded," "breath shallow"). The motivation to honor Harlan and the forgotten scientists is clear and consistent. However, the scientists themselves remain abstract ghosts rather than individuals, and Elias's transformation feels more procedural than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is grounded in concrete loss (bureaucratic death, isolation) and her methodical approach to defragmenting Elias shows consistent character logic. The heartbeat counting creates genuine interdependence. However, Elara's internal experience during the key defragmentation sequence relies on summary ("quiet determination") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional resolution feels too tidy given the established trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elar's motivation to preserve a dying language through texture-to-sound translation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment like copper veins pulsing and flaring. The curse's visions assault him but he endures, showing internal conflict in scene. However, the resolution lacks a visible personal cost beyond dimming the diamond—no clear sacrifice or transformation marks his character arc at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her brother's loss, driving consistent choices. Her transformation feels earned through the arrowhead's energy and the phone's confessions, though the shift from bitter researcher to willing participant happens somewhat rapidly. Internal conflict between scientific skepticism and longing for answers creates authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and drives action, but lacks internal contradiction or complexity. The transformation from mechanical to organic is earned through persistent musical intervention with visible cost (her aching fingers), though character depth remains somewhat archetypal without specific flaws or blind spots complicating her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation as a respectfully rebellious mailman who believes "true borders dissolved in the ink of unspoken yearnings" drives meaningful choices, particularly in his drone smuggling operation that risks everything to reunite a mother and son. His internal contradiction between following protocols and undermining isolation creates genuine tension, though some moments rely on abstract phrasing ("fragments of lives torn by the endless skirmish") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to "interpret silence as possibility" drives a clear arc from mute craftsman to singer, with the halo fragment catalyzing his transformation. His decades of silence creates genuine internal conflict when he feels compelled to sing, and the cost—breaking his vow—is visible on the page. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final third without enough resistance, and some interiority relies on abstraction ("quietly persistent spirit") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and her sanely eccentric nature manifests through concrete actions (collecting footnotes, methodical scarf ritual). The final moment shows genuine cost as she carries "reawakened echoes into the library's endless night," though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the ritual itself rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between capturing and releasing the dream drives genuine conflict, with embodied grief ("tears blurred the luminous scene"). The transformation from pursuit to acceptance is earned through the concrete ritual of light-painting, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("vitalizing her days with its luminous absence").

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's longing and fear create genuine internal tension, but the locksmith remains a cipher without clear motivation beyond plot function. The protagonist's final transformation from "improbable longing" to "quiet resolve" feels earned through the vision sequence, though the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract states ("cosmic possibility," "boundless connection") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in recovering family folklore, with embodied details like "fingers stained with earth's secrets." The "chronically curious" trait drives her abandonment of routine and descent into the greenhouse. However, her emotional journey feels somewhat linear—the flood of memories arrives without sufficient internal conflict or cost, and the resolution lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her own exile experience, driving her mentorship of Lir with "combative tenderness" that masks vulnerability. The backwards-walking nervousness provides specific embodiment under stress, and her internal conflict between harsh guidance and genuine care plays out through concrete actions. However, Lir remains somewhat generic as a "young wanderer," and the resolution lacks the full emotional cost of transformation despite the earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and rooted in consistent traits (wise pruner, creative fire), with embodied details like "hands scarred yet gentle."

However, the piece lacks genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene - her creativity never conflicts with caution or doubt, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is concrete and emotionally grounded in her brother's death and her secret guilt. The micro-choices of unraveling each knot with increasing urgency show internal conflict acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity and grief-driven motivation are well-established through concrete actions (tracing maps, cross-referencing journals, comparing footage). The internal conflict between scholarly detachment and personal loss creates genuine tension. However, the resolution lacks embodied emotion at the crucial chapel entry—"empathetic weight of ages" remains abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with clear motivation (understanding the physics of letting go) and embodied emotion through the snow globe talisman. Elias's relationship with Mort shows sophisticated internal conflict, and his analytical nature drives meaningful choices. Minor weakness in occasional overwrought introspection, but the character arc from grief to understanding feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation to give voice to the voiceless is clear and consistent, driving her to transform the ghost's code into art. The character demonstrates embodied action through her physical creation of murals, though internal contradiction remains minimal. Her transformation from "seldom-heard" to finally heard provides earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "warmly inquisitive" nature and "affectionate detachment" create a consistent character stance that enables her diary reading, though the emotional progression feels somewhat static. Her motivation to "seek out the joy beneath anguish" drives her investigation credibly, and the final readiness to "serve with newfound light" suggests internal change, but the transformation lacks embodied struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias shows clear internal contradiction between scientific method and emotional need, embodied through his cloud categorization system. His motivation is rooted in grief but drives meaningful choices. The final acceptance represents earned change with visible cost. Some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") but the core characterization holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's face blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her artistic method and discovery. Her motivation to preserve the library through art is clear, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the pivotal book discovery. The final choice to incorporate facial fractals shows credible growth within her established limits.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's curiosity drives concrete discovery choices and her "sociable isolation" creates authentic internal contradiction, though the resolution feels convenient without earned struggle. The polyglot phrasebook discovery and cipher-solving show embodied action under self-imposed pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from lunar-eclipse locksmith to rhythm guardian is earned through concrete micro-choices (uncapping the vial, fitting gears with patient cadence). Internal conflict between fixing surfaces versus syncing with deeper repair rhythms plays out through embodied action. The "driftwood nostalgia" memories effectively layer past apprenticeship with present quest, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("deeper ache pulled her here").

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characters function adequately but lack embodied contradiction and specific interiority. Elias's altruistic ghost motivation is clear but other Grovekin remain generic archetypes (sharp-eyed botanist, wanderers). The collective transformation from strangers to family is told rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly—to offer mercy through the lullaby across lifetimes. The internal tension between duty and compassion manifests through her interaction with the puppet head. However, interiority relies on abstract states ("bruised awe," "reverence born of endless watches") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's reluctance versus duty creates genuine internal conflict, and her motivation to save the travelers drives a meaningful choice with visible cost. However, the transformation feels somewhat mechanical—she moves from reluctance to determination without sufficient embodied struggle, and the "graceless beauty" descriptor relies on telling rather than showing through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's grief and regret drive clear motivation, but the epiphany from foam patterns feels too neat and unearned by prior struggle. The phone call resolution lacks the embodied resistance and cost that would make reconciliation credible after years of estrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to find "where stories begin" drives consistent action through incising and quantifying voids. Her internal conflict between fragmentation and cohesion plays out concretely as she measures absences (lost childhood, unspoken loves). The final choice to fully open her shop carries visible cost - the moonlight's essence is "fully released" - though some interiority relies on abstraction ("driven by a singular motivation") rather than embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's gift of tasting memories provides clear motivation that intensifies through absorption of stored remorse. The internal conflict between her need to heal others and the cost to herself creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical in the pavilion sequence, and the transformation lacks sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's empathetic decisiveness manifests through concrete actions—sensing fractures, acting with "firm tenderness," and navigating the multilingual tensions. Her motivation is clear and drives the entire narrative arc. However, internal contradiction is limited to brief hesitation about rejection, and emotional embodiment relies on some stock phrases ("heart a choral library").

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "chaotically precise" attribute manifests in concrete actions like "fingers mapping fractals in the grit." The transformation from engineer to dream archeologist carries visible cost through physical pain and the burden of others' memories. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during key moments—the transformation proceeds too smoothly without genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's prism-minded perception and drive for discovery create consistent motivation, with her childhood memory of the inversion adding depth. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "latent blaze of discovery" and "fire in her veins" rather than embodied specificity, and the final line about "vigilance that now seeded her soul" reads as thematic summary rather than earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and rooted in her "symphonically minded" nature, with concrete embodiment through her fingers tracing cracks and physical interaction with wood. The character demonstrates consistent traits through action, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the key strumming moment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation through chess metaphor and exile is clear, with concrete embodiment through the worry stone's dent marking "unchecked fury." The final choice to turn from the nexus shows genuine change with visible cost. Internal conflict operates through "hopeful melancholy" and his precise nature wrestling with the chaos of exile, though some interiority leans abstract ("beauty in the difficult" repeated without sufficient embodiment).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's pacifist philosophy drives consistent choices through harmonizing rather than forcing the lock open, and his tears upon reading show embodied emotion. However, his characterization leans heavily on external descriptors (patchwork coat, dove feathers) rather than internal contradiction, and the emotional progression from curiosity to tears feels slightly rushed without sufficient internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to master remedies and cultivate serenity is clear and consistent, with her olfactory sensitivity creating genuine struggle when confronting the corpse flower. However, the transformation from overwhelm to embrace feels somewhat rushed in the final beat, and internal contradiction operates more through summary ("doubts flickered") than simultaneous impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her discovery choice feels earned, but her internal experience remains somewhat generic during the inversion sequence. The final pocketing of the arrow tip shows agency with implied responsibility, though the emotional cost of this discovery could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - cultivating foresight through forensic analysis. His methodical investigation and adaptation to discoveries show embodied expertise. The flight engineer's patch provides a concrete emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her synesthetic gift creates a distinct perceptual signature. However, she lacks internal contradiction or struggle—her journey proceeds without meaningful character-specific obstacles or flaws that would complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in failure-driven redemption, with concrete embodied moments like her trembling fingers on the flute. The internal conflict between control and vulnerability emerges well through the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to quantify emotion through her letterpress work is well-established and drives consistent choices throughout. Her habit of "borrowing personalities" creates genuine internal contradiction when the transposed empathy backfires, pulling her into "lucid turbulence of her own making." The final realization that her borrowing is "a desperate reach for connection" lands with earned psychological cost, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("if emotions followed patterns, she could map them").

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation through grief and duty is well-established, with concrete embodied reactions (trembling hands, fidgeting). The shepherd encounter shows meaningful character change through specific action. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("quiet despair") and slight repetition in describing jitteriness.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong characterization with clear motivation and internal contradiction. Elara's journey from studying others' emotions to confronting her own is well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's wistful longing and stoic endurance are consistently embodied through concrete actions (weaving as communication, unraveling her life's work), and the sacrifice at closure carries genuine emotional weight. However, the piece relies on abstract emotional labels ("wistful gaze," "latent sacrifice") rather than fully embodied contradiction, and secondary elements like the brother remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's meek determination manifests through concrete actions (deliberate hammer strikes, descent into mines) with clear motivation rooted in observing the planet's decay. The internal consistency holds, though the transformation lacks deeper contradiction—his resolve never truly wavers, missing the complexity of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices through the multiverse exploration. The internal conflict between pursuing truth and bearing its weight creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's reticent nature manifests consistently through minimal dialogue and protective silence, with his warmly observant eyes providing concrete embodiment. His decision to continue the letter chain and rebuild the stone stack shows agency under pressure with visible cost—the "luminescent ache" he carries forward. The character arc from solitary skipper to guardian of tradition feels earned, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("unfamiliar ache in his chest") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Herald's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent action, but his characterization relies heavily on mythic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's transformation from watchful guardian to story-magnetizer is well-motivated through the donor heart device, with concrete embodied details like "the donor heart quickened, syncing with the wing's gleam." The internal contradiction between caution and magnetism acts effectively in scene, particularly in the wing examination sequence. However, the epiphany about magnetizing stories arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient prior struggle, and the resolution feels slightly too neat for the complexity established.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's methodical progression from mundane labyrinth maintenance to mystical revelation shows consistent motivation rooted in his obsession with the trees' witness. His micro-choice to map dreams onto the sextant reveals character-specific problem-solving, though some introspection borders on over-articulation ("quantified sorrow—each fracture marking degrees of loss"). The final transformation earns its cost through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (rekindle the dying realm) and her fragmented memory creates genuine internal tension. However, the characterization relies heavily on conceptual description rather than embodied emotion—"her mind a fractured mosaic" tells rather than shows through action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's compassionate reclusiveness drives consistent choices through empathetic perception and the final descent into the Order. His motivation to "unearth wisdom in a mistake" manifests through concrete action rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's guilt-driven motivation is clear and her "heuristically gentle" gardening approach embodies character through action. However, abstract philosophizing about "creeping normality" occasionally replaces embodied emotion, and the internal conflict could sharpen in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her luminous skepticism manifests through concrete details like the taste-shift sensing. However, the weather-carriers' explanation feels too neat ("We are the bridges") without earned complexity, and the final transformation lacks the embodied cost needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between mnemonic gift and creative suppression drives authentic tension, with embodied details like "charcoal-fingered hands itching to touch."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens from professional gift to personal quest for truth. The wilting leaves provide concrete embodied emotion, and her choice to pursue the Vault despite Kael's warning shows credible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's seasonally mute attribute creates genuine constraint that shapes his artistic mission, and his final nodding acknowledgment shows earned satisfaction through witnessed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between nostalgic programming and operational directives drives genuine tension through embodied synthetic pain and heat signatures. The "controlled burn" of miniaturizing fears into manageable fragments shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though some passages lean toward diagnostic language ("protocol he'd long archived") that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded in rescuing her sister, with concrete embodied moments like her dance-as-communication. The character shows genuine vulnerability encrypted as strength through specific actions. However, some passages slip into abstract emotional summary ("calm defiance," "quiet rebellion") rather than fully embodied complexity, and Silas's arc from resistance to cooperation feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation to recover deleted memories is clear and embodied through concrete actions like digging through salt with fluctuating gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's curiosity about old buildings drives consistent choices through tea sessions to rooftop revelation, with her questioning intensifying as trust builds.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes well ("to translate isolation into independence"), and her final choice to archive the memories shows clear agency. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we get description of her skepticism but not competing impulses acting simultaneously.

    Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage drives consistent choices through the ritual, with embodied scars and careful spectral weaving showing character under pressure. The resolution where she frees the ghosts by exposing suppressed affections provides earned closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Hiroshi's philosophical stance and net-mending identity create a consistent character, with internal reflection on hidden patterns driving his choices. The motivation to appreciate hidden effort is embodied through concrete actions (tea-making, net examination, descent to river). However, internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his contemplation proceeds without meaningful opposition or cost to his philosophical pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara's motivation as a conspiracy debunker is clear and drives her choices throughout. Her methodical investigation and final decision to wield the truth despite its cost feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to shape a new dawn is consistent and deepens through isolation into prophetic authority.

    Elias's motivation to become a "translator between generations" drives concrete actions through capturing and releasing sounds. His internal journey from isolation to purpose feels earned, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("lonesome splendor" repeated as label). The final transformation carries genuine emotional weight with visible cost in his tears.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias's protective motivation is clear and his "logically emotional" nature gets some embodiment through calculated technical actions paired with visceral yearnings. However, characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("logically emotional precision," "protective fervor") rather than concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to use sonic absolution feels mechanically predetermined rather than earned through internal struggle with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's progression from observer to leader of patient revolutionaries shows consistent motivation, though her internal contradictions could be more embodied in scene. The transformation of Thorne from "whirlwind of fury" to patient moon-mapper demonstrates earned character change through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("restrained wildness") that could be more specifically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation layers personal trauma (father's corporate cover-up) with professional constraints effectively, and his "fortified vulnerability" manifests through controlled investigation while memories entangle with Clara's. The transition from empirical observer to emotionally implicated actor works, though Clara's characterization relies heavily on archetype. Internal contradiction peaks when Elias experiences Clara's memories viscerally while maintaining his investigative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's guilt and need for tangible atonement drives clear choices, with internal conflict between hurried institutional prayers and deeper human connection. The clockwork heart's repair parallels his emotional journey effectively, though peak moments could embody contradiction more viscerally rather than through reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by "steady curiosity" that manifests through concrete actions. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we're told about her doubts but don't see them actively warring with her drive. The final activation of the yearning algorithm represents earned change, though the emotional cost remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to uncover hidden data drives consistent action, and her choice to lie twice shows meaningful agency with visible stakes. However, internal conflict remains largely intellectual rather than embodied—she "hesitates" but we don't feel contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final decision to protect the secret shows clear values hierarchy but lacks the visceral cost that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's peacekeeper role and intuitive nature are established clearly, and her choice to use empathy-driven understanding shows consistent motivation. The fishermen's hidden pains revealed through the mirrors provide specific embodied backstory. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat - the men's anger dissolving immediately upon hearing their shared losses lacks the messiness of real emotional negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is embodied through concrete actions (volunteering, trawling stories, fingering the parasol tip). Internal contradiction appears when she grips reality "loosely" yet pursues precise auditory knowledge. The final choice to guide others during the storm shows earned endurance, though Kai's presence feels more functional than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's internal contradictions between solitude and connection manifest through embodied details (tracing the burned letter, clutching her coat), and her final choice to extend hospitality carries visible cost—opening her guarded space to a stranger. The dialogue between Elena and Liam maintains distinct voices and reveals character through indirection, though some passages drift toward therapy-speak ("intersubjective understanding," "destined mismatch") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elar's motivation to preserve the prophet's wisdom is clear and consistent, driving him through the consecration ritual. However, his internal experience remains somewhat abstract - we get "quiet ache" and "unfeigned resolve" but little embodied emotion or concrete interiority during the crucial ritual. The "strangely honest" trait manifests mainly as narrative assertion rather than complicating his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform pain into healing is clear and consistent, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract descriptions ("perceptively calm," "subtle puzzle archivist") rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional arc progresses smoothly without the credible irrationality or simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization. Her final action of gathering photos represents agency but lacks a decisive cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his weathered innocence comes through, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("vanishing era of fixed meanings") rather than embodied emotion. The character's scholarly reticence is told more than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. No meaningful character change occurs—the ending simply affirms his existing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction, with visions of future success immediately lost to memory gaps, driving concrete actions like chalk marking and driftwood arranging. The final choice to capture the sound shows earned agency through accumulated attempts, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("tidal longing," "fog thickened his mind").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is consistent and his "luminous ache" drives clear choices, particularly in solving the clock problem. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("polished obsidian," "silver-streaked") rather than embodied emotion during crisis. The leaf-inspired solution feels earned through established character traits, though internal conflict could be more visceral during the tremor sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's "decisive kindness" manifests through concrete actions (placing her hand without permission, refusing to let sorrow dominate), while Elena's arc from isolation to reunification shows genuine change with visible cost. The vinyl shard functions as both physical object and emotional anchor throughout. However, some therapeutic language ("mending what disease and time had torn apart") and the convenient arrival of the daughter slightly undercut naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her methodical pursuit drives consistent choices, but her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "trembling hands" moment hints at embodied emotion but most interiority remains abstract ("her mind racing to reconnect"). Her final transformation from "budding scholar" to "bearer of awakenings' subtle key" earns its cost through the discovered knowledge but lacks the visceral internal conflict that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's characterization centers on her "forgiving skeptic" nature effectively, with internal contradiction between doubt and belief creating genuine tension. The final choice to forgive and transform loss into acceptance shows earned change with visible emotional cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("mistakes into constellations") rather than embodied emotion, and the changeling child relationship lacks sufficient dramatic weight to fully justify the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to share light without fire is grounded in trauma (the cliff fire) and drives concrete action through sea glass polishing. Internal progression from isolation to connection is earned, though some introspective passages lean toward diagnostic clarity ("to bridge her earthbound gaze to the heavens"). The final choice to share the glass with villagers shows clear agency with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal journey from isolated wound-bearer to connection-seeker is embodied through concrete actions (wandering → approaching → proffering pendant), though some therapy-speak ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") dampens authenticity. The amber pendant's transformation from chain to bridge shows genuine character evolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between completion and fear is established but remains abstract rather than embodied. The cameo figures (Lila, Tomas, Elara) function more as collected visions than pressure points that force concrete choices. The final act of completing the manuscript shows agency, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and her whimsical tinkerer characterization consistent, with concrete details like "fingers dancing like fireflies." However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - she progresses smoothly toward her goal without meaningful struggle or cost until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in grief and manifested through concrete physical endurance against cold, with her methodical alchemy serving as both character trait and dramatic action. The internal contradiction between scientific method and emotional desperation creates authentic tension, though some passages drift toward abstract emotional summary ("geography of grief") rather than fully embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through the discovery of the timer mechanism and his drive to harvest echoes for healing. His reflective nature and locksmith precision create consistent character logic, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("the cellar of reason"). The final understanding of his own reflection as the harvest shows earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to collect burdens and balance her fractal curse is clear and drives meaningful choices. The internal contradiction between entrapment and purpose works well, though her emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract. The transformation of ethereal burdens into stone weights shows concrete micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's grief-processing through crystallized memory fragments shows genuine internal contradiction between holding on and letting go. The widow's "hauntingly practical" approach to loss—harvesting lessons before they scatter—creates embodied tension through the carving blank she grips while memories fracture. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("hollow in her chest") rather than pure embodiment, but the final choice to carve peace into wood demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between eroded ambitions and determination reads authentically through concrete embodiment ("calloused hands gripping the splintered wood"). The ghost negotiation crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hollow ache" and "spectral remnants" that could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "stoic wonder" characterization holds consistently, but internal conflict remains largely cerebral without embodied contradiction. The transformation from observation to action feels earned through accumulated detail, though peak moments lack visceral emotional embodiment beyond "spark of intrigue" and "quiet satisfaction."

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between abandonment and longing is embodied through concrete actions (placing the clock among crystals) with visible cost. However, the transformation relies heavily on abstract "peace settling" rather than dramatized struggle, and some emotional transitions feel unearned through scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to understand deception architecture is consistent and drives his actions through salvaging and diving. However, his internal transformation feels somewhat declared rather than embodied—the final realization about his own self-deceptions arrives through exposition ("errant pursuits masking the lies he'd told himself") rather than dramatized struggle. The character shows competence but limited vulnerability under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving ancient knowledge methods—with concrete embodiment through physical actions (tracing knots, pressing glass to rope). Internal experience reads authentic but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the "infinitely patient" trait manifests but doesn't create visible struggle or cost. The final tears provide embodied emotion, though the transformation feels somewhat unearned without prior internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through obituaries for the living is conceptually intriguing but remains mostly abstract. His choice to stay in the garden rather than board the ship suggests agency, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—we see contemplation without genuine struggle. The connection to Liora provides some grounding, yet their brief harbor meeting doesn't establish sufficient emotional stakes to justify the intimate projection that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elarion's motivation crystallizes clearly—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—and his obsessive hypothesizing reveals character through action. The discovery of the egg creates a meaningful shift from abstract longing to concrete hope with implied cost. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("flawed genesis," "hollow echo of life") rather than embodied emotion, and the character remains somewhat archetypal despite vivid external description.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's arson history, with embodied details like "fingering the black sand" and the scars as "forgotten rivers." The wanderer provides secondary pressure that forces Elara to articulate her philosophy. However, internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the wanderer's transformation feels somewhat abrupt without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss (mother to the fountains), with her "luminous skeptic" nature creating genuine internal tension between doubt and hope. The final choice to apply "sidereal patience" rather than force demonstrates earned character growth. Deduction for some label-speak ("realistically imaginative") and the convenience of the box opening precisely when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent—sharing understanding without destructive passion—and her internal conflict between recognition and inevitability creates authentic tension. The generational pattern of isolation provides strong backstory integration. However, the resolution lacks a decisive cost-bearing choice; she settles among her kin with the cycle unbroken, missing the earned transformation needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's meditative nature manifests through concrete actions (pausing work, retracing paths) with internal contradiction between seeking and fearing grief's shape. The spectral mentorship creates genuine pressure on choices, though Liora's wisdom occasionally veers toward diagnostic clarity. Character change from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated ritual actions, with visible cost in the greenhouse monument.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied guilt through the pendulum pause visions and physical handling of the rake handle. The brother's spectral appearance and Elias's thirty-year penance create genuine internal conflict. Deducted for some abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution," "ethically diligent") that reads more like labels than lived experience, though the final choice to confess carries real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's blithe spirit and methodical puzzle-solving create a consistent character, with his belief that "the dead left puzzles for the living to solve" driving investigation. The final realization about fluid intentions is earned through his discovery process. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction during key moments, relying on gentle curiosity rather than conflicted impulses, and the chess metaphor feels imposed rather than emerging from character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between doubt and determination plays out through concrete actions (chart-making, modeling). However, her characterization relies heavily on conceptual description ("groundedly imaginative," "ignorance cartographer") rather than embodied emotional states, and the piece lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's transformation from passive copyist to active story-guardian is well-motivated through concrete discovery and action. The characterization succeeds through embodied details like "ink-stained fingers" and his secretive radio tuning, though some interior passages drift toward abstraction ("thistled calm deepening") rather than maintaining embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's motivation to crystallize her mother's final embrace drives consistent, embodied choices throughout, with contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) acting simultaneously in the mask-creation scene. The final renunciation of wearing the mask carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("tender illusion of safety") and occasional emotional labeling rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - preserve old methods against "sterile machines and synthetic rites." Internal conflict manifests concretely through his agonizing over the cog ("To share it would arm their new chroniclers...to hide it meant letting the old narratives sink deeper"). The final choice to bury himself with the cog shows earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with his journey from hatred to harmony driving meaningful choices throughout. The students show credible transformation through specific embodied changes ("poet softened her verses," "worker hummed old folk tunes without scorn"). However, the resolution feels slightly rushed—the final harmony arrives too smoothly given the deep-seated hatreds described, and individual character arcs lack the granular complexity that would elevate this to excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his gift of tasting memories provides concrete embodiment, but internal contradiction happens through summary ("bitter arguments...sweet laughter") rather than simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice to plant lacks visible personal cost—he risks little beyond effort. Character-specific perception works well through taste-memory, though some passages drift into diagnostic self-awareness ("quiet defiance against the erasure of heritage").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict as he struggles to preserve wonder while being unable to lie, manifesting in his creative use of riddles and the lacquer box. His motivation is consistent and embodied through specific actions, though the resolution with Lira feels slightly rushed without full exploration of the cost to his belief system.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" drives concrete action through the cottage restoration sequence, with his motivation clearly rooted in observing the bay's "creeping ennui." His transformation from passive observer to "quiet guardianship" is earned through specific choices with the displaced objects. The internal progression feels authentic, though some moments edge toward over-articulation ("inadvertently profound" reads slightly diagnostic).

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's internal conflict between certainty about her artificiality and dawning nuance reads clearly, with embodied reactions like "recoiled inwardly" and "trembling hands." The final choice to thread the foxglove elixir carries visible risk and cost, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("certainty like a shroud") rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's "grim optimist" characterization holds consistently through concrete actions—rolling dice for order, sketching equations, pursuing the missed perpetual motion opportunity. The internal contradiction between calculated risk and yearning for the "texture" of daring drives genuine tension, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing ("balancedly daring defined him") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's methodical hope and insomnia drive consistent action through the piece, with internal conflict between exhaustion and artistic purpose. The final renunciation of insomnia for "saffron quiet peace" arrives through earned causality. However, some interiority relies on abstraction ("methodically hopeful summons") rather than embodied contradiction, and the daydream sequences occasionally tell emotional states rather than showing them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve dying traditions drives clear choices, particularly in the climax where she physically rescues the molds despite danger. Her internal conflict between preservation and the inevitability of loss creates genuine tension. However, the "rosewater dread" remains more stated than embodied, and her emotional progression from curator to active preserver could use sharper intermediate beats.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to defy fate is clear and consistent, driving his counter-clockwise obsession through concrete actions. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("bleak exhilaration," "latent radiance") without sufficient embodied emotion during peak moments. The final beat shows genuine cost in his trembling hands and the world "still shadowed," earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to confront childhood fear is clear and rooted in guilt over her sister's disappearance, with internal conflict between terror and the need to unbosom her secret driving genuine stakes. However, the whispering advisor lacks embodied presence as either psychological fragment or spectral entity, and emotional progression relies on abstract "fear manifesting as shadowy figure" rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward's motivation to transform chaos into harmony drives concrete choices through the storm, with his vow after near-destruction providing clear causality. The character's specialized perception (reading clouds as tidal prophecies) creates distinctive interiority, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("burning deep" motivation). His final choice to dub obstacles into instruments shows agency with visible cost in the storm's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's quietly driven nature manifests through sustained cartographic obsession and her refusal of closure regarding Thorne's fate, with embodied dread ("sweat tracing dread's path down her spine"). The final choice to "crack their vigil" despite knowing the risks shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving meaningful choices throughout, but interiority often relies on abstract reflection ("emotionally rational, always weighing sentiment against evidence") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice to carry "recaptured truth" represents genuine change with visible cost (abandoning the comfort of noble lies), though internal conflict could be more visceral during key discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to become "archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives concrete action through finding the inkwell and embedding notes in repairs. His stoically sensitive nature creates internal contradiction shown through physical work masking emotional response. The transformation from surveyor to something more lands with earned weight, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("interlaced absences") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara shows consistent traits (logical indexer, tranquilly perceptive) that drive her methodical approach. Her internal contradiction between doubt and resolve ("dappled resolve") feels authentic. The final commitment to "readjust the world's understanding" is earned through her discovery process, showing meaningful character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's grief-driven motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (gem polishing, crane folding), though some interior passages lean toward therapy-speak ("grief clawed at his chest like thorns hidden in silk"). The transformation from torment to "fragile peace" feels earned through accumulated ritual actions, with genuine cost shown in his shadow's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his grief-driven obsession compels action, but his internal state relies heavily on abstract concepts ("bleak exhilaration," "cold star") rather than embodied contradiction. The character makes choices under pressure, yet emotional complexity defaults to stated extremes without the simultaneity of conflicting impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "perpetually surprised" trait manifests consistently through embodied perception ("wide eyes reflecting the cosmos"), and her transformation from isolated drone pilot to cosmically connected seeker earns its cost through accumulated discovery. The pilgrim functions more as catalyst than character, limiting relational dynamics, but Elara's internal journey from displacement to belonging lands with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong characterization with clear internal contradiction between protection and deception. Elias's guilt is well-embodied ("guilt gnawed at him, a relentless tide") and his decision to tell the truth feels earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip toward label-speak in places but generally avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between guilt and diplomatic duty drives meaningful choices, particularly his decision to give the drawer pull to Tomas. The characterization relies heavily on reflection rather than embodied emotion in crisis moments. Lira and Tomas remain functional rather than fully realized, though the brother dynamic pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation and internal conflict are clear and embodied through concrete details like the broken compass and specific memories of failed reconciliation. The "merrily melancholic" contradiction plays effectively in his half-laugh, half-sigh response to loss. However, the rushed ending undermines earned closure—Lena's appearance feels convenient rather than causally motivated, and their reconciliation lacks the dramatized cost this arc demands.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation from cynical grifter to empathy-seeker is earned through concrete experience in the labyrinth, with his weeping marking genuine change. However, the clean slate procedure's ambiguous effectiveness weakens initial motivation clarity, and the meta-commentary at the end ("But wait, that's over—recalibrate") breaks character consistency at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to resurrect Thorne drives the transformation, though the reluctance to metamorphosis feels more stated than embodied through concrete resistance. The final wolf transformation and spectral reunion earn the closure, but internal conflict could be more visceral during the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in maternal repentance, with embodied emotion ("tears blurred the visions, each drop a pearl of repentance"). The "willingly perplexed" state creates genuine internal contradiction between surrender and seeking. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle, and some emotional articulation veers toward therapy-speak ("cloudbound repentance she sought, a reckoning suspended").

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's pacifist code drives genuine internal tension through shadow work confronting violent memories, with embodied responses like "recoiled from" and "gravitationally lighter when happy." However, his transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the shadow integration proceeds too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost to his core identity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's philanthropic motivation is clear and consistent, driving meaningful choices like gathering the lightning bugs and releasing them.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's calm inventiveness manifests through concrete actions (tracing wards, decoding the sundial) with clear motivation to spark revolution, though her internal contradictions remain understated. The supporting cast functions collectively rather than as distinct individuals, but their gathering creates sufficient pressure for the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's precognitive curse creates genuine internal tension between seeing futures and living present moments, embodied through her ritual work with star dust and painted rocks. The final choice to step into the aurora carries weight, though some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to chart his scars and break censorship drives concrete action (descending with the envelope), with internal contradiction between furious emotion and tranquil resolve embodied throughout. The transformation from vigil to action shows earned change with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract interiority ("cartography of scars") and occasional diagnostic phrasing ("furiously tranquil" used as self-aware label).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" drives consistent choices, and his diplomatically fierce nature manifests through both physical practice and verbal fencing. The mechanical arm detail adds specificity without becoming ornamental. However, the rival remains underdeveloped as mere opposition, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("dignified chaos") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal complexity, particularly his shift from "quiet archivist" to "bold visionary," with the coffee tin secret providing concrete embodiment of his vagrant past. Marcus functions well as pressure point, though his transformation lacks the nuanced cost visible in Elias's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation through "steely longing" and grief over lost love drives consistent choices, with strategically creative problem-solving shown through his repurposing of found objects into a makeshift projector. The final choice to play defiantly lacks sufficient internal contradiction or embodied struggle in the moment of decision, reading more as predetermined than wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to protect collective memory drives consistent choices through seed-planting, dream interpretation, and ritual leadership. The "luminous doubt" creates genuine internal tension, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("empirically whimsical" feels more conceptual than embodied). Her final smile and internalized seed legacy shows earned change with visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's grief and guilt drive coherent motivation through concrete details like pruning the bonsai and interpreting the lace, with his unspoken apology to Mira creating genuine internal conflict. The final act of weaving pine into lace shows meaningful change through acceptance. However, Mira remains more concept than character, and some emotional articulation ("cerulean regret," "wounds reopening") tends toward label-speak rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, with concrete interiority and a credible, earned shift from artist to fugitive.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with his trauma from the capsize and his motivation to translate silence into music driving his choices.

    Elias's introverted nature and motivation are consistently dramatized through embodied actions like trembling hands and kneeling.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear, rooted in specific traits, and intensifies under pressure. His "neatly inventive" nature is shown through his tools and method, and his final choice to defy fate is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to confront fear is clear and rooted in childhood guilt, with embodied emotions and earned change through confession.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward's motivation is clear and rooted in his past trauma, compelling his high-stakes choice to confront the storm. His internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception ("his weathered robes whispering," "eyes, sharp as barnacle hooks").

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's quietly driven nature is embodied through concrete actions like tracing shell patterns and her refusal to accept closure. Her motivation intensifies believably under pressure, culminating in a credible, grief-laced resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a coherent, well-motivated character whose internal contradiction ("stoically sensitive") is dramatized through his physical labor and emotional response to the inkwell. His final choice to embed the notes is earned by his established motivation and the object's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her lineage, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "tranquilly perceptive" nature is embodied in her calm navigation and micro-choices, like tracing the stamp's edges.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's grief is concretely embodied and motivates consistent micro-choices, such as polishing the amethyst and folding cranes, with the final release earned by prior causality.

    Elara's motivation to "decode the frequency of belonging" is a clear, high-stakes driver that compels her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's guilt is concretely embodied through tactile details like "hands trembling," and his internal conflict between protection and truth drives a credible micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete interiority showing reluctance and internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in specific past defiance and present maternal urgency. Interiority is concrete and embodied (trembling fingers, tears blurring visions), and her final renunciation of perplexity for revelation is earned by the ritual's causality. The trait "willingly perplexed" is slightly more told than shown in its initial presentation, but it is dramatized through her surrender to the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's pacifism is concretely embodied through actions like "patient reconfiguration" and recoiling from violent memories. His motivation is clear and consistent, driving his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)

Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. determination) act in scene, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his identity as a silenced artist.

    Elias's characterization is strong, with his molting personality and ink-stained fingers providing concrete, embodied details.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and flaws are clear and embodied—her shift from spectacle to patient attention is dramatized through concrete choices (netting butterflies, brushing dust, reworking data). The renunciation at the end feels earned and costly in identity terms. Internal conflict could tighten further; resistance to her new method is largely inferred rather than tested. Still, the arc from sensationalist to humble observer is credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and tactics are clear and rooted in her artist’s sensibility, with embodied beats (trembling by the fire, reading frost) revealing her under pressure. “Steadily adaptive” is shown in action rather than just told. The internal conflict is mild; she pivots to purpose with limited friction or contradictory impulse. The ending stance feels earned but the felt cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s goal is clear and embodied through tactile choices (carrying the tuning fork case through the wreck; initiating the scan despite trauma). His interiority leans summary-lyric rather than conflicted beat-by-beat struggle, but the bodily cues (frostbite, sweat under the scan) ground it. The relationship with Lira adds gentle pressure and enables a cooperative arc. The resolution tilts tidy—his transformation faces little friction—but it reads earned within the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, character-driven motive (to “give rest a permanent address”) collides with his compulsion to answer the lens’s pleas, producing credible conflict. Interiority is embodied—ache, blood, weariness—and choices under pressure (cutting his palm, staying in the impossible space) reveal values. The stubbornness reads as flaw and engine. A slight limit: no interpersonal crucible to test him further.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (braiding elders and youth) is clear and drives her culminating choice to formalize the runs. Her “gently persistent” mode is embodied (murmured guidance, soft bell) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is limited—she never wavers or pays an explicit personal cost—so the arc feels steady more than pressure-bent. The youth runner adds a relational beat but does not alter Elara’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (find where unused love is stored; heal the former-brother) is clear and consistent, and her choices—kneeling, setting up the obscura, using Kwan Yin’s tear, mirroring breath—track with that drive. The moment of doubt (“if he was real or a projection”) adds a welcome internal countercurrent. The relationship crucible (past-life sibling) is evocative but could press harder on present-tense friction. The cost to her is largely conceptual; a more felt price would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s vocation and childhood wound (fading photographs) give him a specific drive that coheres with his methods and choices. The internal tension—urge to impose order vs. surrender to reverie—surfaces credibly at the decision to disintegrate the fragment. Embodied perception (callused hands, garden’s pulse) grounds emotion. The “incantations” arrive a touch conveniently, but the choice still reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation and agency-driven micro-choices (feigned surrender, throwing the arrow, scattering keys) under pressure. Interiority is largely externalized through action and image, with limited contradictory impulses or deep interior conflict. The “patient, strategic” trait is shown rather than told, but the psyche remains sketched rather than fully embodied. The final renunciation of safety for planting reads earned, if emotionally restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and specific—forge a device to capture the sound of trust breaking—and her actions (collecting absences, operating the forge, imprinting) align under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied via synesthetic perception and workmanlike detail. The internal contradiction (wound fueling the craft that might heal it) is present but articulated a touch directly at the end. The bracketed meta intrusions dilute the felt cost and slightly safety-net the emotional messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—stealing illuminated moments to unlock destiny—reads clear and consistent, with tactile micro-choices (feigning interest in a timetable, decoding floriography). Interiority is vivid and character-specific, not generic. However, internal contradiction is light; she moves from desire to action with little genuine friction or cost. The identity shift to “guardian” is earned but could carry more on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—building “safe zones for inquiry”—is clear, rooted in loss, and expressed through tangible actions (blowing orbs, packing the forge). His inner shift from clinging to the ruin to abandoning it tracks credibly with the environment’s mounting threat. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The bookmark memory personalizes his drive and nudges the decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear: fear-fueled instincts vs. the need to act, culminating in a credible choice to expose Marcus. Embodied details (trembling hands, claustrophobia flares) ground her interiority under pressure. The mentor-student dynamic provides a crucible for status reversal. Minor dock for occasional thesis-like self-declarations that pre-empt subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—mapping the endless night—drives every choice, from traveling to the fort to choosing mental inscription over risking the fragile booklet. Interiority is specific and filtered through her tactile, sound-attentive perception. However, we get little true contradiction or costed trade-off beyond patience vs fragility; the “mild obsession” rarely produces friction. The resulting arc reads as a steady commitment rather than a contested one.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity-driven motive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (lifting, playing, then setting down the violin; resuming the sweep) align with her composed nature. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—duty versus metaphysical inquiry—more contemplative than pressured. The final Earned Stasis (continuing to sweep, now reweighted) feels earned, though the on-page cost is quiet. Interiority is distinct and embodied through sensor-language rather than therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s desire to move from neutrality to vulnerability is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (eavesdropping, stepping forward, drawing) align with that drive. The internal conflict—duty-bound registrar vs. human need to connect—registers on the page without therapy-speak. The cost of breaking his oath and exposing his past is felt, though the turn is a touch tidy via the conveniently “warm” lens. Strong, specific interiority sustains the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—prove the garden knows him—remains clear and coherent, and his rituals (selecting/polishing marbles) reveal character through action. Interiority is mostly summary and steady-state, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The closing shift (“renewed vigor” and repriced faith over luck) lands but with modest felt cost. Relationship crucibles are absent, so pressure stays primarily internal and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clear, consistent motives for Elara and Jax, with concrete occupational behaviors, but limited interior contradiction and little visible cost at the end. Jax’s obliging nature and voice modulator texture help distinction, yet their emotional stakes remain mostly asserted. Micro-choices (syncing, engaging, tethering) align with motives but don’t force a sacrifice. Relationship pressure is minimal; they collaborate smoothly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to decode Isabella’s message—is clear, persistent, and enacted through concrete choices (lingering, handling the program, playing to breach the veil). Interiority feels embodied and character-specific (musician’s attention to “hush of unstruck chords,” bow tracing symbols). The internal tension (reverence for the hush vs. urge to disrupt) is present but not deeply contradictory. His final shift from mystery-chasing to resolution lands credibly with the loss of the program.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to face the “swallowed truth” about leaving—reads clear and specific, and Mira applies credible pressure that reveals Elara’s hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied (cold glass, smudged paper) and contradictory (solace in isolation vs. fear of being “claimed” by the mountain). The final choice to descend is earned by prior beats (Mira’s smudge method) with a felt, if quiet, cost. Minor drawback: some thematic exposition edges toward telling what the characters mean.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s reckless curiosity, skepticism, and buried guilt read as coherent and character-specific, and his micro-choices (pocketing the valve, pressing deeper, interpreting the radio) reveal him under pressure. The apparition’s confession catalyzes a credible internal turn that lines up with his established flaw. Contradictory impulses (thrill vs guilt; drowsy yet alert) are dramatized rather than labeled. The confession does arrive a touch conveniently, softening the felt need for a harder on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is crystalline—witness change without judgment—and his choices (unfolding/refolding, leaving, ritualizing the burrowing) align. Interiority is textured through tactile detail, though internal contradiction is minimal, limiting complexity. The cost of leaving the collapsing library and bodily effort registers but stays muted. A richer friction between detachment and desire would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motive—nurturing wonder in Theo—drives concrete choices (music, stories, relinquishing the curl). Her “cautious exuberance” reads as a live contradiction that textures her tenderness with risk. Theo’s guardedness softens into participation, giving the relationship a credible arc. The only limit is that conflict remains gentle, with little errant behavior or sharp internal sabotage on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elowen’s motive—collecting “the stories walls have heard”—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile, embodied choices. Her interiority feels particular (ear to plaster, tracing mortar) rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little counterforce beyond atmosphere, so the final stance carries limited cost. The closing renunciation (“not to restore the world, but to dream anew”) is conceptually earned but lightly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (to “transpose” his life) drives concrete choices (using microdots, distributing cookies, handing one to Maris). Interiority is specific and embodied (salt, fog, chill), with a flicker of contradictory impulse when the prophetic echo chills him. Relationship pressure with Maris is light but functional. The cost is mostly anticipatory rather than felt, limiting depth at the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Father Elias’s motive and method are clear and coherent, and his past as a wandering musician adds specificity that informs his tactics. Embodied stress appears (sweat, fatigue, time pressure), and his micro-choices (pedal layering vs. painting fissures) align with his values. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or miscalculates, which limits complexity. The cost feels more exertional than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear motive (reclaiming lost time/art) drives concrete micro-choices: mapping memories onto the shell, pushing through exhaustion, rising with the talisman at dawn. Interiority is specific and embodied (scent of dough, fireflies’ chatter), not generic labels. The internal tension—homesickness for linear time vs. compulsion to orchestrate the non-linear—is credible. The final stance (claiming the conductor role) feels earned, though cost remains more atmospheric than materially priced.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is explicit and coherent (“to conquer the labyrinth of self”) and actions align: entering at the liminal moment, retracing, confronting the shadow-self. Interior contradiction appears but remains abstract; her fear vs. defiance is told more than dramatized. The pivotal choice—rejecting the solitude-born doppelganger—reads, but the emotional cost is lightly felt. Strong sensory embodiment at the outset gives way to conceptual language at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—piercing numbness through vibration—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (repairing the phonograph, playing the cylinder in reverse). Interiority is specific (callused hands, stone-borne tremors) and avoids diagnostic language. The shift from detachment to tears reads earned, though the resolution trends a touch tidy. Lack of an on-page foil limits relational pressure but fits the single-POV design.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s meticulousness and credible curiosity drive concrete micro-choices (lingering in the courtyard, coaxing the pigeon, choosing lateral dissemination). The internal tension between fear (being followed) and method (observation over confrontation) is present but relatively low-stakes on the page. His renunciation—avoiding direct conflict to preserve integrity—feels earned. Costs remain mostly implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motive (to probe olfactory grief) is clear, his caution credibly contradicts his compulsion, and his choice to uncork despite fear earns the final release. Interiority is embodied via scent, tools, and memory rather than labels. The grief turn lands as a lived cost. The single slip is a slightly tidy epiphany phrased abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—Elias seeks “the texture of time”—and his ethically playful streak surfaces under pressure. Contradictory impulses (freedom vs. binding himself as “eternal poet”) are live in-scene, not just summarized. His actions (uncoiling the rope, tracing, uncovering layers, finally letting the rope fall) align with interior stakes. Slight abstraction in emotive phrasing keeps embodiment just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—finding beauty in the unfinished—is clear and embodied through specific acts (playing, flipping and filling the bowl, passing it). His acoustic sensitivity filters perception in character-particular ways. Internal conflict is more implied than pressured; we don’t see a hard trade-off or a visible price beyond sustained grief. Still, his micro-choices guide the circle’s release and feel credible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive to fuse insight with feeling is clear and particular, filtered through her tactile “static” sense. The internal contradiction—affectionate detachment vs. longing for empathy—animates the scene and culminates in a credible shift. The bodily markers (prickle, breath, scent) keep emotions embodied. The cost of losing detachment is felt but understated, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, specific motivation (uplifting “silent contributors”) drives Elias’s choices and aligns with his occupational texture; Mira reads as a credible counterpart with lived stakes. Interiority is present but light under pressure—few contradictory impulses or costly trade-offs on the page. The partnership decision is earned but largely frictionless, limiting depth. Dialogue beats reflect status and intent naturally but don’t test the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s desire to belong drives clear, motivated choices (propose the search, insist on the descent, then dedicate the arbor). Interiority is textured through craft and ache, though contradictions remain gentle rather than pressurized. Lir’s hesitation vs. trust provides a credible relational crucible. The final integration feels earned, if emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (to find the birthplace of echoes) is clear and drives tangible choices—docking, climbing, invoking the pendant, diving. Interiority is present but largely functional; contradictory impulses surface late (ambition vs. time-debt) and aren’t deeply dramatized. She faces little resistance and reads highly competent, reducing felt struggle. The final realization that the pendant binds her provides a credible cost but arrives after a relatively smooth success run.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s motivation—quantifying grief born of ambiguous loss—is clear and consistently drives her gentle, coaxing approach to magic. Interiority is specific (her tactile attention to bark, stone, and eyes) and reveals a credible, tender temperament. The change at the end (reframing loss as an integral term rather than subtraction) feels earned by the ritual. Slight limitation: contradictions under pressure are soft; she rarely strains against herself beyond elegiac restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s drive to be seen is specific, credible, and grows from tactile work in the crawl spaces to a risky emergence. Interiority is filtered through concrete sense memories (tape scent, attic studio), avoiding stock affect. The internal contradiction—comfort in obscurity vs. urge to console—is present and resolved with a visible cost. Relationship pressure with the young woman is brief but reconfigures his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to study plant behaviors) and flaw (control masked as care) are clear and drive the choice to surrender. Embodied conflict—fear and desire—surfaces in tactile beats (leaf warmth, veins tingling). The renunciation of control reads as an earned shift with cost to identity. Depth is strong though largely internal, with limited secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s insomnia-driven search for meaning motivates concrete choices—following rain trails, kneeling at the fissure, offering the brooch. Interiority is textured and embodied (“salt,” “metallic tang”), and Mira functions as a credible foil with distinct voice. The final shift (valuing exchange over solitude) is earned but a touch tidy. Cost is present (relinquishing the brooch, vulnerability), if modest.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core drive (to magnify everyday magic) is clear and propulsive, and her arrogance/overreliance on visions primes the fall. Interiority is sensorially embodied (cool pearl, thickened air) with a credible moment of unease before the reach. Agency compresses into a single consequential choice (taking the pearl), after which she’s largely overpowered. The loss of self at the end reads as a paid cost, though micro-choices under peak pressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character-particular—returning as a guardian of shards to mend communal absences—and her actions align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through sensory cues and object handling (the valve, bone maps), but contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal. The community’s wary gaze provides faint counterpressure without deep interpersonal crucible on the page. The final choice—to hearten through the valve’s hum—feels earned, if the emotional cost remains subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (unraveling her family’s lies) is clear and consistently drives her choices from following the crack-arrows to punching the ticket and boarding. The “analytically artistic” lens personalizes perception and action (decoding fissures, using the sigil sketch as a ticket). Fear versus resolve is legible in “trembling certainty,” offering mild internal contradiction without melodrama. The final choice feels earned, though the cost is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance credibly drives her choice to help and to transcribe, and Lir’s grief is embodied enough to matter. The kindness-vs-skepticism contradiction plays on the page and results in a believable softening. Emotional texture leans summary at times, but key actions align with motives. The final repricing of Elara’s stance feels earned without false neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s ennui-to-intrigue arc is clear and credible, with concrete micro-choices (lifting the shard, “guiding the spatial mutiny,” enduring the burn). Contradictory impulses are present (weariness vs. risk), though the internal conflict remains relatively low-friction. Embodied emotion shows in tactile detail, not therapy-speak. The final stance shift is earned, if modest in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s drive is precise and embodied—an “honest child” using learned illicit skills under pressure. Her contradictory impulses (integrity vs. theft) surface in the waiting/breach beats and land credibly at the letter. A deeper dramatized cost or moment of hesitation beyond competence would have enriched the crucible. Still, actions consistently spring from motive and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he collects “textures of different times” to resist erasure—and actions align (flees to bonsai archive, charts the hum, writes). Interiority is concrete via tactile obsessions and process. The main limitation is a narrow conflict profile: few contradictory impulses or tough trade-offs on the page until the ending choice to descend. The restraint moment when he halts in the shifting paths hints at a richer inner tension that could be pressed harder.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—an erased person collecting textures of memory—but internal conflict remains understated, with the wanderer largely observing rather than confronting a charged choice. Micro-choices (venturing deeper, climbing to a perch, clutching the label) reveal character but rarely force trade-offs. The mirroring of the death-certificate error with the migrant manifest is incisive and deepens interiority. The earned endurance at the end reads as a quiet acceptance rather than a hard renunciation with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s skepticism versus felt pull toward the unknown creates credible tension, with micro-choices (pocketing the shell, bowing the cello, staying to listen) revealing him under pressure. Interiority is specific (“gloomy cheer,” the shell’s heartbeat warmth) and avoids therapy-speak. The change—reframing myth-busting as mending—lands, though the cost is more implied than viscerally dramatized. A slightly sharper moment of resistance would deepen the earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motives are clear and consistent, and her dual allegiance yields credible choices (quiet planning, encoded graffiti, defensive perimeter). Interiority is present but largely summarized rather than embodied in moment-to-moment micro-choices, limiting lived emotional texture. The juggler scene hints at her shock-absorbing trait in action but is brief. The final choice—pushing incorporation—feels earned by prior moves, though costs are more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clean and consistent—preserve the “dawning hush”—and her micro-choices (pocketing the grain, setting the chem-lab, enduring the vigil) align. Interiority is specific (moon’s “silvery melancholy”) and embodied through suit ticks and cold, though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. The endurance-as-cost is credible but low-risk on the page. A sharper internal conflict or visible hazard would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation and competence are vividly rendered and drive every choice, particularly the tactile diagnosis via refracted warmth. Interiority is concrete without therapy-speak, though internal contradiction is minimal (he rarely falters or doubts). Apprentices add light relational texture without pressure. The final release of the drone aligns with his values and feels earned, if low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive (to find river sources) is clear and particular to his profession; his dry wit and precision color every choice. The internal rub—subtle doubt flickering against quiet confidence—surfaces credibly just before he departs. Micro-choices (studying condensation, cross-referencing the phrasebook, deciding to leave) align with motive. The cost is modest but present: he foregoes safety for a perilous pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motivation to restore “shared balance” is clear and consistent, and her actions (striking and adjusting the fork, speaking riddles) align with it. Interiority remains mostly emblematic rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The brief interaction with Thorne adds a glint of social dynamic but not a crucible. The endurance choice reads credible but low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive—to “harness the ephemeral”—is clear and credibly intertwined with survival, and her panic-versus-surrender conflict manifests in concrete micro-choices (uncorking the vial, then methodically unsnarling). The childhood net memory functions as more than exposition, directly informing her tactic. Embodied cues (oxygen alarms, tears, heaviness of breath) keep interiority grounded. The arc lands slightly tidy, but the cost of time and exposure to painful memory keeps it honest.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (to rewrite his inheritance; “chasing hush”) drives tactile choices (rowing out, reading scuffs, entering, confessing). Interiority is textured and embodied, though contradictory impulses (loyalty vs repudiation of the father) are more implied than staged. The cost is felt but quiet—no decisive external test—keeping the arc credible but modest. The door “swinging wider” signals earned lightening, not an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s remorse-driven motive is clear and coherently escalates from denial to active experimentation to surrender. His contradiction—seeking control through alchemy while being drawn by regret—is present on the page. The final choice to “ghost into her world” is earned and costly. Some interiority leans on telling (“ultimate betrayal”) rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and coherent, and her actions (the trance walk and sewing) align with her “hauntingly optimistic” drive. Interiority is present but light on contradiction; she rarely struggles or doubts, which trims dramatic complexity. The most revealing choice—making the sewn paths communal—lands, but without a visible personal cost. Still, the specificity of her craft and ritual gives her texture beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (to restore faith) drives embodied choices (digging, mapping, rebuilding). Interiority feels particular—longing and trepidation coexist—though contradictions rarely pinch into sharply conflicted in-scene choices. The visible cost is primarily labor and persistence rather than a fraught renunciation. The final renewal reads earned by accumulated work rather than sudden declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—finding meaning in margins—drives concrete choices (surface mail, chalk codes) and coheres with his trade. Interiority is specific and embodied (chalk-dusted fingers, clipboard as talisman). However, internal contradiction under pressure is mild; he rarely faces a live counter-pull beyond wistful nostalgia. The final stance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and tactic (disguised foolishness) are clear and enacted in micro-choices like the silly rhyme to misdirect the guard and the precise synchronization act. Interiority is grounded in tactile craft (needle, hoop, breath) rather than labels. Internal contradiction (fear vs. mission) is present but not deeply dramatized in a single pressured moment. The closing choice (to slip evidence) is credible yet its cost is mostly implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—reclaiming the apology withheld from her sister—drives concrete actions and a credible inner conflict between pride and tenderness. Embodied beats (bare feet in muck, pressing shard to glass) keep emotions grounded. A few abstract turns (“cryptic nature unraveling”) skim the surface, but the final renunciation reads earned. The emotional cost lands in the tear-misted window and release of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—bridging divides through language—drives concrete micro-choices (wiping the cast, decrypting, transcribing). Interiority is specific and embodied, with the coral talisman revealing worldview. The conflict remains mostly internal with limited contradictory impulses or cost. Still, the final resolve feels earned from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (recover the lost joy of creation) and actions align: he explores, studies the fragment, engages the “knowledge network,” and paints with light. Interiority is specific to an artist’s eye and craft. Internal contradiction is mild (weariness vs curiosity), so pressure never fully tests him. The ending shift to renewal feels earned, albeit with little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to trade Elias’s certainty for curiosity—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (coin, posture, whistle). Relationship dynamics (scholar vs. restorer) are legible and shift when his “notebook [is] forgotten.” Internal contradiction is limited; Elara remains serenely competent with little risk of failure. Elias’s change is embodied (chest vibration, widened eyes) and credible within the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive (guard the “untaxed spark”) is clear and consistently pursued through planting, warping, and deflecting the drone. His charm surfaces in action and brief dialogue, but internal contradiction is minimal—he rarely wavers or pays a personalized cost beyond ambient risk. Secondary characters apply mild pressure rather than forcing hard choices. The final commitment reads earned but emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (to transmute pain into beauty) is vivid and consistent, with embodied choices—rising, singing, placing the postcard—under pressure. Contradictory currents (insomnia-fatigue vs. shy resolve; “doubt shadowed her steps”) act in-scene. Emotional texture is concrete and character-specific, not therapy-speak. The final endurance—accepting a softened, not cured, insomnia—feels earned with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motive—preserving forgotten names—is clear and embodied through tactile, expert actions. The gently systematic trait informs her choices (song-based mending, lighting the bead), and her regret vs. duty tension reads as an earned endurance. However, contradictory impulses don’t escalate much beyond a steady ache, limiting dynamism. The final stance (persist despite loss) is credible and paid for but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” drive reads specific and embodied in her choice to invoke risky Eldari promises, with Thorne’s guarded stance providing credible counter-pressure. Their shared history surfaces in on-page micro-choices (the listening vow; continuing the glyphs) rather than summary alone. The reconciliation lands, but the emotional cost feels slightly smoothed over, with little lingering mess or consequence. Strong relationship crucible; a touch too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—reconciling engineering rigor with mercy—is clean, embodied through tactile choices (unspooling the chain, pocketing the envelope, running the analysis). Interiority is specific to a seasoned machinist; the chain and spectrometer reveal character under pressure. The change at the end is earned, though the felt cost of renunciation remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives—guarding the echoes of lost songs while fearing betrayal—are concrete and consistent, expressed through tactile rituals (dust-mote mapping, the meteorite as counterweight). Internal contradiction is active: he forges paper selves yet craves authenticity. The choice to share true songs with Mira is earned and carries visible risk. Minor limitation: emotions are mostly mediated by objects, with few visceral bodily beats under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character-particular (sacred thresholds, returning after the butterfly effect) and her micro-choices (studying the grain, arranging prisms, whispering codes) align with that drive. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors devotional focus over contested impulses, so cost and struggle feel muted. Embodied perception via wood veins and prisms grounds her interiority. The closing action is earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her choices (modifying the scanner, aligning the feather, extending it to Lir) track with a distinct worldview. The relationship with Lir registers as a gentle crucible that reveals mutual loneliness without melodrama. Internal contradiction is modest—yearning vs. caution—rather than deeply dramatized under pressure. The closing shift (finding the “rhythm of belonging”) is earned, if slightly low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (“before memory fades… uncover why some paths disappear”) is specific and sustained, and her micro-choices (pressing the seed to the glass, planting the rest) arise from that need. The cheerful gloom gives her a credible contradiction—tender wonder alongside loss—felt in embodied images (sea-foam recollections, vines forming archways). The cost is acceptance of withered paths and continued vigil, not escape. A few aphoristic moments verge on tidy insight, slightly softening the messiness of her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias wants to rewire monotony—but he faces little resistance and shows minimal internal contradiction. Interiority is present (“analytical mind,” “lightly attentive”) yet stays descriptive rather than dramatized under pressure. Secondary figures (young woman, fisherman) are catalytic but thin, offering scant crucible. The final renunciation/shift is modest: satisfaction achieved without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—defying the nostalgia ban by inscribing a cosmic verse—is clear and consistent, and her tide-dancer competence directs concrete choices (mixing ink, etching lines, circling the pond). The “spontaneously anchored” gift/curse adds texture but rarely forces a hard trade-off beyond stabilizing her. Embodied emotion appears (pain “like a dark rose”) but internal contradiction is muted; she rarely wavers. The closing shift from exile to liberation feels earned though the cost remains mostly aesthetic/pain-based, not ethically or socially tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation and longing are specific and credible, and his pebble-toss/reading ritual shows character through action. His motivation—to exalt the mundane—tracks cleanly to his small repair at the end. Internal contradiction (regret vs. harmony in his craft) is present but soft, with limited on-page cost. The change feels earned but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias reads specific and credible: scarred firefighter, hardened yet gentle, with a clear desire to translate pain. His micro-choices (taking the box out, opening it, offering it to Lena, deciding to speak) align with those traits. Internal contradiction (toughness vs tenderness) is present but never truly tested by counterpressure from Lena, so the change costs little. Still, the embodied details (hands, scars, the box) ground his motives effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her handling of the father’s gauge grounds her interiority. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely feels pulled between impulses beyond steady resolve. Micro-choices (shell placement, trial balloons) reveal values but carry little felt cost. The closing shift to “revitalized worlds” reads earned but emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive (to hear “what walls dream”) is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices—following the hum, kneeling to extract diaries, reading, then pocketing the negative—align with that drive. The internal turn from curiosity to accepting atonement reads earned via Harlan’s diaries. Emotional texture is embodied (“damp air clinging… like regret”) rather than labeled. The cost is quieter—taking on legacy’s burden—but present and credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear (save the twin’s essence) and actions flow from it (songs, touch, renunciation). Interiority is consistent and embodied via the “borrowed heartbeat.” Internal tension (elusiveness vs. desire to fix possibility) is present but remains soft, with little on-page counterpressure beyond time. The final acceptance of impermanence reads earned though low on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and stakes are clear and embodied (the clipboard, the ritual herbs), and her renunciation at the end reads as a credible cost. Internal contradiction (devoting life to peace vs. losing identity when peace arrives) is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized. Thorne and Mira function but remain thin, yielding quickly. A touch more friction in their resistance would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—amoral control vs. buried sentiment—are dramatized in the on-page choice to shatter the egg despite reputational risk. Interiority is specific and embodied (the egg’s warmth, ozone, the yielding crust) rather than abstract. A touch of overt exposition (“His philanthropy had always been a mask for control”) flattens nuance slightly, but the final renunciation reads earned. The cost—surrendering the trophy and inviting potential scrutiny—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions (untangling, unlocking, harvesting) align with it. However, internal contradiction is underplayed—she remains serenely assured with little felt friction between fear and resolve. The “chaste” attribute adds a functional filter (attunement to echoes) but doesn’t complicate a choice on the page. Strong embodiment in gestures, limited micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific interiority with credible contradiction: an urbane, “uncommonly serene” artist whose serenity cracks under ethical pressure. The talismanic handling of the story stick and the puppet-show past reveal character via choices, not labels. The reversal is motivated by a concrete epiphany (“the puppets had reversed agency”), not convenience. Slight neatness in the final resolve trims ambiguity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—drives concrete choices (gathering reeds, knotting, building signals), and her realist/mystic tension reads character-specific. Interiority is mostly embodied through tactile action rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict is present but subtle; a sharper live contradiction under the gust’s pressure could deepen it. The final endurance—accepting unresolved loss—feels earned and costs her a completed structure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving ancestral names after self-forgiveness—is clear and drives each micro-choice at the altar. Interiority is concrete (craft habits, sweat, trembling) but internal contradiction is largely pre-resolved, so on-page tension feels gentler than it could. The professional specificity (lost-wax instincts guiding rope work) individualizes her. The final endurance/repair is earned, though the cost remains primarily emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to understand why paths choose walkers) is clear and consistent, and her ritual choice under the storm’s pressure aligns with it. Interiority is textured and embodied (damp earth, rust, the seal’s cool touch). The turn from “curse” to “mirror” is earned through the dream, though the epiphany edges toward tidy. Limited contradiction under pressure (fear vs drive) keeps this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s motive—precision over opulence, devotion to the unknown—drives his choice to use the tile and seal a covenant, but his inner conflict is minimal and largely untested. We rarely see contradictory impulses in scene; he moves cleanly from discovery to vow. Embodied detail (threadbare robes, trembling hands) helps, yet the emotional cost remains abstract. The final renunciation/commitment feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifist cunning is clear and enacted through specific choices (the music box, the sanctuary’s silence). Thorne’s resentment is embodied and credibly melts via the cellular-memory beat, though his inner contradiction is brief on the page. The status dynamic—her calm, his storm—shifts legibly at the handoff and return of the box. Emotional cost is present but modest, mostly tears and relinquishment rather than a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, character-specific motivation (a pragmatic artisan compelled by a fugitive dream) and credible micro-choices (arranging shards, breath-work, angling light). The inner contradiction—firmly grounded vs. yearning for the infinite—is dramatized rather than told. Emotional cost is implied more than felt; he achieves synthesis without a sharply priced sacrifice. Still, interiority feels lived-in and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s stubborn, endearing feistiness and craftsman’s pride clearly motivate his refusal to descend and his improvisation with the ribbon. Interiority is specific (the satchel, herbs, whetstone, ribbon) and tied to choices under pressure. The quiet cost—age, ache, and the absence of Mira—registers without sentimentality. Internal contradiction (resentment at decay vs. love-driven repair) works, though the conflict remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation—pursuing forbidden knowledge despite the risk of madness—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (taking the cameo, locking herself in the bathroom, pressing it to her forehead, renouncing mere cataloging) align. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal, though moments lean abstract (“blankness was its message”). The internal conflict (enlightenment vs entrapment) is credible but lightly embodied. The final stance reads earned, with a felt cost implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her choices (researching etymology, using the fern, confronting the guardian) align with her arcane-linguist identity. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotional texture are light; she rarely hesitates or reveals costs beyond resolve. The relationship with the guardian is functional rather than a crucible with shifting status. The final choice lands but with minimal visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive (recovering Lira’s essence via the garden) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—entering the big top, speaking threads, moving to the engine room, and vowing—track to pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied (“emerald swatch card” as tactile anchor), with credible contradiction (hope versus erasure). Some emotion stays abstract (“unkindled solace”) rather than dramatized through a concrete price, tempering impact. The final vow reads earned but its cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and competencies are distinct and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. Interiority is grounded in tactile detail (callused fingers, methodical handling) rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses or visible internal cost are minimal, making her path feel low-friction. The earned change reads as competence fulfilling purpose more than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive to “find the quiet in the storm” is clear and governs her actions, and her occupational specificity (mapkeeper reading ripples and cracks) individualizes her. Interiority is present but largely single-impulse; there’s little contradictory pressure beyond endurance. Micro-choices (seeking the ice veins, aligning cracks, pressing the stone) align with motive. The emotional cost feels more inferred than dramatized, limiting depth at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—drives consistent choices from scavenging shards to aligning the prism. Her doubt vs. devotion dynamic is clear, with embodied touches (callused hands, shard’s hush) anchoring feeling. However, many key beats are summarized, limiting on-page micro-choices under pressure. The final choice reads earned but its cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation and drive are clear and particular, and her methodical measuring under pressure reveals character. Internal tension—preemptive nostalgia vs. duty—registers, though it rarely forces a painful trade-off on the page. Micro-choices (aligning shadows, declaring “unprecedented reach,” vowing to reweave) feel motivated. The cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, coherent motive (defy despair through creation) is embodied in tactile choices—the rag, the fountain, the fuses—and the doubt/resolve tension gives him dimension. Interiority stays specific to a professional’s sensorium (“ambient awareness,” reading air/light). However, the visible cost of his choice is slight; the success arrives without friction or sacrifice beyond risk. A stronger on-page price at ignition would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are clear and enacted through concrete choices (placing the cicada, holding the pause, speaking). Thorne functions more as pressure than agent, but his unease and “unchosen paths” give the scene human friction. Internal contradiction is mild—Elara is steady rather than torn—so the emotional cost reads more empathic than conflicted. The small renunciation (resisting blunt divination, embracing indirection) feels character-true and earns the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s fear of confinement versus her hunger to “collect the flavors of different silences” generates a credible, particular interior conflict. Her micro-choices under time pressure (limiting exposure, darting between sprouts, clutching the doll) align with that motive. The father’s presence adds relational pressure but remains soft, limiting rupture or cost. The final stance—“To stretch the silences”—reads earned, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (muffling hums, releasing the vial’s mist). Lira’s grief shades the interaction but remains light-touch. Interiority is restrained and specific, though internal contradiction is minimal and the cost to Elias is mostly vigilance rather than a felt sacrifice. The relationship shifts credibly toward solace by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation (to bridge eras via the throne) is clear and consistent, and her choices (sneaking into the undergrid, using the ruby, ascending) align. Internal contradiction is limited; “wisely adventurous” rarely costs her anything on the page. Emotional texture leans label-y and idealized at peak beats. The culminating acceptance feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—burning ties to force self-sufficiency—feels specific and consistent, and her micro-choices with the ring track to that ethic. However, contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page; she does not waver meaningfully once the encroachment begins. The emotional cost of her method is articulated but more told than embodied in a hard choice. Still, the surgeon-like severance and scars-as-map reveal a distinct, coherent character.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and character-rooted: a survivor’s skepticism matched with a mischievous altruism. Her micro-choices (opening the panel, unseating the bolt, choosing to “volunteer fully”) align with those traits. Internal contradiction appears but lightly—she questions the promise yet leans in quickly. The change to “weaver of wonders” feels earned though the personal cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation to uncover the family truth; micro-choices (winding, listening, searching) align with stakes. Interiority is textured if somewhat serene—few contradictory impulses under pressure. The acceptance of dissolution reads earned but relatively untested on the page. The “eloquent silence” is a strong trait but doesn’t exact much visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elowen’s motive evolves credibly from retreat to stewardship, with the unsnapping of the clasp as a concrete surrender of isolation. Interiority is textured through tactile engagement with tools (program, fruit) and embodied sensation (“shivering bliss”). Some emotional beats state outcomes a touch directly (“guardian not of solitude”), slightly smoothing contradiction. Still, micro-choices under pressure read clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eliza’s grief-driven curiosity and resolve to honor “small kindnesses” are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (brushing dust, prying the seam, deciding to transcribe) reveal character under gentle pressure. The contradictory impulses—retreat into solitude vs. reaching outward through others’ histories—surface credibly. Bodily and tactile details (ink-stained fingers, tracing the button) ground emotion. The final, quiet commitment feels earned and has a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—retrieve suppressed truths despite risk—and her doubt-versus-drive conflict surfaces credibly as she approaches the cache. Micro-choices (following the puddle-map, inserting the key under pressure) reveal values without safety-hedging. Interiority leans abstract at times (“tyranny of indifference”), but embodied actions keep her human. The Kael relationship turns the ending but arrives late, limiting depth of relational pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clean and persistent—hush the grandmother’s coded prophecy—and actions align (playing silences as counter-code). Embodied memory (cool metal on lips, dewdrops, her hands on his as a boy) gives credible interiority. Internal contradiction is light; he’s resolved rather than torn, which slightly flattens peak pressure. The cost registers as effort and generational release, not a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive to decode the leaves is clear and drives each choice (touching the speck, shifting her method). The interiority is textured but largely unconflicted—she meets the warning with eagerness rather than tension. The transformation is dramatized, not declared, yet the felt cost of abandoning pure order is only lightly implied. Micro-choices (prodding, lifting, building) do reveal character-specific priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s itch to “befriend uncertainty” is clear and threaded through action, with the “uncertainly certain” paradox embodied by his choices to follow signs and improvise under pressure. Interiority is concrete (workshop details, bodily stakes in the cavern) and his competence as a tinkerer informs tactics. The final stance shift is credible, though the cost reads modest and a few realizations are told (“he realized this was the key”) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elarion’s motives are clear and consistent—guilt and duty drive a sequence of precise, high-stakes choices. Interiority is specific (aurum with rainwater, salt/sulfur counterweights), showing a practiced mind under moral strain. The internal contradiction—“balanced” craft versus reckless guilt—is dramatized rather than told. Slight idealization at the close softens messiness but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (stringing the tooth, retuning to playful discord) align with it. Interiority is present but restrained, with most emotion externalized through action and image. The relationship with Thorne yields a clean pressure point via his resistance and her coaxing. Internal contradiction (ache vs. courage) is implied more than dramatized, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and character-particular: a survivor seeking the “mathematics of mercy.” Embodied interiority is strong (bark as Braille, UV as penance), and he takes micro-choices under pressure (wrapping the strap, bracing, triggering memories). Contradictory impulses—self-inflicted pain vs. avoidance—are present but could be sharpened. A quiet, earned endurance/renunciation lands at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories and completing her father’s work—is clear and consistently enacted. Interiority is vivid and particular (lens against the eye, scars aligning), though internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or struggles beyond a brief breath-catch. The micro-choice to trace the glyph and whisper the translation is motivated and aligns with her identity as a translator. Emotional embodiment is present but skewed toward lyric abstraction over concrete somatic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clear, specific motive (what ceilings hide) and a capable, observant technician who makes concrete choices (engage, pry the panel, pocket the barrel). Interiority is present but conflict is mild; the cost is mostly conceptual. The ghosts provide relational pressure, but their dynamic with Elias remains largely one-note. Strong competence somewhat flattens struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—compress eternity into a moment—is clear and consistently drives action, culminating in his choice to uncork the vial. Interiority is textured (ink-stained hands, trembling, heart pounding) but light on contradiction; he scarcely wavers before triggering catastrophe. The “cryptic letterpress operator” identity colors perception but doesn’t generate deep conflict beyond resolve vs. tremor. The final renunciation/price (sacrificing the library’s perfection) feels earned but could use one more beat of doubt or competing value.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive—transmuting failed revolution into myth-making—is clear and governs action (devising the ceremony, recruiting skeptics, inscribing veils). His inner contradiction (truth vs. healing fiction) is present but not deeply dramatized in-scene; resistance and cost are mostly conceptual. Embodied moments with the shard and the veils reveal character under pressure. The final choice feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear single-POV motivation (reclaiming light) with concrete, profession-specific behavior grounds Elias. A credible internal flicker—his doubt causing the chip to quiver—creates a small but present contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (aligning frequencies, refusing to break the covenant, banishing doubt via love of “the world’s melody”) are coherent. The struggle resolves quickly, keeping the emotional cost modest.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent (a “petrichor collector” seeking “where explanations fail”), and her cautious refusal to delve further reads as an earned, character-based choice. Interiority comes via sensory obsession and ritual tools, not labels. However, contradictory impulses are lightly sketched rather than dramatized under pressure, so the cost of stopping feels modest. The piece privileges poise over messy struggle, limiting depth of conflict within her.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive to restore “timewoven alliances” via carving is clear and aligns with her craft and temperament, and her micro-choices (taking shelter, handling the slide, deciding to carve) track. However, internal contradiction is thin—she rarely wavers or pays a visible price—so the arc reads more assured than pressured. Embodied emotion shows in tactile detail (calluses, knots as temporal knots) but skews declarative at the end. The final realization feels earned but costs little beyond exertion and awe.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is clear and consistent, embodied by repeated dawn returns and tactile handling of the postcards. Her interiority is specific (boots on thinning crust, tears at the window) and avoids therapy-speak. The transformation—grief reweighted into purpose—feels earned, though the conflict resolves a touch neatly. A sharper friction or cost on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—uncovering buried civil-rights truths—drives concrete choices (commandeering the pod, diving, parleying). Interiority is vivid and embodied, though contradictions are limited; she’s mostly single-minded with little counter-impulse beyond exhaustion and fear. Micro-choices under pressure (arranging debris as language) reveal values and ingenuity. The spectral guardian provides minimal interpersonal crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—to reject the bottle and rebuild through sustainable craft—is clear and consistent, with a credible temptation to flee creating internal friction. However, the conflict is mostly reported rather than dramatized in embodied micro-choices; we’re told he resists “false comfort” more than we feel it under pressure. The on-page choice to leave the bottle and start marking plots lands as an earned renunciation with modest visible cost. More sensory embodiment of doubt at the decision point would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motive (archiving emotional patterns) is concrete and consistent, and the choice to immerse the shaving under pressure reveals character. The internal contradiction—keeper of others’ oaths who “hoarded none”—surfaces credibly at the prophecy beat. The recognition that fear of forgetting drove his theft feels earned via the third-grade memory. The final acceptance is a believable renunciation with a subtle felt cost (loneliness acknowledged, guardedness relinquished).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (guarding lineages, reclaiming the vortex, discovering the “texture of borrowed time”) is specific and coherently drives her choices. Interiority is textured but largely unconflicted; she performs with near-perfect competence and little visible cost. “Furiously tranquil” embodies a distinctive stance, yet contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page. The final renunciation/endurance cost is conceptual rather than felt, keeping this just shy of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s restraint-versus-duty conflict is clear, embodied by his hesitation at the switch and the tactile choice to pull the bell rope. His curiosity and humility are dramatized through instruments, craft, and listening. The cost of his choice (forgoing the siren test) is present but modest, keeping his arc gentle. A hair more flaw or risk on the page would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—seeking strength in vulnerability—is clear and drives his handling of the lantern glass and the star-mapping choice. The interiority is textured but leans toward declarative insight over dramatized contradiction; his isolation is stated more than actively tested. Micro-choices exist (activating the projectors, pressing the glass to the dome, accepting a new role), though the felt cost remains modest. The final renunciation of mere maintenance for “guardian of vulnerabilities” reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—preserve the covenant’s “unspoken words”—is clear and consistent, and his choice to act silently by tracing the seam earns the ending. Interiority is spare but particular, built from attention rather than diagnosis. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers, so tension relies more on atmosphere than competing impulses. The cost of his stance (silence over speech) is conceptually present but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—grasping the “texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (clandestine postings, reconstruction) align under pressure. Contradictory impulses (fear of overseers vs. compulsion to probe) are present but not deeply dramatized in scene. Interiority remains character-specific rather than generic. The closing shift to embodiment reads earned but could carry a sharper on-page emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to find beauty in the incomplete—is clear and consistently enacted through tending shells, launching the kite, and reinterpreting its loss. Interiority is specific and embodied (shells, feather, wind), yet internal contradiction is mild and the epiphany feels tidy. The micro-choices track, but few pressures truly test her values beyond acceptance. Still, the final repricing reads earned within this gentle frame.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—leaving an interspecies legacy before death—is clear and action-driving, and his competence and ritual care feel specific. Interiority is present but largely single-note “brazen calm,” with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Micro-choices (tree selection, wire spirals, diary-guided adjustments) reveal values. The resolution earns endurance but skirts visible sacrifice beyond labor and illness.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to test and reframe “homecoming”) is clear and consistent with her luminous skepticism and academic rebellion. Micro-choices—following the footprints, opening the hidden door, lifting then setting down the amber—reveal her stance under pressure. The internal contradiction (doubt vs pull) registers, though the cost of her shift reads conceptual more than felt. Secondary characters (envoys) apply minimal on-page pressure, softening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s purpose is clear and embodied—his choice to seed the jetty’s “most barren cracks” shows motive aligned with action. Interiority is textured by his past and uncommon skill, but there’s little contradictory impulse or moral friction on the page. The birds’ guidance creates micro-choices, yet no hard trade-off or visible personal cost is confronted. The final stance shift reads earned but gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harlan’s motive (to bridge distance into closeness) is clear, embodied, and consistently drives his choices from scavenging to decoding. His interiority is specific to his “bloodhound” sensibility, reading rust and scent as story. The final acceptance (no reunion, but presence through the echo and leaf) feels earned with a visible emotional cost. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is present but not strongly dramatized under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives—grief, isolation, and compulsion to explore—are clear and drive concrete choices (returning, activating the console, refocusing the viewport). Fear and longing coexist credibly (the flicker frightens yet draws her), and embodied details (pressing the compass to her chest, sketching with trembling fingers) anchor emotion. The final shift—from solitary remembrance to active reconciliation and readiness to delve deeper—reads earned. The cost is mostly emotional and could be sharper, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clean and consistent (chivalry, “cautious abandon,” embrace of the unknown), with micro-choices under pressure like the hesitation before swapping the king. Interiority is present but light; we track resolve more than contradiction, though mercy toward the guardians hints at tension. Relationship pressure with Lirra is minimal on-page, mostly framing rather than a crucible. The final earned shift—apprentice into agent—lands but at modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (“historian of small gestures” who will unbind the archive) is clear and drives concrete micro-choices: spelling “release,” then pivoting to “sever.” The “benevolently ruthless” contradiction reads in action rather than label-only. Interiority is image-led but specific (flood memory versus staged crises). Emotional cost is present though more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s desire to reclaim “the shape of home” opposes her avoidance of pain, creating credible internal friction. Micro-choices (touching the stone with the feather, “seeding” the invocation) align with that motive and escalate under pressure. Embodied emotion and tangible costs (“threatening to erase the present”) keep her change earned. A slight tendency toward lyric abstraction occasionally blurs lived, immediate texture under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (self-forgiveness) drives concrete micro-choices from the chessboard to the labyrinth. Interiority is specific—“fidgeted productively,” tracing walls with a pawn—showing a mind sorting guilt into tactics. The internal contradiction (guilt vs. disciplined strategy) persists through illusions and resolves credibly at the mirror. The epiphany skirts ease but is earned by the incremental decoding and maze traversal.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive and flaw are clear and embodied—her defiance and “innocent mischief” drive the sessions and disarm Thorne, while her own betrayal surfaces as cost. The micro-choice to proceed despite mounting inner pressure earns the charged final stance. Secondary pressure via Thorne’s confession adds texture without hijacking focus. The ending lacks a discrete decisive act, but her endurance reads as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystal: an uncertain alchemist seeks meaning before literal dissolution; the ritualized micro-choices (which scar to match, what to confess) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses—self-doubt vs. resolve—coexist credibly. Emotional embodiment (burning lungs, workshop lurch) grounds the interior arc. Slight safety in the arc—no messy relapse or relational crucible—keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation (grief-ignited vow) drives concrete choices: the deeper venture, the painting, the spoken vow. Interiority is particular and embodied (breath echoing “like confessions”), with a credible contradiction between aloofness and the need to consecrate a moment. The cost is quiet but real: acceptance of impermanence rather than a magical fix. Slight limitation: pressure is mostly atmospheric, so the internal struggle never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is crystalline—grief braided with a need to prove subtle power—and actions (uncorking, kneeling, visualizing, waiting) align. Interiority is sensory and particular, not diagnostic. However, contradictory impulses (faith vs. doubt, proof vs. mourning) are asserted more than dramatized in-scene, so pressure on micro-choices feels gentle. The change—earning guidance and sealing the vial—reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (to transmute loss into a guiding network) are consistent and deepened by contradictory impulses—tethered to the sea yet mapping returns. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (the censer foot, the sticking dial) and lunar fluctuations that credibly degrade cognition. Micro-choices under pressure (persisting through the waning quarter, encoding riddles) reveal values with cost. The relationship to the absent wife stays active via letters, avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—to build psychological safety despite a compulsion to truth—drives concrete choices and culminates in a risky self-implant. His rationalist bent conflicts credibly with fear and the quasi-mystical remedy, and the involuntary admissions add pressure. The cost (pain, risk of “blinding” reason) is on the page. Relationship pressure is offstage, but his community’s fragility frames his decisions well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s creed of isolation conflicts with his compulsion to decode the stranger, yielding concrete micro-choices (taking the boutonnière, using his gift, pinning it to his lapel). Embodied detail (trembling fingers, salt-stiffened hair) grounds interiority. The final renunciation—accepting a shared “witnessed isolation”—is earned. The only softness: his deduction that the man sailed away comes a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s loneliness and the double promise (wife and grandfather) create a clean, credible motive that drives every action. Interiority is present via his “empirically intuitive” lens and occupational detail. However, contradictory impulses are underplayed; he rarely hesitates, so the climax lacks a thornier internal rub. The final step reads earned but lightly costed emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent (disenchantment driving defiance), and her choices propel every turn. Interiority is textured if largely lyrical, with limited on-page contradiction or error under stress. The relationship with Lirian adds light pressure but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. The closing shift (queen “reborn yet marked”) reads earned, though the cost is kept conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivations are clear and particular—Elara wants to “capture the density of presence,” Thorne wants to shed an ossified grief—and their micro-choices (hesitation, confession, infusion) align. Emotional contradiction is present but gentle; pressure never forces a truly costly trade-off. Still, the relationship functions as crucible, and the revaluation reads earned. The piece avoids therapy-speak while keeping interiority sensorial and object-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, specific interiority with credible contradictory impulses (envy vs. release) and concrete micro-choices (rising, choosing birch bark, writing). The motive—to metabolize dream-chaos—feels character-rooted and drives action. The cost is mostly emotional and quiet, but legible. Slight safety in the resolution (peace comes smoothly) keeps it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is specific and credible—seeking solace after anosmia—and her choice to bring, reframe, polish, and keep the screw tracks. Interiority is textured and embodied via tactile focus, though contradictions under pressure are gentle rather than tested. Silas adds quiet counterpressure without stealing focus. The closing renunciation/acceptance (keeping the screw as talisman rather than “fixing” smell) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to turn scars into stories—reads specific and embodied through tea heat, etched runes, and the crystal-ache under stress. Her contradiction (scholar vs. superstition) is active: she relies on old beliefs to solve what formal study can’t. Micro-choices (mixing tears with ink, pressing harder, offering a story to the sky) align cleanly with motive. The change lands, though the struggle feels a touch smooth, with minimal friction beyond pain.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s goal (an overdue apology) is clear and drives micro-choices—uncorking the bottle, kneeling by waltzes, risking a fleeting touch. Her contradictory impulses—pride, regret, urgency—surface in the orchard-dance memory and her admission of jealousy. Status dynamics with Theo shift as her contrition stabilizes his form. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting a fleeting reconnection) lands with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation is clear and persistent (to pierce cosmic illusions), and a flicker of internal doubt (“had he truly seen the end?”) adds texture. His micro-choices—using etymology as tactic, confronting spectral librarians—fit his nature. However, emotional embodiment remains abstract; the struggle feels largely conceptual rather than felt in the body. The final endurance/stance is earned but the on-page cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive is clear and particular, and his choice to use the peculiar key and count backward under pressure reveals him. Interiority is embodied (salt-stiffened beard, blood line) but skews toward lyric assertion over contradiction. The final renaming—guardian of time’s true measure—feels earned yet leans tidy. A sharper tug-of-war between caution and compulsion in the moment would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dual drive (duty vs. brother) informs micro-choices like taking the right fork and using the laser, with embodied perception supporting her “spatially gifted” lens. The crucible with the intruder is restrained but functional, and her final internal shift is earned if a touch tidy. “Sensed no threat” reads a bit convenient under pressure, softening struggle. The renunciation of the brother’s ghost lands but could register more visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and internal contradictions are clear and embodied—lighting the lantern, parsing scrawls, refusing neat condemnation while not repeating her father’s ruin. The grief is tactile (clover scent, rain, tears) and she makes micro-choices that reveal values. A few thesis-forward lines verge on summary (“no mere intellect; it was her inheritance”), softening the lived pressure. Still, the final renunciation-to-teach reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—“to teach endings how to begin”—is clear and consistently enacted through micro-choices (answering, probing, choosing release over repair). His pain backstory is sketched just enough to ground his method. The relationship pressure with Clara is credible and specific. A slight ding for the overt thesis line (“Because endings must learn to begin”) flattening subtext at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve small moments—reads specific and consistent, embodied by tactile choices (inking the photo, blending walnut husks with seawater). Interiority is particular to her archivist’s sensibility, though contradictory impulses are muted; she rarely struggles against an opposing drive. The closing commitment feels earned but low-cost. A relational crucible is absent, keeping pressure internal and gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradiction—elusive helper craving connection—reads specific and drives his choices (joking to gather, then slipping away). Interiority leans summary at times (“bound by reciprocity”), but his quips under pressure show character. The mask-cost is legible when his facade cracks passing the rock. A deeper embodied beat of temptation to stay would have raised the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, and her embodied perception (touch, vibration) particularizes her interiority. Agency is present in the choice to enter, persist, and kneel at the stillpoint, but contradictory impulses in-scene are muted. The forgiveness moment risks tidiness, with limited on-page cost beyond facing grief. Nevertheless, actions align with motives and a credible endurance change lands.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive—regret over the severed tie and quiet hunger for redemption—is clear and coherent with her actions. “Confidently uncertain” becomes embodied in the unbending and activation of the pen. However, she encounters minimal resistance; her internal contradictions rarely force a costly trade-off. The ending change feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s emptiness (camera without film) externalizes his loneliness, and Lir’s counsel pushes him to risk exposure by singing. Interiority is present but modest; hesitation before the hum is the clearest internal conflict. Relationship dynamics are effective: Lir’s guidance meaningfully alters Elias’s tactics. A deeper, more contradictory inner struggle at the climax would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent—an arsonist who sees destruction as rebirth—and her reverence for Lirael gives her a palpable drive. However, her internal contradiction (rebirth-by-fire vs. tenderness) never forces a hard on-page trade-off. Choices are mostly interpretive rather than costly. The result is textured but not pressure-tested characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s longing-driven agency is clear and consistent, with embodied tactics (the drumming) revealing her priorities under pressure. The rebellion vs. obedience tension is present but lightly rendered; internal contradiction could cut deeper in the peak beats. Choices align with motive and culminate in earned endurance at the end. Limited on-page relational pressure from Kai keeps the crucible largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (whispers over shouts) is clear and consistently embodied through tactics, with occupational specificity (gait-reading, maintenance hacks) grounding his agency. Interiority is efficient but a touch thin; conflicting impulses surface in the grin-mask and quiet ambition versus public nonchalance but do not bite hard. Status dynamics with Marco are legible and reconfigure at rescue. The endurance choice—opting for subtle method under storm pressure—reads earned if emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief and healer background give her a credible motive and embodied sensitivity, and the dental mirror anchors her choices. Her agency is quiet—she yields the mirror, follows, and touches the shutter—yet the internal turn from burden to tool is earned. The guardian’s purpose is a touch overtly stated, reducing mystery. Still, the change feels plausible and paid for by grief rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive is clear and consistent—he tutors to cultivate dissent—and his tactile relationship with the chess king embodies his resolve. His ability to hear unspoken words personalizes his mission and enables recruitment. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are muted; he rarely faces a pressured micro-choice on the page. The brief dynamic with Mira adds warmth and shared purpose but doesn’t force a relational trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound dock worker versus the pull of the deep—act simultaneously and sharpen under the whale’s call. Her micro-choices (keeping the scrimshaw, wading in, pressing it to her chest) align with a credible desire for freedom. The cost (abandoning a land-tethered life) is implied rather than embodied through specific relational stakes. Strong interiority with tactile detail avoids therapy-speak, though some lines verge on declarative labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—cultivating lightness against an emotional void—reads cleanly through her theatrical self-narration and whittling. The moral ambiguity is specific (propagandist who also whispered doubts) and colors her present stance. Micro-choices (choosing to narrate, to whittle a bird, to place it beside the bouquet) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Stakes remain modest, but the internal contradiction—blank face versus performative voice—feels lived-in rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—an aesthetically driven compulsion to dissolve boundaries—reads coherent and drives her micro-choices (touching the quartz, paraphrasing, wading). Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than labeled. The hesitation-to-certainty beat offers mild contradiction but resolves quickly, keeping conflict gentle. The visible cost remains conceptual rather than felt, limiting peak depth.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character-specific motives (Elias’s devotion to imperfection; Thorne’s loss via barter) drive choices, and the flower-language exchanges reveal personality without dialogue. However, Elias shows little on-page ambivalence under pressure—his “innocently cunning” tact never costs him, keeping interior contradiction light. The bond between the two is credible and evolves, culminating in a mutual act that alters their states. The final change for Thorne is earned by prior beats, though Elias’s emotional risk reads comparatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to find the “texture of connection” and her brother’s echo—is clear and sustained, and her gentle precision with the bell and lens reveals character through action. Interiority is specific (sound-color synesthesia; tactile handling of the lens), though contradictions are mild (yearning vs. skepticism rather than sharp opposing impulses). Micro-choices (ringing again, re-aiming the lens, refusing the assumption that loss severs all ties) feel earned but low-risk. The final renunciation—treating loss as bridge rather than severance—lands, with cost mostly emotional and understated.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s grief-driven motive is clear and consistent, and her choice to aid Lira grows organically from the vellum discovery and her workshop loss. Interiority is specific (hands trembling, mourning jewelry), but internal contradiction is light—she rarely resists or missteps. The final softening reads earned, if quiet. A sharper moment of risk or ambivalence under pressure would deepen character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained—she wants to map cultural shifts through her inherited deck—and her methodical temperament shows in concrete micro-choices (the tape, branching spreads). Internal contradiction is light; she’s confident rather than torn, so pressure on her psyche remains modest. Theo adds gentle counter-pressure but doesn’t force a hard choice between competing values. The final stance (toward a “living map”) feels earned though low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive is clear and sustained, with tangible micro-choices (erratic tracing, skipping panels, shedding the veil) under mounting pressure. The inner tension—yearning for forbidden knowledge vs. cost to her “untainted heart”—is embodied in trembling fingers, tears, and the veil ritual. Contradictory impulses are present but could cut deeper in moment-to-moment indecision. The change at the end (acceptance and marked transformation) feels earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the shape of hope—is clear and consistently embodied in specific actions (curating footage, coaxing the shadow). Interiority is textured through “luminous regret” and the tactile river stone, though internal contradiction under pressure is mild. Micro-choices exist but are largely procedural rather than fraught. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, if low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—balancing compassion with self-respect—drives concrete micro-choices (preparing gel, tending the tail, deciding to report Mira). Interiority is embodied (breath in mist, the cool tail) and character-specific (a handler’s tactile attention). The contradiction (tenderness vs. hard boundary) is present and credibly resolved. Minor slips into declarative labeling (“opportunist cloaked in green intentions”) flatten nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive—to read scars for meaning—governs every choice, from delaying surgery to digging while still aching. Contradictory impulses (pain vs. compulsion; fear vs. inquiry) surface credibly in embodied ways. The final acceptance after the opal’s vision reads earned, not abrupt. A minor convenience tilt remains in how readily guidance appears, but her agency remains primary.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear from the outset and her actions—entering the booth, choosing psychometry, deciding to “incubate” rather than force—align with it. Interiority feels specific (the tactile press of celluloid, the negative spaces insight), with a credible emotional cost in her tears and self-recognition. Internal contradiction appears subtly (seeker of others’ love vaults confronting her own unsent loves). The final vow flows from earned realization rather than a tidy platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular: to free a long-stalled creative core, tied to her history and the astrolabe. The internal contradiction (forcing versus surrendering) lands credibly at the pivot into rest. Embodied beats—trembling fingers, moss, cool stone—ground the lyric interiority. The change is earned but the felt cost is gentle rather than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (cultivate sparks amid ruin) is clear and drives his on-page choices, especially in the branching moment. His interiority is specific enough (dreamless void, equations as lullaby), with a credible price (curse persists). However, the emotional texture leans lyrical over embodied, giving us little sensory strain or contradictory impulse beyond mission versus risk. The faint smile and earned understanding at the end read as a credible endurance/renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear and sustained—he seeks to reclaim the “wild frontier” of his mind—but interior contradiction is light, with little friction beyond fatigue and doubt. Micro-choices (listening to specific trees, taking the gear) align with his goal yet rarely test competing values. Emotional texture skews declarative (labels like “gift,” “miracle”) rather than dramatizing a torn state. The final reconfiguration is earned but pays a modest personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—find the hound and claim unused courage—is clear and sustained, with credible internal tension between fear and the pull of the unknown. Her micro-choices (accepting the guides’ hand, continuing along indirect routes) align with that drive. The transformation at the cove reads earned but a touch tidy, with limited visible cost beyond relinquishing fear. Secondary characters apply gentle, relevant pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive (to understand safety’s cost) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—taking the rarely used stairs, stopping for the discoloration, pocketing the bolt, choosing to remain—track with embodied pressure. The internal contradiction (yearning for lost song vs. vow of silence/safety) operates on the page. A touch of thesis-statement neatness (“The unpardonable silence was no curse, but a vow”) flattens ambiguity slightly. Overall, specific actions reveal character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her tactics (cryptic marginalia, feigned curator modesty, rune activation) align with it. However, she faces little internal contradiction or cost; the piece emphasizes serene competence over struggle. The Varak exchange is brief and offers scant interpersonal pressure. Strong presence, light interior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to discover why paths disappeared) is clear and sustained, with concrete, character-specific behaviors (tapping, assembling overlays) under pressure. Interior contradiction (seeking solitude yet compelled to connect patterns) emerges, though it’s more tonal than decisively dramatized. The final realization feels earned by her methodical persistence. Emotional embodiment is steady but avoids riskier contradictions that might deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—finding meaning and a way to reignite the rebellion—tracks cleanly through concrete actions (opera glasses, entering the circle, humming). The “awkwardly confident” contradiction is embodied (toes curling, squared shoulders) and colors choices. Internal conflict is present but low-friction; she encounters little resistance beyond doubt. The final stance feels earned, though the cost is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motive is vivid and consistent, and her choices drive every turn. However, she faces little internal contradiction—there’s scarcely a beat where her insurgent impulse collides with fear or doubt. Embodied emotion is present but mostly channeled through mission-forward narration. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied (the gut twist, chest tightness, the easing shoulders) and her micro-choices under pressure track cleanly from freeze to breath to sketch to reframing the photo. The contradiction between hope and realism is active on the page and earns the closing renunciation of illusion. A slight reliance on therapy terminology (“somatic markers”) edges toward label-speak but is integrated as her learned practice. The final shift—photo as seed, not weight—feels motivated and costly without being tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s despair-to-agency progression is credible and embodied: trembling hands, claustrophobia, and the tactile labor of untangling threads. His motivation to “descend into necessary darkness” is consistent with his flaw (avoidance after loss). The choice to work the threads as a proxy for confronting grief shows contradictory impulses (fear vs. compulsion) in action. The final shift to sketching feels earned, though the cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motive (to understand the time-slowing) is clear and consistent, and her actions (reading the ink, deploying the drone, using her own vial) align with it. Interiority is present—“serene anger” as controlled blaze—but contradictory impulses barely surface beyond that stable register. Micro-choices exist (subtle pursuit over direct trail), yet visible cost or a charged renunciation is thin. Character reads distinct but not deeply conflicted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s duty-versus-truth conflict is sharply rendered, with concrete embodiment (gloved trembling, the hush pressing) and clear stakes. Her hesitation at the pod and ultimate transmission read as a credible, value-driven choice. A few on-the-nose articulations (“knowledge as the ultimate contraband”) flatten nuance slightly. The cost—betraying her vows and endangering herself and the preserved—is legible if mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifist resolve and tactile rituals are clear and specific, and her micro-choices (using the knife only to bind plant to relic, then sheathing it) align with her ethos. Internal contradiction is minimal—she remains unwavering—so the crucible reads more as endurance than conflict. Embodied perception (soil pulses, rose response) effectively reveals character. The final renunciation carries meaning but little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive is clear and particular—he seeks the goddess’s echo to heal grief rather than avenge—and his calm tactics under pressure (zigzag cast, voicing silence) align with that. Interiority is implied through action and sensory focus rather than told feelings, which works. However, contradictory impulses are muted; he rarely wavers, so the cost of his composure is not sharply dramatized. The mending at the end feels earned but light on visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s drive to expose truth is clear and propels decisive action, with family legacy shading her choices. Interiority shows in concrete noticing (the tremor, the hovering pen), but internal conflict is light and costs are implied rather than felt. The relationship crucible with Quill adds pressure but resolves quickly. Her final stance reads earned, if emotionally underpriced.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s grief-driven motive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (opening the drawer, reading Crowe’s letters, deciding to tether the amber) arise credibly under pressure. Contradictory impulses—fear of reanimating guilt vs. the compulsion to decode the cry—coexist on the page. The final renunciation/repricing of guilt feels earned by prior causality. Minor note: her tattooist vocation informs imagery more than on-page tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—finding “meaning in the mess”—is clear and drives tangible choices (prying the tile, interjecting, building the mandala, inviting contributions). Her social perceptiveness directs specific placements for participants, revealing character through action. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely falters or pays a personal cost beyond tension and focus. Still, the arc earns a quiet endurance: she engineers hush rather than winning an argument.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to armor empathy through renaming—reads consistent and specific, and her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, intoning) align under pressure. The internal contradiction (gentle radicalism vs. steel) is present, though sometimes stated rather than dramatized. The cost (“trapping her deeper yet freeing something vital”) is felt but could be embodied more viscerally. Secondary pressure via other characters is late and light.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eliza’s motive (seeking solace after the troupe’s collapse) is clear and embodied through her synesthetic perceptions and small choices (trespassing, accepting the coin, joining the dance). The relationship dynamic with the ghost applies real pressure and reveals her vulnerability without over-explaining. Contradictory impulses—nostalgia as comfort versus despair’s pull—coexist credibly. The emotional shift away from despair feels earned, if softly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s affectionate skepticism actively drives the plan, and Theo’s longing vs. doubt plays on the page with embodied beats (breath, touch). Motivations are clear and consistent, and actions align (the geode-as-lens choice follows from Elara’s aims). The internal conflict is credible but relatively low-stakes, with cost mostly conceptual (renouncing the pill fantasy). A touch of label-speak (“somatic markers”) edges clinical, but it’s integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal is clear and particular to her craft, and her micro-choices (buoyancy, retrieval, merging with the fossil, public narration) align with that drive. Interiority is present but light on contradiction; she rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses. The transition from guardian to herald reads motivated, though the cost of shouldering that role is mostly conceptual. Strong specificity of vocation stands in for deeper internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive—to unfix prophecy and disseminate choice—is clear and consistent, and her patient, tactile method grounds her agency. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a visible cost for defying fate-bound norms. Micro-choices (sorting by hue, sealing with intent to share) reveal priorities but not fraught trade-offs. The outcome reads earned yet comfortable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (redemption, mending courage) is clear and enacted through tactile micro-choices (kneeling, probing ridges, carving replies). “Prudently daring” is dramatized rather than told-only. The reunion with Marcus adds relational pressure but resolves quickly, limiting contradictory impulses under peak stress. Felt cost is mostly vulnerability, not a hard sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—distilling a generational vow to its core—is clear and character-specific, and his micro-choices (waiting, reinterpreting, mending, inscribing) align with it. The internal contradiction (duty as burden vs. duty as light) is credible. Cost is present but soft, mostly conceptual rather than felt as a sacrifice. Emotional embodiment skews abstract at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent: a contemplative maker seeking the method behind endurance. Interiority is textured (“startled yet serene”), and micro-choices—lifting/holding the glass, leaning into the kindness shard, setting the lens down, leaving with a new stance—track. Contradictory impulses appear but stay subtle; cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. The arc earns a credible, quiet endurance rather than a decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “wistfully pragmatic” core is clear and embodied (soil pH, heirloom tools) and her choices (leaving the garden, renting the boat, releasing petals) track to motive. The internal tension—guarded vulnerability versus the urge to risk tenderness—registers but remains relatively safe, with little friction beyond grief. The ritual at the harbor earns her stance shift, though the cost could be sharper on the page. A few lines verge on label-summarizing (“motivation… to reflect light into dark corners”) rather than dramatizing contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—translating isolation into independence—is clear and tracks through concrete actions (seeking the sundial, climbing to the circle, aligning the solstice light). The “brittle awakenings” provide a credible internal contradiction that resolves in scene. Cost is implied (leaving safety, accepting solitary flight) rather than dramatized, softening the turn’s bite. Interiority remains particular, though one line (“to translate isolation into independence”) reads a touch thesis-like.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her vocation and recent drift. Interiority is textured (handwriting loops, wax and whispers), but the internal conflict remains gentle with few contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivotal choice—opening the envelope and going to Liora—is credible yet low-cost. The reunion reads earned but emotionally easy, leaning more toward acceptance than a fraught renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and agency are strong and consistent, and her micro-choices at the console arise credibly from her worldview. The status dynamic with Harlan is legible and shifts when her interference undermines him. However, internal contradiction is light; she operates from steady competence more than conflicted desire. The cost to her personally is muted, limiting depth of arc.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s fear-versus-drive contradiction is clear and embodied (the claustrophobia spikes as the walls “shift and breathe,” yet she kneels and works). Her micro-choices—pressing and then tracing the compass along vibrations—align with a “prudently adventurous” ethos. The internal struggle is credible, if occasionally couched in lofty diction that distances us slightly. The ending shift (phobia’s weight lifted) is earned by prior pressure, though the cost feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive (rekindling empathy and reviving a wiped cold case) is specific and coherent with her methodical, face-blind artistry. Her micro-choices—coming alone at night, slow scanning, gloved collection, sketching—align with character. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely struggles or wavers, so cost feels modest. Still, her perceptual bias (seeing tensions not faces) is distinct and dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive to redeem Thorne is clear, embodied, and present in micro-choices (locking the door, working through the night, sending the encrypted query). The “nervously confident” contradiction reads on the page and informs behavior. A stronger felt cost at the peak (beyond emotional risk) would have elevated the arc. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in a credible, earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motivation and a tangible before/after: Elias shifts from lament to action. Interiority is specific (scarred hands, orphaned youth), though internal contradiction is light and the uplift feels relatively unopposed. Micro-choices (pocketing the flake, following the flutter-map, choosing to play) align with motive. Repeated labels (“dynamically observant,” “luminous disbelief”) risk telling over showing but don’t derail credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are coherent—rewrite a tainted lineage through reclamation—and his tactics (borrowing his father’s cunning while keeping his own poise) track. Interiority favors lyric distance over contradictory impulses, so the moral cost of using stolen currency as “territorial markers” is more implied than wrestled with. Still, micro-choices under pressure (nonconfrontational dissuasion; symbolic display) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The closing acceptance reads earned, if emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (decode the inscriptions; honor the mentor) is clear and consistent, and her choice to enter the lucid state and speak healing words aligns with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she encounters little friction or competing impulse on the page. The mentor’s urging adds pressure but doesn’t force a morally expensive trade-off. The final stance feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s guarded nature versus her compulsion to unearth “what mirrors don’t show” creates a credible internal tension, and her hesitation before handling the seed is a clear micro-choice. Interiority is grounded in sensory detail (numbing feet, breath catching), not therapy-speak. The emotional cost is present but modest, with risk contained smoothly rather than testing her limits. A touch more resistance or consequence would sharpen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive—repair the eclipsed covenant by finding the intersection of dreams—is clear and acts through concrete choices (using the clipping, linking via scars). Interiority is vivid and embodied (scars, sap, strain), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. The final endurance carries some cost (the wilted clipping, tingling scars) but feels relatively unopposed. Strong coherence, modest ambiguity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive (“to patch the holes in her soul”) is clear and consistent, and her “fiercely gentle” paradox informs her tactics. However, internal contradiction is mostly stated rather than dramatized under pressure; her path encounters little friction beyond Thorne’s brief skepticism. Micro-choices (stepping closer, pressing the card to the root) track with motive. Thorne has a sketched arc, but the relationship doesn’t force a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Jack’s interiority is textured and specific—his roadie past, the brother’s death, and the appraiser’s fact-armor create a coherent contradiction. The urge to throw away the grille cloth versus pocketing it reads as a credible, revealing micro-choice. Emotions are embodied through setting (dust, metallic tang, wind), not labeled. One line about “Purpose… wasn’t in the spotlight’s glare” skews a bit declarative, slightly dulling subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to bridge realms, understand transition) is coherent and rooted in her kindly, methodical temperament. Micro-choices—cataloging the seed, analogizing, planting while invoking lore—align with that motive. Internal tension (haunted ambition vs. gentle patience) is present but soft; pressure never forces a bolder contradiction. The closing resolve feels earned, though the visible cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    The titan-gear librarian’s motive—to preserve wonder—reads clear and consistent, with his moon-tied fluctuations creating a lived contradiction that informs choices (softening fingers, lullaby instead of force). Interiority is lyric but present through embodied tactics rather than abstract labels. The cost to self (risk of dissolution in flux) is implied more than felt, keeping the emotional crucible strong but not piercing. No secondary character pressure limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and habit of measured attention are clear, and his curiosity plausibly pivots the piece from inspection to consecration. The “heartbeat of a hesitation” offers a concrete micro-choice that reveals character. Internal contradiction is present but mild—the shift from pragmatic inspector to quasi-mystic custodian happens quickly with limited friction. Still, actions align with motives and the final renunciation (“he inspected no more”) reads earned if idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motivation (guilt over his brother) drives concrete choices—going to the station, cataloging the board, engaging the graffiti, playing the accordion. Interiority is textured and embodied through tactile details (ivy, shattered glass, callused fingers). The “daringly methodical” trait is shown as well as told, though repeated phrasing edges toward over-signaling. The final shift feels earned, if slightly tidy in its emotional calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear (find the library) and contradictory impulses (“cautious exuberance”) appear on the page, with concrete micro-choices (winding the watch, reinterpreting the cipher, venturing out). Interiority is more summarized than embodied at peak beats, and the cost of choices remains light. Still, actions align with motives and reveal a competent, wary mind. The ending earns a modest endurance/poise rather than a hard renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and particular—the empire’s call versus a solitary life—and the bodying forth of her “mulberry ache” gives the conflict tactile bite. Micro-choices accrue (hesitation over strings, consulting coffee stains, heeding plants) and culminate in the decision to play. The final renunciation of the empire is implied more than dramatized, softening the felt cost. Still, the change reads earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal is crystalline and carried through concrete micro-choices (preparation, chanting, infusion). Interiority is evocative but largely uni-directional; there’s little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse under pressure. The occupational angle (beautifying the dead) enriches motive and action. The cost is clear—she pays with obliteration—but the emotional struggle remains serene rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to locate contentment after forgiving a catastrophic betrayal—is clear and her actions (climbing, scalloping, choosing to continue care) align. Interiority is textured through tactile rituals and embodied labor. The epiphany via the hairpin/visions comes quickly, smoothing over deeper contradiction (forgiveness with lingering ache) into a tidy acceptance. Still, the final renunciation of “chasing a source” reads earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (fleeing rigid certainties, seeking nuance) is clear and embodied through tactile choices—the climb, the listening, the final “unhook.” Her contradiction (craving certainty while inviting ambiguity) is dramatized, not just declared. Thorne’s role as a gently coercive foil creates credible pressure without flattening her agency. A touch of label-speak (“welcome nuance,” “protected vulnerability”) slightly tidies complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear, and her withholding as a pedagogical ethic adds specificity. The stone toss and breath-syncing provide embodied choices. Internal conflict (urge to reveal vs. careful concealment; desire vs. risk) is present but remains largely conceptual. The final reaffirmation reads earned yet low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—mastering unmoving navigation—is clear and drives the scene from discovery to fusion with the arrowhead. Interiority is steady and character-specific, filtered through reverence for bones, echoes, and birds. However, contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays an on-page cost beyond vigilance. The change (achieving mental navigation) feels earned but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motive—recovering the sacred in simplicity—drives every micro-choice, from freeing the keystone to unstrapping the safety cords. Her underachievement and self-doubt create a credible friction that she pushes against. The emotional texture is present but often rendered in generalized lyric rather than particularized, contradictory impulses in the moment. A sharper embodiment of fear during the leap would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, consistent drive (the vow to discover the color of sound) propels concrete choices from pier to wreck to orb. Interiority is specific and embodied (cold water, warming tag), though internal contradiction is minimal and he rarely wavers. The final change (from routine lamplighter to bearer of a secret) feels earned by prior beats. Slight lack of visible cost beyond risk keeps it shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s aim (to align) and function (cast-lots arbiter) are clear, and her internal conflict—quiet enthusiasm versus “stellar doubt”—is dramatized in micro-choices (casting, listening, then sacrificing the coins). The decision to discard the coins forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority is distinct and embodied through tactile work at the receiver and the handling of coins. A trace of abstraction in rhetoric mutes some bodily immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s desire to transmute grief into purpose is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (deploying the recordings, refracting light, speaking names). Embodied emotion reads specific (scythe as “forgotten lover’s cane,” trembling hands) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction (mourning vs. resolve) is present but stays relatively tidy, with little friction beyond grief itself. The final pocketed crystal earns his shift without feeling pat.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives and contradictions (lukewarm power vs. brittle devotion, doubt vs. earnest faith) are clear and embodied in the bell-repair ritual. His micro-choices—timing drops, adjusting for wind, persisting despite doubt—align with his nature. However, the emotional cost remains soft; the threatened collapse of devotion doesn’t materially bite. Relationship pressure from Lira is evocative but offstage, limiting crucible force.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—guarding the levee and the community’s brittle peace—drives clear micro-choices: following the photo trail, gathering the images, and convening the families. The grandfather photo sharpens his internal conflict between inherited resentment and public duty. The “precisely humane” trait is enacted rather than merely claimed. Slight neatness in the final reconciliation trims complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to reconcile logic and intuition before the looming transformation—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (the flame rite, reading the starlings, accepting tears). Her internal contradiction (clockwork precision vs. secret sentiment) is dramatized rather than labeled only. The cost is modest but present: she risks her professional identity’s rigidity to embrace vulnerability. A touch of telling persists, yet the embodied turn with the melting crystal earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving trust under pressure—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives her choices. The doubt-versus-duty tension shows on the page (hesitation before revising the log; the buckle ritual) without devolving into label-speak. Her competence is balanced by a credible burden that doesn’t fully lift at the end. The cost is more atmospheric than concrete, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kai’s drive—to defeat his numbness—anchors every choice, from infiltrating the sanctum to cutting the field and choosing fusion over destruction. Interiority is specific (ego death as protective “yin”), and the final emotional torrent reads as earned cost. Internal contradiction (detachment vs. hunger for feeling) operates in-scene, not just in summary. Secondary players don’t pressure his psychology directly, but they frame the crucible effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s creative desperation and curiosity are clear and consistent, and his choices (planting, designing) align with those motives. Interiority is sensorial and specific (soil clinging, imagined warmth), but internal contradiction is light; he rarely resists or risks. The lack of a true dilemma or visible cost keeps the change more celebratory than crucible-forged. Still, his profession filters perception and action convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s longing to restore his family’s laughter is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his embodied focus (sweat, tugging cords, conducting) reads true. However, internal contradiction is light; “mournful eagerness” repeats as label without deepening into competing impulses or a visible trade-off. His competence faces resistance, but the price paid is mostly exertion rather than a felt moral or relational cost. The arc earns endurance but skirts a sharper internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s drive (homesick guardian seeking a way back) is clear and consistent, and her shift from endurance to active embrace reads earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (frost in fur, breath fog) with a credible hesitation-to-commit transition. Internal contradiction—feral instinct vs. methodic acceptance—could be sharpened at the crux to show more costly friction. The final choice feels motivated but not deeply self-wounding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is concrete and consistent—interrupt a stifling destiny—and is embodied in tactile choices (iterative trials on the crozier). The lineage/church obligation vs. forbidden alchemy conflict is legible in action, not just told. “Stoically sensitive” registers in the tremor/needle imagery and persistence under failure. Cost is implied (turning from the church) but not deeply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive and profession ground Elara’s choices, and her micro-choice to name and discard biases earns the internal turn. However, contradiction is modest—she releases assumptions without notable backsliding or visible cost beyond statement. Emotions are embodied (creaking stairs, wind, cold fragment) but the conflict stays largely cerebral. The renunciation reads credible, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s competence, optimism, and seamanship drive the action, and his micro-choices (calming passengers, seizing the hourglass, choosing the radio) are clear and motivated. Interiority is present but mostly functional; contradictions are light—fear vs. resolve could be deeper. The grandfather-story memory functions as character-grounded motivation rather than a deus ex machina, though it arrives conveniently. The final endurance (holding the hourglass, accepting the scar) reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive—to engineer intimacy—reads clear and specific, with embodied choices (uncoiling sinew, weaving neural-like patterns) that expose his contradictions: control vs. yearning, logic vs. fever. Doubt flickers while he pushes on, deepening pressure credibly. The cost is legible: altered memories and a reconfigured self-image amid debris. Minor note: his internal conflict could sharpen once earlier with a concrete counter-impulse before the eruption.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and measured temperament are clear and consistent, and her choices (experimentation, teaching shift, leading the demo) align with them. However, interior contradiction is light; her “balanced curiosity” rarely produces on-page friction or visible cost. Micro-choices under pressure are mostly summarized rather than dramatized. The brief exchange with Kai hints at relational pressure but doesn’t alter their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motives and methods are clear and consistent, and her agency drives each turn. Interiority is evocative but light on contradiction; she faces little internal friction when stakes rise. Her “contact tracer for hearts” identity reads specific and embodied, especially in the tool use. The ending choice is credible but carries limited on-page cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, specific motivation (vow to Harlan; honoring the forgotten) and embodied claustrophobia give Elias texture. His contradictory impulses—urge to flee versus duty—operate in-scene and drive choices. The cost (surrendering the codex, enduring the core) is felt, though interior conflict could complicate further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—repairing what failure broke—drives concrete micro-choices (using the shard, improvising a scanner interface). Embodied stress (trembling teacup, bleeding finger, heart rate) keeps her interiority grounded. The dynamic with Elias creates a live relational crucible that pressures her choices. The cost is mostly emotional and subtle rather than punishing, but it reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motive anchored in Elar’s copper-marked identity and grief over the language’s death; his endurance through the curse yields a credible Earned Stasis. Interiority is specific (veins aching, textures felt), though internal contradiction is relatively light (risk vs. duty is present but not deeply torn). Micro-choices (entering the tunnel, aligning facets, persisting through visions) align with motive. The cost is felt but not transformative to self-concept beyond resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (find truth, transmute bitterness) is clear and her micro-choices—pocketing the arrowhead, activating the phone, embracing the pull—track. Interiority is concrete (soil, cold, obsidian eyes) and character-specific. The turn to acceptance feels swift, with little contradictory resistance in the peak beat, softening the felt price. Thorne functions as a gentle mirror rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s goal and tactics are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (taking the shell, aligning it to her heartbeat, modulating the bow) align with motive. However, interior conflict is minimal and she reads as serenely competent; contradictory impulses under pressure are absent. The cost is light (aching fingers), which softens the felt consequence of her success. The mythic register narrows nuance but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and his choice to launch the drone under surveillance pressure aligns with his “respectful rebellion.” Interiority leans declarative (“believing that true borders dissolved...”) and saintly, with little contradictory impulse or embodied stress. The brief exchange with the young woman adds texture but doesn’t sharpen a relational crucible. The final reaffirmation reads earned but low-cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (seeking materials; interpreting silence as possibility) and a credible internal contradiction culminate in breaking a long-held vow to sing. Embodied action (prying the hatch, handling the fragment) reveals character without exposition. The cost of breaking his vow is present but could be felt more sharply in-body at the climactic beat. No relational crucible limits the range of pressure, but for a single-POV lyric scene it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied through specific, character-particular actions (tiling, whispering coordinates, handling the scarf). Interiority is steady rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. Her realization at the end reads earned but carries little visible cost. Secondary patrons add texture, not pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s desire to seize and decode the runaway dream is clear and consistent, and her actions (dawn shoot, darkroom ritual) align with it. Interiority is textured through tactile choices with tools, though genuine contradiction is light—she doesn’t resist the final release much. The shift from capture to release reads earned but relatively smooth. The felt cost is present (letting go of the brother-coded dream) but could be sharpened by a harder internal contest.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing vs. fear conflict is clear and dramatized via the trembling hesitation and the choice to hand over the hair. Interiority leans abstract at times, relying on repeated cosmic diction rather than embodied specifics. The locksmith provides pressure through a direct question and a method, but his opacity limits relational complexity. The final resolve feels earned, though the on-page cost remains primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim lost family memory through folklore—is clear, embodied, and drives each choice. Her hands-on competence and tactile attention (kneeling in root-clogged soil, reading gills) feel character-particular. Internal contradiction is light; curiosity largely overrides fear with little felt ambivalence. The culminating recovery reads earned but with limited visible cost beyond a pang of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—combative mentorship versus involuntary backward steps—are embodied and consistent, culminating in her first forward step. Lir is thinner but functional as pressure and mirror to her drive. Actions (tea geometry, annotated shard) align with motive without therapy-speak shortcuts. The cost is mostly internal and quiet but credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve wonder—is clear and consistent, and her actions align. However, she faces little resistance or contradiction; competence is untested, and internal conflict is minimal. Moments like “her hands scarred yet gentle” hint at depth but never force a costly choice. The result is poised but low-pressure characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive (ground the restless, especially her brother) is clear and active, and her guilt confession provides a credible internal contradiction. Her micro-choices—needlework, which knots to undo, when to speak—align with pressure. The relationship with the brother appears briefly but meaningfully. The emotional resolution leans tidy, with limited friction after the confession.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motivation (grief-driven empathy) informs each choice, from the archival cross-referencing to opening the latch. Interiority is specific to his craft and loss, though internal contradiction is limited (resolve rarely wavers). Embodied emotion lands in the projector sequence and at the threshold. The final crossing feels earned but the cost is mostly emotional and understated.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—an analytic search for the “physics of letting go”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (untangling the radio, pocketing the note, holding the snow globe). Interiority is specific and personal, threaded with grief without lapsing into therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses are gentler than ideal; he rarely wavers or pays a visible on-page price beyond melancholy. Still, the closing stance shift feels earned by prior discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elowen’s motivation—to voice the ghost’s encoded longings—is clear and aligned to her identity as a seldom-heard balladeer. Micro-choices (choosing the walls, using the plate as guide, pressing it to the mural) reflect consistent purpose. However, internal conflict and visible cost are minimal; she faces little resistance or doubt. The arc lands more as fulfillment than struggle, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive—“to seek out the joy beneath anguish”—is clear and consistently enacted through her decision to decode a private diary. The interior tension between curiosity and respectful distance (“affectionate detachment”) is present but carries little on-page cost. Her micro-choices (slipping on the goggles, continuing through gusts) show character, yet no crucible relationship is tested. The final stance shift (“ready to serve with newfound light”) feels earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation (prove the sky “remembers” Lena) drives embodied choices under pressure. Grief refracts through meteorological habit in credible, character-specific ways (emotion-tagged clouds, journaling). The risk of hypoxia and the refusal of protocols reveal contradiction without sermonizing. A hair soft on a decisive internal clash beyond endurance, but the cost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and constraints are vivid and consistent; her face blindness and tactile perception drive choices (decoding the coin, opening the safe, altering the mural). Interiority is concrete and embodied, with a credible shift after discovering the book. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (acceptance of limits vs. push to transcend), not fully dramatized in a charged trade-off. Still, her final endurance and vow read earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interior lens are clear and specific—“sociable isolation” paired with diligently curious drive reads credible. Her micro-choices (seeking the hold, decoding, deciding to share) align with character. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; the cost of moving toward the crew remains mostly conceptual. A sharper on-page friction or sacrifice would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s longing to move from mechanical fixing to “the rhythm of repair” is clear and consistent, with tactile ties to her apprenticeship. Interiority is specific (sea-salt, hoarfrost, breath fog), though contradiction under pressure is mild—competence largely smooths the path. The final redefinition of identity feels earned but low-cost. A hint more friction or a misstep in the hall would deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s altruism and organizing motive are clear and consistent, and Lira reads as a credible pragmatic lead, but interior conflict is light and mostly summarized. The Grovekin’s doubts are told more than dramatized, so micro-choices under pressure feel cushioned. Actions align with motives, yet the final communal act carries little visible personal cost. Character specificity is present but not deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation and motive—calibrating mercy and whispering a lullaby across lifetimes—are specific and consistent, and her hesitation between duty and the puppet head’s call registers as a credible micro-conflict. Her embodied cost appears in small, tangible ways (callused fingers, tears) rather than abstraction. The internal contradiction could tighten further under pressure; the choice is moving but not harrowed. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and earn the closing vow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s reluctance vs. inherited duty is specific and embodied (clumsy, practical, stubborn), and her micro-choices under pressure (using leaves, rolling nuts) align with that contradiction. Motivation is clean—save the travelers before frost—and the acceptance at the end reads as an earned shift. Minor ding: her instant decoding of the blueprint skirts effort, but the aunt’s lore and tactile etchings partially ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motives (atonement and reconnection) are clear and particularized through her polymer/symphony worldview. The tactile encounter with the chrysalis and the phone call show action aligned with interior pressure. However, contradictory impulses remain soft; the epiphany comes cleanly with little on-page resistance. The cost is felt but modest, mostly vulnerability rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive—to locate the origin of stories—is clear and coherently enacted through specific micro-choices (selecting a slate, incising, choosing the moonlight). Emotional stakes surface via “quantifying absence,” especially her orphaned beginnings and lost voices. Contradictory impulses are subtler than ideal; she rarely wavers or risks stopping. Still, the final renunciation (spending the moonlight) reads earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—transforming accumulated remorse before it breaks her—is clear and drives each choice. Interiority is specific to her palate-based gift and craft. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates once the pavilion appears, which slightly flattens the struggle. Still, her endurance under emotional contagion reads as an earned, character-shaped cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—fear meets resolve—as she chooses to act and then mediates tensions on the ground. The cuckoo weight as talisman externalizes her decisiveness nicely. However, she reads nearly saintly; we get little real friction or contradictory impulse under pressure, so her empathy isn’t meaningfully tested. The ease with which others fall into harmony trims the felt cost of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—becoming an archeologist of abandoned dreams—is clear and drives every action. His embodied experience (pain, tremor, sensory overload) reads specific and earned. Internal contradiction is limited; the piece leans more on resolve than friction, softening complexity. Still, micro-choices around the mirror/interface and endurance of pain reveal character credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, consistent drive—Elara’s curiosity and archivist instincts motivate each step. Interiority is particular (prism-minded perceptions), but contradictory impulses are faint and she meets little resistance. Micro-choices exist (going during inversion; taking the vials) yet the emotional cost is light. Strong persona; limited on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (reading the cracks, aligning the insulator, strumming) flow from a particular worldview. Interiority is present through tactile attention to wood and sound rather than abstract labels. However, contradictory impulses and visible cost are muted—she encounters little genuine resistance beyond patience and care. The result is coherent but low-friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (the dent biting his skin) with a credible push-pull of regret and disciplined hope. His precision motivates concrete actions—correlating silences, miming chess moves—that reveal character under pressure. The final renunciation of self-pity into a reset stance reads earned but the on-page cost remains modest. Lack of relational pressure limits crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s pacifist ethos and archivist impulse are clear and consistent, and his choice to use resonance instead of force reveals character. The interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; he meets little resistance beyond the lock. Tears and a vow provide an authentic emotional turn, though the cost feels more reflective than pressured. A sharper contradiction or risk in reading the diary could have deepened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s ambition versus her sensory vulnerability creates credible, embodied conflict, culminating in a pressured micro-choice to journal through the stench. The motive to soothe elders and “cultivate serenity within motion” is coherent and escalates under strain. Interiority is specific to her olfactory lens. The closing shift—ambition tempered by earned hush—feels earned, if a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation and competent, tactically driven choices under pressure (anchors, following the Cascade). Interiority is serviceable but thin—few contradictory impulses or embodied conflict beyond “heart raced.” The final pocketing of the tip reads as gain with little on-page cost or moral friction. Distinctive occupational texture helps, but the arc feels low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear, consistent motivation and competent, embodied action (anemometer setup, climbing the stack) ground Elias, but internal contradiction is minimal and largely subsumed by professionalism. The Harlan Voss patch adds a human tether, yet it doesn’t force a conflicted choice. Emotional texture stays steady—steady resolve over frayed nerves—limiting depth. The final endurance stance (work echoing against silence) is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular, and her choices (timing, precision of strikes) align with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers or pays a personal price—so the arc reads as controlled competence over struggle. Embodied detail (breath mist, callused fingers) grounds her. The ending reflects endurance rather than a conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (redeeming a failed guardianship through understanding) is clear and drives concrete micro-choices: returning, laying markers, uncasing, and playing the flute. The internal contradiction—control versus yielding—culminates credibly in the confrontation with her doubtful shade. Emotion is generally embodied through tactile acts and environment; a few lines (“demanded not just vigilance, but vulnerability”) verge on thesis-stating. The final stance feels earned with an emotional cost of surrendering her iron grip.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to quantify feeling coheres with her soul-borrowing habit and the letterpress craft, and her backfire-induced disorientation reveals a credible contradiction: hunger for order vs. lived chaos. The channeling of the astronomer’s melancholy is dramatized, not labeled, and affects her on-page choices. The final repricing—accepting pattern-as-flow rather than arithmetic—feels earned. The cost is felt in her loss of control and relinquishing the neat “equation” she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is clear and embodied (jittery nerves, tactile fixation on the pendant), and the final choice to give the pendant away aligns with his motive to honor Thorne. The internal contradiction—career courier guarding a singular relic versus choosing to relinquish it—registers, though it remains gently pressured. The shepherd functions as a crucible briefly, catalyzing the choice without overcomplicating it. Slight sentimentality in mentor-lesson restatements flattens some nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (to prove objects absorb emotions) is clear and enacted through specific, tactile choices. The sister reveal exposes a credible contradiction—projection vs. avoidance—and her apology and final placement of the prism register a felt shift. Emotions are embodied (breath fog, warming prism) rather than labeled. A touch of convenience in the frost-face apparition keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, consistent motive (reach the exiled brother) drives concrete choices—venturing, assembling, unweaving. Interiority is present and embodied, if sometimes generalized by lyric diction. The final sacrifice is credibly earned by established devotion to craft and kin. Limited contradiction in her impulses keeps the psychological texture from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s motive—coaxing resilience from rubble—is clear and coherently enacted through his descent and ritual. Interiority is present but leans on reiterated labels (“meek,” “quietly determined”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. A flicker of doubt (“had he truly bartered enough”) adds texture but doesn’t materially complicate his course. Relationship pressure is absent, keeping the crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and persistent, and her choices (activating the rig, forcing deeper weaves, returning) align with it. Interiority is textured, though internal conflict stays modest—she rarely hesitates beyond brief gasps. The visible cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through a tough trade-off. Still, the final renunciation toward “mapping responsibly” reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reticence and quietly protective instinct motivate clear micro-choices (adjusting the stone stack, opening the letters, pocketing the sea glass, rebuilding the cairn, relighting the lamp). His interiority is consistent and embodied through attention rather than exposition. The internal conflict is present but muted; the “luminescent ache” notes risk slight repetition in place of a sharper contradiction under pressure. The final vow reads earned by what he discovers and does on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Herald’s motive is clear and consistent—shaping a new dawn—and his interior contradiction (shadowed elation vs. isolation/obsolescence) gives texture. Micro-choices (tilting, steering, tempering the storm, finally extinguishing the wick) align with that motive. However, pressure rarely forces a true trade-off on the page; acceptance of obsolescence reads more as lyric acceptance than a tested decision. The emotional embodiment is vivid but leans conceptual over viscerally felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior conflict—watchful caution versus the donor heart’s pull—feels concrete and character-specific, embodied in tactile choices (aligning the wing, tilting the slate, rising to act). Motivation is clear and consistent from first paragraph to the final step. The change is earned, though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a consequence-bearing exchange. No secondary character pressure limits the crucible feel.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s obsession with what the trees witness grounds his choices and leads to the sextant’s reconstruction and the balcony reveal. Interiority is specific (maintenance routines, dream-mapping habit), though internal contradiction and on-page cost are light. Actions align with motive and reveal competence without strain. The change at the end feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation (rekindle a dying realm) is clear and her actions—excavating songs, gathering fruit, swaddling the window—align. Interiority is evocative but archetypal; contradictions are minimal beyond trembling and scattered memories aligning. Micro-choices do exist (which songs, turning to the window) but costs feel light and largely aesthetic rather than truly fraught. Strong, but not transformative characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear, consistent motives (compassionate recluse moved by a lost invitation) drive concrete choices: hiding the note, blending in, descending, returning it transformed. Interiority is particular enough (“felt the absent owner's regret like an echo”) though often told rather than dramatized. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs connection) are present but their cost is lightly felt. The final shift reads earned but comfortable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—seeking holiness in the ordinary to salve a betrayal—drives every action and remains consistent. Interiority is vivid and embodied (bread crumbs on lapel; frost; chamomile steam), with a credible, quiet endurance rather than a neat cure. The internal conflict is present but largely one-directional, with limited contradictory impulses dramatized in-scene. The earned stasis at the end feels honest, though the visible cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained—she’s driven to preserve the vows—and her gently meticulous nature is dramatized in precise, tool-based actions. Interiority surfaces in the memory of her own vow, but contradictory impulses or visible emotional cost are minimal. Micro-choices (aligning the slide, sampling deeper, recalibrating) reveal competence more than conflict. The endurance reads credible, though the arc lacks a textured internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive and flaw (steadfast loyalty) drive concrete choices across mounting pressure, and her micro-choices (counter-rumor, barter gambit, direct interference) align with that. Interiority is economical yet embodied (fingering the fob, the knot of dread). The cost is somewhat soft on the page—risk and exposure are implied more than felt. Secondary figures function as pressure but remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s aim (skeptical seeker drawn to weather-carriers) is clear and consistent, and her interior filter (taste-shifts, bioluminescent tattoos) particularizes her. However, she faces little resisting pressure and makes few consequential micro-choices beyond following the compass and asking one question. The final “she too might carry weather” turn reads earned enough thematically but lacks a visible cost. Emotional contradiction (skepticism vs. longing) is present but under-tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, specific motive (fear of immortalizing pain vs. compulsion to create) drives tangible choices, and interiority feels embodied (“charcoal-fingered,” tremor, cave-breath). The internal contradiction is present but resolves a touch smoothly once the safe opens, with little pushback or relapse. Still, the final choice reads earned through the mnemonic recall and lock metaphor. Visible cost (“luminous grief for lost years”) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive to recover “lost conversations” is clear, embodied through tactile choices (prying the board, assembling the map, ignoring Kael). Interiority is present but leans declarative, with limited contradiction beyond a brief ache at Kael’s lie. The leaves’ wilting externalizes her ethic effectively. Relationship pressure with Kael exists but resolves too quickly to deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias’s vigil to preserve wonder—and his seasonal muteness provides a credible constraint. Interiority is restrained; we get scars, anticipation, and a nod, but few contradictory impulses under pressure. His main micro-choice (to ignite the mechanism) aligns with his calling but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. Emotional embodiment skews lyrical rather than character-particular at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (protect the roses; quell inner static) are clear and intensify under pressure, with concrete micro-choices (initiating and then amplifying the protocol). Interiority is textured—nostalgia vs. duty vs. fear of obsolescence—embodied by pain simulations and processor “thorns.” The change (facing/miniaturizing fears) is earned and leaves a cost (blistering, a kept shard). A slight safety net remains in the tidy readiness note, but it reads as earned stasis rather than a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and her choices (sitting to listen, prying the locket, turning the key) align with them. However, she reads almost frictionless—minimal internal contradiction or visible cost; “sandstorm calm” risks saintliness. Secondary characters apply gentle pressure but do not truly test her stance. The endurance/change at the end is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (liberate her sister; turn vulnerability into strength) is clear and embodied in choices (dice, dance, journal). Interiority is vivid if somewhat idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a messy falter under pressure. Her competence reads high with limited on-page cost, softening the crucible with Silas. Still, actions align tightly with motive and culminate credibly in the liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, urgent motivation (recovering a deleted memory) propels Elias through concrete actions—divination, descent, and exhumation. Interiority is textured and embodied (lantern, trembling, brine, gravity pockets) without therapy-speak. The main softness is limited contradictory impulse on the page; his fear or doubt rarely challenges his drive. The final acceptance (carrying grief with regained joy) feels earned but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clear motive and steady interior resolve give Elar coherence, but internal contradiction is minimal and the ritual succeeds with limited visible cost. Interiority leans lyric-general rather than character-particular under pressure. The serene competence smooths away friction that could deepen character. Sweat and focused patience gesture at strain but don’t force a live trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity is concrete and actioned (sugar borrowing → weekly teas → rooftop interrogation), and her complicity in “agreed upon lies” gives her a credible internal tension. Thorne reads distinct in gesture and status (wire-rims, wax, careful hands) and applies measured pressure through mentorship and withholding. The final shift to initiation is earned but the visible cost is modest, more trust-risk than sacrifice. Emotional embodiment is solid if occasionally summarized rather than strained through harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute isolation into independence—is clear, consistent, and drives concrete choices (she initiates the archiving and sustains it through fatigue). The “charmed skeptic” contradiction plays on the page and resolves credibly into “quiet certainty.” Interiority is embodied through tactile action (humming, breath-matching) rather than summary alone. The cost is subtle but legible: relinquishing the whispers’ company and accepting solitude as chosen, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and character-specific: a forger using her craft to sever an old attachment. Contradictory impulses (“calibrated treason” vs. clung-to loyalty) act in-scene as she pricks herself and forges the unlink. Embodied cost (blood, surrendering the thorn) grounds the interiority. Occasional abstract phrasing (“wisely enduring spirit”) dilutes the otherwise concrete psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s drive (freeing her sister, understanding echoes) is clear and consistent, and the reveal that her songs strengthened the webs adds a credible internal pressure. However, the decisive choice (singing the counter-melody/ritual) arrives with minimal hesitation or contradictory impulse on the page, limiting depth. Embodied emotion is present but leans on recurring atmospheric cues over specific, character-particular behaviors. The final cost (a softened, sadder voice) reads, but her internal conflict before risking “eternal silence” is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her actions (arranging candles, aligning to the windows, touching the globe) align with her values. Interiority is present but largely assured; we don’t feel a live contradiction or risk that complicates her choices. The “weaves truth carefully” trait constrains her pacing but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. The final renunciation is more conceptual than felt, so the cost lands lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hiroshi’s motives are clear and embodied through small, specific choices (climbing, whisking tea, whistling, descending). His interiority is consistent and character-particular, though internal contradiction is mild and largely thematic rather than pressured on the page. The final stance—ongoing, modest audacity—feels earned by prior behavior. The lack of a sharper internal clash limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives action, and her competence reads persuasively on the page. However, internal contradiction is thin—there’s little visible cost or hesitation beyond ambient danger. Micro-choices (spotting the glint, reassembling, digging) do reveal values but without much friction. The final vow lands but feels more declarative than earned through a pressured inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation (“to shape that dawn”) with embodied beats (hand to glass, stepping into the gale). Internal contradiction—craving isolation yet catalyzing mass allegiance—appears but isn’t stress-tested in a live dilemma. Choices exist, but many impacts are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final stance feels earned, though the cost reads more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—becoming a translator between generations—is clear and drives concrete choices (repairing the box via jars). Interiority is embodied (pennies, frayed blankets, sweat, tears) and consistent with the vagrant-poet identity. The arc lands in an earned stasis/reconfiguration rather than a neat epiphany. Internal contradiction is light; persistence comes easily with little on-page counter-impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation to protect the relic is crystal-clear and consistent, and the mind–heart contradiction reads on the page through his analytical tuning versus visceral attachment. Micro-choices (key insertion, emitter tuning, voice modulation) align with his role. However, he’s a bit over-competent; struggle and visible cost are light, limiting depth. The “logically emotional” label is stated as much as shown, dampening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—training a volatile group toward patience via concrete rituals—while Thorne’s shift provides a readable relational crucible. Interiority is light but the embodied choices (“softly purposeful” hand on Thorne’s shoulder) sell contradiction under pressure. The change at the viaduct feels earned by weeks of practice. Slight idealization and limited internal messiness keep it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (professional rigor and personal history) are clear and cohere with on-page choices, culminating in a credible decision to defy the bureau. His “watchfully calm” disposition is embodied in measured action and attention to detail. The Clara vision meaningfully refracts his inner conflict, though a few labels (“fortified vulnerability”) feel told. The leap to a specific sabotage conclusion reads a touch neat, softening the felt struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motive is clear and credible, and his decision to bring the box and then deliver it to the daughter reads as an earned shift. Interiority is specific (the “second opinion” doubt) though sometimes stated rather than dramatized. Thorne functions as a quiet foil with a hinted past that sharpens the stakes. Embodied contradiction is present but modest; emotion leans reflective more than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core drive (to birth a “yearning algorithm” and ring an unheard bell) is vivid and consistent, and her curiosity concretely directs choices (kaleidoscope method, integration, activation). Internal conflict is light—“doubts gnawed like acid,” but she never faces a hard trade-off or visible cost beyond fatigue and risk. Micro-choices exist but under low pressure, so the arc feels more fulfilled than tested. Still, she reads as particular and embodied in a distinctive craft-world.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and propulsive, and her two lies under pressure reveal character through action. Interiority is present but could push further into contradiction beyond “brightly attentive” and quickened heartbeats. The final Earned Stasis—choosing concealment with ethical cost—feels credible and character-rooted. More embodied stress or friction in the lying beats would heighten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to prevent violence through empathy is clear and consistent, and the pause to consult the mirrors shows a credible micro-choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is modest (urgency vs. caution) and secondary characters are thin sketches. The final choice feels earned though the emotional cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to hear the sound of endings) is precise and drives her choices from volunteering to seeking Kai’s recording. Interiority is textured and particular (“fold in patience,” the parasol tip as anchor/sail). The contradiction between seeking endings and ferrying people to safety yields a credible, earned stance. Cost is present but subtle, more implied risk than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s motives—rootedness versus the ache of past love—read specific and embodied, and her micro-choices (offering shelter, exposing the charred fragment) are credible under night pressure. Contradictory impulses surface quietly: sentinel duty against hunger for connection. Liam’s presence sharpens, rather than dilutes, her interiority. At times, her insight veers toward tidy articulation (“not every union is meant to endure fully”), trimming some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s motivation to preserve the echo is clear and drives concrete actions (summoning clearings, performing the consecration). His “strangely honest” admission of fear adds texture, though internal contradiction is mild and stakes feel emotionally cushioned. Micro-choices are present and aligned with vocation, but cost remains largely conceptual. The final stance is earned yet conservative in scale.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (arranging photos, tracing arcs, deciding to share) align with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces simultaneous opposing impulses. The emotional texture leans summarized (“to transmute pain into a masterpiece”) rather than dramatized at key beats. The final choice to share reads credible but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive to decode language’s growth is clear and consistent, and his reticence versus the rush of digitization forms a credible internal tension. Interiority is specific—tactile attention to the crystal and shelves—without therapy-speak. However, on-page micro-choices are limited and low-risk; the pivotal moves (whispering, interpreting, shelving) carry modest visible cost. The endurance/acceptance at the end reads earned but gentle rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, singular motive (“to capture the sound of growing older”) drives tangible micro-choices (chalk, driftwood, recorder). The precognitive forgetfulness creates real friction (losing the path), though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized. Emotions are embodied (“hands… trembled”) and choices align with pressure. Change feels earned but the personal cost remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear, embodied in his craft and choices under pressure. His decisive, character-specific solution (listening to the leaf, altering the escapement) feels earned. Internal contradiction is lighter (yearning vs. practical urgency) but present. Emotional texture is specific and not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and decisively kind tactics are clear and consistent, and Elena’s regret gives the counter-pressure. Micro-choices—placing her hand, choosing mundane hymns—align with goal pursuit. However, Elara reads almost saintly, with little visible inner contradiction or cost. The daughter’s arrival softens the need for harder on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices (discovering and using the key; committing to rune-binding) align with it. However, interior contradiction is minimal—she is competent and calm throughout, with little friction or cost on the page. “Quietly deliberate” repeats as a label more than a dramatized conflict-constrained trait. The final stance (bearer of the subtle key) feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus fierce yearning—are clearly dramatized, culminating in the choice to innovate on ritual despite her doubts. Professional detail (bone setter) grounds her actions and reveals character under pressure. The cost—accepting echoes rather than her daughter—is felt, if a touch tidy. Occasional label-telling (“forgiving skeptic,” “shrewdly innocent”) slightly flattens otherwise strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and specific: trauma from fire, a vow against flame, and a desire to share light by reflection. Micro-choices (finding, weighing, polishing, and presenting the sea glass) align with her values. Internal contradiction (earthbound gaze vs. longing for the stars; isolation vs. outreach) is present but gently rendered rather than pressurized. The renunciation of isolation registers, though its on-page cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives—exposure after a viral confession and the desire to reclaim meaning—drive concrete choices, especially the risky offering of the pendant. Contradictory impulses (hurt vs. reclamation) are embodied rather than labeled, with tactile attention to the pendant and the moss. Kai is lightly sketched but credible as a mirror without stealing focus. The final renaming of the pendant’s meaning feels earned, not conveniently epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s fear of completion versus devotion to preserving ephemeral hopes is clear, embodied (trembling fingers, warming shell), and drives concrete choices (resolves to continue, performs the rite, presses the shell, finishes). The interiority is particular and avoids therapy-speak, though the pressure remains almost entirely internal. The change—from doubt to committed completion—feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than felt. Minor abstraction at peaks softens the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s goal is clear and consistent, and her craft choices on the loom track directly to that motivation. Interiority has a few grounded touches (mother’s chant, nights tinkering) but little live contradiction or cost. The villagers and elder add light relational pressure without true friction. The ending endurance/renunciation cost is minimal, keeping the arc emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—mapping grief through alchemy—is clear, embodied, and drives each micro-choice (arranging refuse, igniting flash paper, sealing the plate). Interiority is specific to her vocation and loss without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is modest: she endures rather than wavers, so tension stems more from patience under cold than from competing impulses. The ending reflects earned endurance with a felt physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular: a reflective locksmith seeking to rationally preserve wonder and cope with war-borne loss. Interiority is textured (peripheral focus, the cellar of reason) and aligns with his craft. However, on-page struggle is gentle; few pressured micro-choices or contradictory impulses are dramatized beyond methodical adjustments. The final acceptance—storing echoes as diagrams—lands, but its cost is more implied than bodily felt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (counter her fractal curse by collecting burdens) is clear and embodied in concrete micro-choices (igniting and orienting the burner, selecting burdens). Interiority is distinctive—recursive scars, “boundary-less” entrapment—without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction (prison vs loom/purpose) is present but soft, with little on-page price beyond endurance. The final stance feels earned but the emotional cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—“to harvest lessons from loss”—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro-choices (lingering in crystals vs. returning to the kettle and carving). Interiority is specific and embodied via tools, rain, ash wood, and the circus lexicon. Contradictory impulses (dwelling in suspended time vs. moving forward) coexist credibly. The closing choice to carve reads as an earned endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—salvaging meaning from eroded ambitions—drives concrete choices (scavenging, bargaining) under pressure. Interiority is textured and embodied (“boots splashing through shallow pools”), with credible contradiction between regret and resolve. The renunciation (not reclaiming the wheel but weaving regrets) reads earned. Slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in places prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is coherent and rooted in professional curiosity and a service ethic, and her choices (using the sextant to re-route flows) align with that. However, internal contradiction and visible emotional cost are minimal; competence largely carries the day. Embodied detail appears (dust, hums, vibrations) but affect remains steadied by a uniform “stoic wonder.” The ending’s change reads earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and particular: to make peace with an abandoned dream, consistent with his introverted retreat into the tower. The interiority is embodied through tactile acts (kneeling, placing the unfinished clock face), and the prior rejection by elders provides credible pressure. Contradictory impulses—avoidant habit versus the pull to face the forecourt—are present but lightly contested, yielding a gentle rather than volatile arc. The renunciation feels earned, though the emotional price is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to dismantle the architecture of lies—drives each choice from sensing the current to diving and then reinterpreting himself at the end. Interiority is specific and filtered through tactile habits (reading eddies, the pocket sundial) rather than labels. However, the on-page struggle is light; the dive and opening of the chest come too easily to fully test his contradictions. The closing realization feels earned but pays a conceptual cost more than an embodied one.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation (preserve ancient methods) drives every choice, and his tactile patience under snow gives embodied emotion. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or risks a wrong move. The micro-choices (pause, whisper, resume decoding) feel credible and aligned with his temperament. The final endurance/capture reads earned but not deeply torn by competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive (mapping healing via living obituaries) is clear and embodied in tactile choices (pulling the thread, staying to write). The internal contradiction—seeking connection while choosing solitude—registers, though pressure on that conflict stays low. Interiority is specific and object-linked rather than generic. The endurance/renunciation (missing the ship) carries credible cost even if the choice is largely pre-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elarion’s motive—to reawaken lost beauty—drives concrete micro-choices (collecting relics, assembling the cradle, placing the orb) and culminates in a vow. Interiority is textured and embodied (callused hands, matted hair), if slightly over-reliant on the “hypothesizing” frame. Internal contradiction is present but muted (obsessive, quasi-mystical yearning amid a decaying, rationalist world). The final renunciation/commitment reads earned, though cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and history are vividly drawn, and her choices (to graft, to use her father’s coin, to meet the wanderer without judgment) align with her ethos. However, the piece avoids showing contradictory impulses in the moment; she rarely wavers or pays a visible immediate price beyond solemnity. The wanderer supplies a relational counterpoint, but he applies little pressure. The result is layered but low-friction characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—liberate the trapped memories and salve her own loss—drives every choice, and her “luminous skeptic” stance stays consistent. The interiority is specific (mapping decay into a clue network; envisioning the glass yielding). Internal contradiction (skepticism vs. imaginative belief) is present but mild, with limited on-page resistance at the peak. The cost is mostly endurance and emotional exposure; credible but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motive—share light without fire—remains consistent and drives her central choice at the nexus. The interior conflict (recognition vs. inevitability) is clear, though it’s rendered more in lyrical abstraction than embodied micro-choices. The vision of descendants mirrors her doubt and deepens the bind credibly. Still, the choice to proceed lands as earned endurance rather than a sharp renegotiation of self.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his craft and the need to map collective grief. His micro-choices—returning nightly, unrolling the ribbon, choosing a collective inscription—align with his contemplative nature. Internal contradiction is limited; the piece privileges steady poise over friction. Still, the final renunciation (from individual memorials to a collective monument) reads earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s ethic of precision and guilt are convincingly fused; his choice to follow the apparition and to confess grows credibly from decades of penance. Interiority is textured through tactile anchors (gears, ridge, bioluminescence) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses—duty vs. shame, steadiness vs. trembling—coexist on the page. The final decision feels earned and carries social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s blithe steadiness and gentle curiosity are clear and consistent, and his methodical decoding aligns with those traits. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; he rarely faces contradictory impulses or a felt price. His micro-choices (kneeling, pocketing the case, moving to the silo, decoding) are coherent but low-pressure. The ending’s realization lands, but the cost to him is faint.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—seeding innovation under constraint—is specific, consistent, and pressures every micro-choice (ascent, chart selection, iteration). Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. persistence) are dramatized rather than declared. Embodiment (thin air, metallic tang, trembling hands) grounds interiority. The final charged poise is earned, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s diligence, secrecy, and yearning are clear, and his shift from copyist to conduit reads motivated by the pirate signal. Interiority is sensorially grounded (ink-stained fingers, ember glow), and micro-choices—tuning the dial, gathering dust, embedding lyrics—track his values. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on-page cost; his change meets minimal resistance. The arc is credible but too frictionless for top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s motive—crystallizing her mother’s fleeting tenderness—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (mask construction, ash sealing). Contradictory impulses surface subtly (yearning for safety vs. exposing fracture) but rarely clash on the page in a peak-pressure moment. Her micro-choices align with the goal and reveal cost without melodrama. A touch more visible struggle or risk during the making would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and specific—preserve “ancient methods”—and contradictions (guardian vs grave-robber) are dramatized in scene. Embodied interiority (the cog’s teeth biting skin, bioluminescent hush) grounds his abstractions. The final renunciation (keep the cog buried) is earned by prior beats and costs him influence and connection. Minor note: occasional thesis-like lines risk flattening emotion into stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motive—to braid voices and unlearn hatred—is clear and consistent, and his past gives credible ballast. Interiority exists but tilts toward summary over pressured micro-choices, with students sketched as types rather than full crucibles. His “expectantly resigned” stance shapes his pedagogy but rarely forces a hard on-page trade. The final endurance reads earned, if gently so.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motive—reclaiming erased heritage through food—drives concrete choices (entering the greenhouse, pruning, planting the seed). Interiority is specific (tasting sap triggers lived memories) and embodied. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he faces little genuine ambivalence or pressure testing his “gentle rebellion,” which softens the felt cost of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to preserve wonder while constrained by involuntary truth—drives his specific choices (producing the lacquer box, routing truth through riddle). The internal contradiction (desire to cloak vs. compulsion to reveal) is credible and dramatized. Lira’s goal (repair) is clear, if more functional than dimensional. Embodiment is adequate though not deeply textured under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motive—diagnosing and reversing the bay’s creeping hush—is clear and drives entry, discovery, and the sanctifying action. Interiority is particular (his “creeping normality noticer” lens) and the micro-choices with objects reveal values. The arc from passive noticing to “quiet guardianship” reads earned. Slight limitation: minimal on-page friction or contradictory impulses undercut peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s misbelief (soulless construct) meets credible pressure and shifts via concrete actions (taking the ampoule, threading the crack). Lirien’s incisive kindness applies relational pressure without flattening into sentimentality. Some interiority is told rather than embodied, but micro-choices under stress remain clear. The change reads earned with a modest, not deep, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—recapturing a missed chance—drives concrete micro-choices (rolling dice, choosing precision over plunge, anchoring the lemma with the dice). The internal contradiction (grim optimism vs. fear of reckless risk) is dramatized rather than told. Emotions are embodied through tactile images (the chipped die, dust-caked step). Slight safety-hedging at the end (victory without visible harm) softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV interiority is rich and specific; Elias’s motive (“to prove that strangers remember kindness”) coheres with his actions at the bench. His insomnia and fragile hope feel embodied in tool-use and sensory focus. Internal contradiction is mild (no strong counter-impulse beyond fatigue), so pressure remains gentler than elite-tier. The earned quiet at the end reads credible rather than platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to rescue a dying custom—drives every beat, and her contradictory impulse (using the lens to save vs. realizing it accelerates the thaw) adds credible tension. Interiority is specific (rosewater dread; tactile fear on the ledges) and actions align with her museum-curator identity. The final choice to risk the tools’ preservation for living practice earns her turn. A deeper flaw beyond preservation-fervor would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear, specific motive (“step beyond fate’s design”) drives every action, and his occupational detail (“neatly inventive”) credibly informs tactics. Interiority is textured with “bleak exhilaration,” but contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized in micro-choices. We don’t see a tough trade-off beyond endurance and risk; emotion remains controlled rather than fraying under peak pressure. Still, actions align with motive and yield an earned, felt shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive (trick fear to expose its weakness, rooted in guilt over her sister) is clear and drives concrete choices (touching the clasp, decoding the paradox, confessing). Interiority is textured with sensory bias and contradictory pulls (repulsion/attraction), but the emotional price of confession reads a bit tidy. The advisor relationship functions but remains psychologically under-explored beyond a useful whisper. The final shift feels earned enough but could bear more felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Leeward’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is clear and enacted under pressure, especially when he “dubs” the apple tree and planks. Interiority is largely lyric-conceptual rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal trade-off. Competence dominates struggle, trimming the felt cost of his choice. Still, actions align tightly with motive and reveal a distinctive worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—find her brother by interrogating the watchers—drives concrete actions (climbing the rim, playing the whistle, persisting through no response). Her “quiet drive” meets embodied doubt (“sweat tracing dread’s path”) to create credible internal friction. Micro-choices under pressure are clear and value-revealing. The arc ends in an earned renunciation/acceptance: Thorne is lost in a new form, and she takes on a costlier quest.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and coherent, and the grandmother detail supplies a credible tug-of-war between solace and truth. However, internal conflict is often stated rather than dramatized, with “emotionally rational” repeated as a label instead of shown under sharper pressure. His micro-choices (entering, examining, deciding to “recapture”) align with motive but face little resistance. The change at the end reads as a firming of stance with modest on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are coherent and specific: a precise professional whose empathy compels him to literalize remembrance. The inkwell discovery reveals his contradiction (stoic method versus trembling receptivity) and drives a credible shift. Micro-choices under pressure—wading in cold water, deciding to embed notes—align with his values. A clearer on-page cost to this choice would elevate the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her interiority feels particular (archivist lineage, logical indexing). The doubt-versus-resolve tension reads, but the on-page cost of her choice remains largely conceptual. Micro-choices (kneeling, readjusting, stamping) reveal character, though the struggle feels low-risk. A deeper flaw surfacing under pressure would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—alchemizing grief through craft—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (selecting the amethyst, fitting the gem, folding cranes). Interiority feels embodied (callused hands, trembling) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he both clings to Lira (recorded dreams) and chooses release (letting cranes go). The final endurance toward “fragile peace” reads earned, with a felt cost of not erasing grief.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive is sharp and persistent, braided from grief and scientific obsession, and his micro-choices (positioning the crystal, adjusting perturbations, deciding to strike back) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with the geode functioning as a tactile grief-anchor. Contradictory impulses—yearning for salvation vs. weaponizing loss—surface credibly at the crystal’s awakening. Slight ding for limited on-page cost beyond resolve; the vengeance turn feels earned but emotionally cushioned by rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s competence and quiet displacement are clear, and her micro-choices (activating the drone, inserting the chip, pulling the lever) align with her motive. Interiority is image-led but specific enough to feel character-particular (the “perpetually surprised” gaze used as a lens). Internal contradiction (seasoned pilot vs. search for belonging) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressured into a thorny choice. The final softening into wonder reads earned if modest in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives are clear and specific: a liar-for-hire who lied “as a gift” to his daughter, now buckling under accumulated guilt. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual (sifting driftwood, clutching the watch hand) rather than therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses—protective lie vs. duty to truth—coexist on the page and culminate in a credible vow. The lack of Eliza on the page narrows relational crucible pressure but doesn’t undercut his earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven caution and desire to transmute error into peace read consistently and motivate his key choices (the pause at midpoint, handing Tomas the drawer pull). His interiority is concrete (the talisman, the remembered fiasco) without therapy-speak. The relationship pressure with Lira and Tomas is legible, though Elias’s internal contradiction remains muted rather than sharply torn. Lira functions cleanly as pressure, if somewhat spare.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s motive and flaw are clear and particular, and his choices (launching despite a broken compass, switching to utility poles) align with his psychology. Interiority is textured with embodied detail (rope-rough thumb, humming shanty). However, the reconciliation is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the earned-cost feel. The “merrily melancholic” tone hints at contradiction but isn’t tested in a concrete on-page confrontation with Lena.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation (a clean slate seeker confronting a dirty past) is clear and drives concrete choices, especially at the fork where “run” vs “confront” becomes literal. Interiority is specific—reading codes in obits, sensing the lake’s “scent of earth and secrets”—and his weeping at victim-visions reads earned. The shift to empathy feels credible if swift for the length. Minor ding for on-the-nose phrasing (“His motivation crystallized…”) that edges into telling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motive (reforging the bond) is clear and her reluctance creates credible internal friction that resolves in an earned choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (spices, fur, bone-softening). Micro-choices are limited to a single arc from resistance to commitment, but they track. The visible cost—shedding human form—is present though its long-term weight is softened by the “core unchanged” reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—atonement and reclaiming lost time after her child’s birth—is clear and consistently embodied through ritual choices (unfastening the bundle, tracing, aligning the crack, pressing the daughter’s print). Contradictory pulls (legacy she rejected vs. motherhood and return) surface credibly without speechifying. The final stance shift (ready to descend) feels earned by on-page acts. Slight limitation: pressure remains mostly internal/lyric, with few hard trade-offs beyond emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s pacifism is intrinsic and tested by confronting archived violence; his choice to initiate and persist in the ritual reads motivated and specific. The internal contradiction—recoil from rage yet choosing to face it—shows on the page. Micro-choices (scanning, stitching, embedding the tear) align with his values. The cost is mostly emotional, not materially felt, but credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motivation is clear and coherent (a giver seeking the “texture of transformation”), and his micro-choices (detouring, freeing the fireflies, sharing food) align with that impulse. Interiority is present but leans generalized lyricism over character-particular contradiction; we rarely feel simultaneous, competing impulses. The philanthropic trait drives action, but pressure never forces a hard trade-off beyond small comforts. The final understanding feels earned by accumulative experience rather than a decisive internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. However, there’s little on-page internal contradiction or embodied cost; she rarely falters or doubts. Secondary characters arrive but don’t apply pressure that complicates her stance. The ending confers identity (“became the spark”) without confronting a tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s drive (to master her precognition and honor a promise) is clear and coherently embodied in the ritual. Doubt and compulsion coexist on the page, though micro-choices beyond the stone placements are limited. Interiority is vivid but sometimes leans abstract, softening the sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. The final step into the aurora feels motivated, if not hard-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation and a credible inner drive; his micro-choices (setting the timer, hiding/retrieving the envelope, deciding to descend) align with his aim. Interiority is specific to a poet’s sensibility, though occasionally abstracted into aphorism. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are present but mostly harmonized, lowering friction. The final choice feels earned with a modest, legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (turn questions into destinations; avert bloodshed through intellect) are clear and consistent, with credible inner tension between martial reflex and diplomatic impulse. Embodied details—the whir of the mechanical arm, sweat in humid air—ground his conflict. The final renunciation of a duel in favor of alliance reads earned but the on-page cost remains mostly conceptual, not viscerally felt. The rival is lightly sketched, limiting relational crucible depth at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—forge beauty from chaos—tracks cleanly into action, and his “molting” gives him a credible internal contradiction pivoting from archivist to catalyst. Marcus has distinct presence and skill that shapes tactics (binding, shelf repair), with a believable bond forged through work. Emotional embodiment is mostly in image rather than scene pressure, so the relationship’s stress tests feel gentle. Still, the final stance—risking resistance—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular motivation (play for her; defy fate) and embodied choices (digging out the reel, rigging a projector, choosing to perform) reveal a consistent, strategically creative temperament. Interiority is textured and character-specific (“steely longing,” station pianist’s ear for harmonies). The internal contradiction (nostalgia vs. forward-making) is present but lightly tested—he rarely falters under pressure. The closing stance shift feels earned, though the felt cost remains more lyrical than bruising.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (protect cultural memory) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices—planting the seed, interpreting dreams, leading the ritual. Contradictory impulses (confidence in documented phenomena vs. “luminous doubt”) operate simultaneously and shape action. The cost is largely psychological (accepting uncertainty and responsibility), credible at this length. A deeper on-page price beyond doubt could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—atonement through finding a hue—is clear, character-particular, and drives concrete choices (recovering the compass, decoding lace, performing the ritual). Interiority is textured with bonsai craft and grief without therapy-speak. The internal contradiction (tender caretaking vs. pride that “pushed too hard”) is present but stays mostly subtextual. The earned change (voicing apology, weaving pine) lands with a felt cost scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation for a quieter, more authentic scientific pursuit is clear and compelling, born credibly from her humbling circumstances. Her internal conflict is well-realized, and the change she undergoes feels earned by the story's conclusion. The characterization is very strong, with the only minor weakness being moments where her humility is stated ("Humility kindled within her") rather than purely embodied in action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s character is primarily defined by her profession, which is successfully leveraged in the plot. However, her core motivation is over-articulated with the phrase "to discover purpose in the pauses," which reads more like a thematic label than an embodied, contradictory impulse experienced under duress. The repetition of the trait "steadily adaptive" also feels told rather than purely shown, slightly flattening her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, and his arc from haunted survivor to purposeful creator is earned through the story's central action. His internal conflict is effectively externalized via the heat-map. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by relying on descriptive labels like "silently expressive" and a final line that summarizes his internal shift rather than letting the preceding actions carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from his initial weariness to his final, earned stasis. The internal conflict between his desire for personal peace and his professional duty is well-dramatized through his interaction with the lens. His character change feels earned, though the repeated explicit labeling of his stubbornness ("inadvertently stubborn") is a minor tell in an otherwise show-driven characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving her from observation to action. However, her interiority occasionally relies on declarative statements ("her heart swelling with the motivation that had sustained her") rather than fully embodied or contradictory emotions. She functions more as a stable pillar of resolve than a character grappling with deep internal conflict, which, while fitting the story's tone, slightly flattens her dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the inciting past-life memory to the final act of healing. Her interiority is palpable, though it sometimes leans on thematic labels ("pilgrim of sparks," "spiritually curious soul") rather than fully embodied contradiction. The change she undergoes—from seeking a physical place to understanding an internal, shared one—is earned through the central action, but the resolution of her internal conflict feels slightly too smooth once the healing begins.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear, conceptually rich, and consistent. The initial conflict between his desire to "impose order" and the garden's living chaos provides a solid internal contradiction. However, his emotional experience, particularly during the peak crisis of being trapped, relies on abstract labels like "quaking reverie" rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses, which slightly softens the impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is potent and consistently drives his actions, from the meticulous decoding to the strategic escape. His interiority is shown through his focused choices under pressure rather than extensive reflection, which fits the story's pace. The character reads as a coherent individual, with his defining trait of strategic patience demonstrated credibly in the climax. A minor weakness is that his competence feels nearly absolute, with internal conflict being less about contradictory impulses and more about overcoming external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in the backstory of betrayal. Her synesthesia provides a unique lens for her interiority, externalizing her quest in a concrete way. However, her internal conflict sometimes relies on summary ("fracturing her focus but fueling the fire") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment, and the final realization borders on an articulated theme rather than a purely earned emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her final transformation from thief to guardian is an asserted epiphany rather than a dramatized internal struggle. The line "she wasn't just a thief anymore, but a guardian" functions as a diagnostic label that summarizes her change too neatly, lacking the friction of a more complex emotional process for such a profound shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation, internal conflict, and backstory forming a cohesive and compelling portrait. Elias's method of "dramatic narration" is a brilliant tic that externalizes his internal struggle against despair, making his voice both unique and purposeful. The change in his final resolve is earned through specific, on-page catalysts, fulfilling the 9+ test for earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and compelling, stemming directly from the inciting betrayal. However, her core traits—phobias and adaptiveness—are more stated than fully dramatized. Phrases like "firmly adaptive" and her fears turning into "foresight" read as convenient authorial labels rather than earned internal states. The final epiphany feels slightly unearned, more of a neat summary than a messy, embodied realization mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and tightly integrated with her actions. The interiority avoids cliché, presenting her obsession not as frantic energy but as a focused, insistent state, a compelling internal contradiction. The way her actions—crunching slate underfoot to mimic home, retelling silences—are directly tied to her core drive demonstrates a character whose internal world is made manifest without overt exposition. The final earned stasis feels credible and scaled perfectly to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and effectively drives the narrative from her initial curiosity to her final, altered state. However, her characterization relies too heavily on the label "remarkably composed," which is stated rather than consistently embodied in contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her interiority, while philosophically interesting, often reads as a summary of the theme rather than a specific, personal experience of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation to "thaw mistrust" is clearly established and paid off with a decisive, vulnerable action. His internal conflict between observation and participation is well-dramatized, culminating in an earned character change. The backstory reference feels slightly generic but effectively grounds his motivation in the brief space allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are well-embodied, particularly the ritualistic polishing. The internal conflict is established effectively through his pragmatic skepticism of the Luckometer, which he nonetheless consults. The characterization is strong, but falls just short of the highest tier as his internal state, while consistent, lacks a truly sharp, contradictory impulse acting *within* the climactic moment; his skepticism gives way to validation a little too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is well-established and drives the plot. However, Jax is largely functional, his "obliging" nature preventing any meaningful friction or crucible moment in their relationship. The characters operate in perfect harmony toward a shared goal, which limits the potential for deeper characterization through conflict or contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and well-grounded in his character as a musician clinging to a dying art form. The final shift from being “inspired no longer by mystery but by resolution” provides a satisfying, earned change. However, the interiority occasionally relies on direct labels like “his fervor built to a crescendo,” which slightly lessens the impact compared to the otherwise strong embodiment of emotion through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's internal conflict—the desire for isolated solace versus the terror of impermanence—is sharp and embodied. Mira functions effectively as a catalyst, and her motivation is seamlessly integrated into her archetypal role. The final shift in resolve is earned through the central interaction, with the cost of leaving her sanctuary made palpable, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation to uncover a "swallowed truth" is established early and paid off, and his skepticism provides effective internal conflict. The final revelation of his own past guilt feels slightly too symmetrical with the old man's confession, reading as a neatly constructed parallel rather than a purely organic discovery. The old man functions more as a thematic catalyst than a character, which is acceptable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The chronicle keeper's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong anchor for the narrative. However, his characterization lacks significant internal conflict; he is a passive recipient of a solution rather than an agent struggling with contradictory impulses. The final "change"—gripping reality even more loosely—is an intensification of his initial state, not a transformation earned through a difficult choice, which limits the character's dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict—balancing her own grief with the need to nurture Theo—is palpable. The characterization is strong, but slightly undercut by interiority that occasionally slips into diagnostic language, such as describing her own voice as "adaptive like the melodies she crafted in sessions." This self-awareness feels more like a therapist's summary than an in-the-moment experience, momentarily flattening the emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative effectively. Her actions align perfectly with her stated goal. However, the characterization lacks a potent internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her journey is one of linear discovery rather than a struggle against a flawed part of herself, which keeps it from the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation to "transpose his life" is established, but it verges on an abstract label. The character is more successful when his internal state is embodied through action, such as the "tremor of excitement" while handling the film. The final micro-choice to give Maris the cookie, leaning into the enigma rather than explaining it, is a strong, character-defining moment that solidifies his commitment to his new, orchestrated reality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character concept is strong and the motivation is exceptionally clear, forming the spine of the plot. However, interiority remains abstract ("muffled clarity") and emotions are more stated ("Sweat beaded on his brow") than embodied. He reads as a compelling functionary for the theme rather than a character with deep internal contradictions acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is both specific and abstract, a combination that works well here. The internal state of being "chronologically homesick" is a brilliant, character-particular concept, and his struggle against exhaustion feels embodied and real. The final internal shift to becoming the "conductor" is earned through the on-page process of mapping memories, providing a satisfying arc with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives all on-page action, which is a significant strength. However, the interiority relies heavily on high-concept labels like "labyrinth of self" and "fractured timelines," which feel more like diagnostic summaries than embodied, contradictory impulses experienced in a moment of crisis. The final change to wholeness is earned by the climactic confrontation, but the internal state leading up to it is more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc is emotionally resonant, culminating in a well-earned change. However, the interiority slips into diagnostic self-awareness with the line, "That filament of hush was her core concept," which reads as an authorial explanation rather than an organic thought, momentarily flattening the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve integrity is clear and deepens effectively, driving his shift from passive observer to active resistor. However, his interiority sometimes relies on diagnostic labels like "credibly curious nature" rather than fully embodying the trait, which slightly distances the reader from his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his professional caution and personal loss. His defining trait, being "aromatically cautious," creates a compelling internal conflict that is overcome in the climax, leading to a credible change. However, the articulation of his epiphany—"...the core concept crystallized in his mind"—reads as slightly too diagnostic and intellectual for a moment of overwhelming grief, momentarily pulling back from the embodied emotion so well-established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "verse" the new world is a strong anchor for the poetic voice, but his characterization relies on abstract labels like "ethically playful" rather than demonstrating the trait through action. The internal conflict between clinging to his scarred past (the rope) and embracing a cosmic future is clear and compelling. However, the voice feels more like a high-register literary construct than one born from the "grit of tires," creating a slight disconnect between his backstory and his internal world.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, consistent, and effectively dramatized through the storytelling ritual. His interiority is established through his perception of sound, which feels character-particular. However, the on-page internal conflict lacks sharp contradictory impulses; his grief is a settled state that he is processing, rather than a force that creates unexpected choices in the moment. The secondary characters serve their purpose as a receptive audience but lack individual agency, functioning more as a collective presence to witness Elias's act.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between professional detachment and the desire for empathetic wholeness is well-dramatized, particularly in the moment she actively decides to "subsume those observed pains." The transformation is earned, but the interiority occasionally leans into over-articulated self-awareness, as when her motivation is explicitly restated near the end, slightly flattening the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The characters' motivations are clear but lack complexity. Elias's "shrewd" and "whimsically attentive" traits are presented as a harmonious blend rather than a source of internal conflict that complicates his choices. Both Elias and Mira are rendered as impeccably virtuous, which flattens the characterization and removes potential for tension; their connection is immediate and frictionless, lacking the crucible of a genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation to "graft herself onto this community" is clear and consistently drives the narrative. Her defining trait, "bold sympathy," is effectively dramatized in her decision to propose the search. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract, declarative labels like "luminescent ache of exclusion" and "glowing sorrow," which slightly flatten the emotional texture compared to more embodied expressions of her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and well-integrated with her profession as an illustrator. Her actions are driven by this core desire. However, her interiority, while present, relies on somewhat standard emotional markers ("heart raced," "triumph surged") rather than a truly specific, contradictory internal state. The final acceptance of her fate is a strong character moment, but the journey there could have been sharpened with more embodied internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and poignant, rooted effectively in her ambiguous loss. The internal conflict is well-established, though it leans more towards consistent summary than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The final emotional shift is earned, but its articulation—"...loss was not erasure but a new term..."—verges on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly thinning the emotional honesty of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear, consistent, and deepens effectively through the discovery of the tape. The backstory provides a powerful, particular anchor for his desire to become visible, transforming it from a general kindness into a specific legacy. The final action is a credible culmination of his internal struggle, with the cost of his anonymity felt in his "tentative" steps, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from her initial observation to her final choice. The internal conflict between scientific curiosity and personal fear is established, though the transition to acceptance feels slightly accelerated. The introduction of "circuitously sincere" as a named trait is a bit on-the-nose, reading more like an authorial label than a fully embodied characteristic, which slightly undermines the otherwise strong interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in his art and insomnia. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché. The final paragraph slightly undermines this by summarizing his internal shift ("meaning emerged not in solitude...") rather than letting the change be fully shown through his subsequent actions, which feels more like an authorial conclusion than a character's earned realization in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her central irony—a clairvoyant walking into a trap she didn't foresee—is well-established. However, her agency evaporates at the climax where she becomes a passive victim rather than making a final, meaningful choice, even a choice to fail. The sudden, explained twist in the forces' motivation from enhancing to possessing feels more like a plot necessity than an earned development, slightly flattening the character's final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and drives her actions consistently. Her interiority, however, relies on summary and thematic labels rather than embodied emotion, as seen in the line, "The meaning emerged: the exile was not mere loss, but a forging..." which reads like a diagnostic conclusion instead of a lived insight. Her defining trait ("reactively visionary") is demonstrated, but the lack of interaction with other characters leaves her internal conflict feeling somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and is compelling. Her core trait, "analytically artistic," is demonstrated effectively when she deciphers the cracks in the pavement. However, her interiority relies too heavily on the repeated phrase "trembling certainty," which flattens the emotional complexity of her state from a contradictory impulse into a static label.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with a clear internal conflict between skepticism and compassion that drives the narrative. Her final shift is earned. However, the story leans on labels like "sympathetic skeptic" and "courageously kind" rather than fully embodying them through action alone, and her final epiphany feels slightly too articulate and diagnostic for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and compelling for an immortal character, progressing logically from boredom to a high-stakes curiosity. The internal shift is earned by the story's events. However, the interiority occasionally leans on telling over showing, using slightly diagnostic language like "Her motivation crystallized" or summarizing the emotional state with labels like "Intrigue bloomed" instead of fully embodying it through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena's motivation is sharp and consistent, and her internal conflict between inherited cynicism and a personal need for integrity drives the narrative effectively. The final change is earned by the on-page discovery, but the articulation of her epiphany ("no longer just a con artist, but a man who had conned fate itself") verges on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly softening the emotional impact of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his final choice to descend reflects a credible shift from refugee to restorer. However, his interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels ("quiet urgency," "tempered fire") rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses. The character serves the story's powerful aesthetic beautifully, but feels more like a mythic vessel than a person wrestling with sharp, specific internal conflicts.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation to "discover the texture of memories" is exceptionally clear and consistently drives their actions. Interiority is rendered with concrete, particular detail, avoiding cliché; the irony of the watchman's story "stung, mirroring their own erased history" is a powerful, embodied moment. The final earned stasis, where the character accepts and finds meaning in their namelessness, is a powerful and credible resolution that forecloses the path of reclaiming a past identity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation and internal conflict are clear and compelling. The shift from skeptic to someone mended by a myth is a strong arc, but the final epiphany feels slightly rushed and overly diagnostic. Lines like his crusade being "a quest for this very truth" articulate his change with a bit too much self-aware clarity, slightly undermining the earned struggle of the preceding moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, her core trait of being a "culture shock absorber" and her "orderly intuitive nature" are presented more as labels than as embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure. The characterization relies on summary ("She absorbed his turmoil") rather than dramatizing the internal friction of her dual allegiance in a specific, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation, rooted in her "purposefully curious nature" and the drive to preserve the "last dawning hush," is clear and consistent. Her actions, from seeking the summit to preparing the chem-lab and enduring the vigil, directly stem from this drive. The melancholy adds an embodied, internal conflict, showing an emotional cost to her mission of preservation against relentless expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his identity as a mender of broken things and a provider of guidance. His character is well-embodied through non-visual senses, a strong choice given his blindness. However, the repeated use of "heartfelt" acts as a recurring label that tells rather than shows, slightly flattening the interiority and preventing the characterization from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias Thorne is a well-realized character whose motivations are clear and compelling. His core traits, particularly his "subtle confidence" and "dry wit," are consistent, though they border on being stated more than shown. The story succeeds by grounding his intellectual quest in a tangible internal conflict, culminating in the flicker of doubt that meaningfully complicates his confidence at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a patient, mystical force than a character facing internal conflict. Her "infinite" patience and foresight remove any sense of struggle or doubt, making her success feel predetermined. The story lacks a moment where her contradictory impulses are tested; she is an archetypal guardian whose competence is never truly challenged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear, and her central internal conflict—overriding instinctual panic with practiced calm—is dramatized effectively in the climax. The character arc from near-despair to purposeful survival is earned through on-page action. However, the initial motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is presented more as an authorial thesis statement than a deeply felt, character-particular drive, which slightly flattens the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in the premise. The internal conflict between his father's legacy and his own need for truth is dramatized through potent action—seeking the "hush" in the prison. The final change, feeling the "weight of inheritance lighter," is earned by the on-page symbolic act of confession, making the arc both credible and resonant. The characterization is flawless for a single-character piece focused on interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between scholarly isolation and dawning guilt is well-drawn. His final choice feels earned through the escalating pressure of the hauntings. However, some interiority verges on diagnostic summary ("The debt across lifetimes weighed on him now"), slightly flattening the embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, her characterization leans toward an archetype—the flawless, gentle creator—lacking the internal conflict or contradictory impulses expected at this level. Phrases like "hauntingly optimistic" are stated and reinforced rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible cost, making her feel more symbolic than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to restore her faith is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority is present, but the final emotional shift feels more declared than embodied. The line "her lost faith reignited" is a summary of the change rather than a dramatization of it, slightly flattening the resolution's impact by explaining the emotional state rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is lucid and consistently demonstrated through his actions, particularly his reverence for analog methods. The interiority effectively captures his "quiet ache" and the thrill of creation. The character reads as a cohesive individual, but the lack of any on-page external pressure or contradictory impulse keeps the portrayal just shy of exceptional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted and compelling, driving her precise actions. Her 'wisdom as foolishness' disguise is well-integrated and creates a credible facade. While the story doesn't explore explicit internal contradictions in scene, her commitment to unheard truths under pressure is clearly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative arc. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate self-analysis, particularly at peak moments. The line, "I chose silence to shield you, but it wounded us both," reads more like a tidy summary from therapy than a raw, in-the-moment realization, slightly undermining the "cryptic" nature the story aims to unravel.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered through recurring images. However, her primary attribute, "shrewdly innocent," is asserted twice as a label rather than being fully demonstrated through contradictory actions in the scene. The emotional progression from ache to resolve is earned, but the characterization relies on slightly overwrought, repeated descriptors like "lotus-hearted" which flatten her interiority over the course of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative arc. His interiority is well-rendered, particularly the mix of curiosity and creative ache. However, the emotional state is sometimes labeled with recurring, slightly precious phrases like "pensive mirth" and "pensive delight," which feel more like authorial summary than embodied emotion, preventing the characterization from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the central action, but its explicit declaration—"her motivation clear: to exchange his rigid certainty for the boundless spark of curiosity"—borders on diagnostic summary. While her actions are consistent with her "methodically playful" nature, the characterization of Elias feels more like a functional archetype (the rigid scholar) than a person. The story succeeds in showing Elara's internal state through her connection to the garden and the coin, but could be stronger with less direct telling of motive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation as a "guardian of the untaxed spark" is clear and consistent, driving his actions effectively. His rogue charm is demonstrated through action, particularly the jest, "If thoughts are coins, let's grow a counterfeit garden," which reveals character while advancing the plot. The characterization is strong but lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction or struggle on the page; he reads as very competent and assured, which slightly flattens his arc within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is potent and consistently drives the narrative. The character's transformation is earned through a central, decisive action. However, her interiority occasionally relies on elegant labels like "shyly unstoppable" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within a single beat, which keeps it from the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and potent, directly fueling the central action. The internal conflict between her systematic care and the sharp, lingering "foxglove regret" is well-realized, creating a compelling contradiction. Her character is revealed through her precise actions and her embodied emotional response, culminating in an earned stasis that feels true to her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary trait of "cautious exuberance" is stated more than it is embodied, reading as a label. Thorne's shift from wary opposition to willing participant is too swift and lacks sufficient psychological grounding; the magical resolution substitutes for the difficult interpersonal work, making his change feel unearned. The characters serve the magical conceit but lack complex, contradictory interiority in the key moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, providing a strong initial engine for the story. However, the internal conflict resolution feels externally delivered via the found letter, rather than earned through a difficult, internally driven struggle. The epiphany, while thematically resonant, arrives as a sudden "realization" that solves his problem for him, softening the impact of his character change.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity, and his arc from forging histories to sharing authentic memories is earned. The change feels credible, driven by his choices in response to Mira's presence. However, some emotional states are slightly declared (e.g., "bloomed with fragile hope") rather than fully embodied in his actions or perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from analyzing the table to deciphering the logbook. However, her interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels ("featherly determined," "motivation burned softly") rather than fully embodied emotion or contradiction. The link between her father's lessons and her present actions is well-drawn, but her character arc is more of a cognitive puzzle being solved than a deeply felt internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but overly stated, and her core trait ("softly ingenious") is a repeated authorial label rather than an embodied choice with visible cost or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, her interiority relies on recurring labels like "cheerful gloom" rather than fully embodying a complex emotional state through contradictory action or perception. The characterization serves the theme well but feels more like a thoughtful vessel for the story's concept than a uniquely complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear but is repeatedly stated rather than embodied, reading like a thesis statement (e.g., "his motivation clear..."). While his analytical nature is consistent, the character lacks internal conflict or any meaningful struggle; his perfect execution of a flawless plan makes him feel more like a concept-delivery-system than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and potent, serving as a strong engine for the narrative. Her interiority is consistently filtered through the story's lyrical, elevated style. However, her defining skill as a "tide dancer" and the attribute of being "spontaneously anchored" feel more like elegant labels than deeply embodied traits that create internal conflict or force difficult micro-choices; they primarily serve the established aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's quiet action. The interiority is rich, but occasionally veers into overly articulate, abstract self-analysis ("noctilucent reckonings") that feels more authorial than character-driven. While his final transformation is earned within the story's logic, the lack of a sharp internal contradiction—it's more a gentle yearning than a conflict—keeps the characterization from achieving exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's core contradiction—the hardened firefighter with "gently skilled" hands—is effectively established and embodied. His motivation is clear, but its articulation verges on the diagnostic, as when the text states he is urged "to translate that pain into a universal language." While his climactic choice to open up to Lena is earned by the preceding reflection, Lena herself functions more as a receptive archetype than a character applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is crystalline and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is consistently filtered through the "logical dreamer" lens, creating a coherent character. However, the internal conflict between logic and grief feels more stated than embodied; phrases like "serene upheaval" act as labels rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single moment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desire to reframe her family's legacy. Her interiority is well-established, though the final shift from personal burden to communal mission feels slightly accelerated. The core internal conflict is present, but could benefit from a moment of sharper contradiction before the clarifying discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s motivation is powerfully established and her final acceptance of her new purpose is earned. The characterization is strong, though the key trait "perceptively calm" is somewhat over-relied upon as a label. Emotions are conveyed more through lyrical description than concrete embodiment, creating a slight distance from her internal state during the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her final sacrifice—relinquishing her role—provides a strong concluding beat. However, her interiority occasionally relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounded," "mustered her resolve") and directly states her core concepts rather than embodying them through struggle. The supporting characters are functional archetypes who serve their purpose without surprising, limiting the depth of the relational dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The internal conflict between the "amoral philanthropist" and the "sentimental boy" is dramatized with exceptional clarity. The contradiction acts simultaneously in the climactic moment of hesitation, not just as summarized backstory. The final choice is earned by the established memories and motivations, and the change—his heart "a little less fractured"—is a credible, earned resolution for this length, with the cost of the destroyed artifact felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistently drives the narrative. However, her interiority sometimes relies on elegant but external labels like "alarming poise" rather than embodying contradictory impulses through specific, character-particular perception, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character’s motivation is clear, but his arc from cynical subversive to enlightened healer feels more declared than earned. The interiority relies on diagnostic labels like "half-lit epiphanies" rather than embodying the struggle, making his profound reversal feel intellectually convenient rather than a costly, visceral choice. His "uncommonly serene" nature is stated but not meaningfully tested, and the resolution smooths over the contradictory impulses too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively dramatized through her methodical actions. Her interiority is well-drawn, connecting her personal history to her present purpose. However, the recurring label "esoteric realist" feels more asserted than embodied, a slightly diagnostic tag that lessens the sense of a fully naturalized character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, linking her past failure to her present quest for preservation. Her interiority is palpable, though expressed in language that occasionally verges on the diagnostic (e.g., "forgiveness finally thawed the frost"). The character's core contradiction—a creator seeking to preserve rather than create—is compelling, but the emotional arc is more of a linear progression than a simultaneous internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her "cruel" ability and her desire for purpose is well-drawn. The final change is earned through the ritual and dream, but the reliance on an external dream-figure to articulate the epiphany slightly softens the impact of her own agency in the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his every action from pocketing the tile to performing the ritual. His defining trait of "frugal" precision is well-established. However, his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels like "encrypted devotion" rather than embodied emotion or internal contradiction, which keeps the characterization strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "scheming pacifist" concept is strong, but characterization relies on telling over showing. Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority reads like a statement of principle. Thorne's transformation from a lifetime of armored resentment to catharsis is too rapid and complete to be psychologically credible, making him more of a symbolic vessel for the theme than a character grappling with a genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's core contradiction between his "firmly grounded" nature and the "runaway dream" provides a solid foundation for his motivation. His internal conflict is legible and drives the scene's primary action. However, the final line's summary of a "mending of a wanderer's soul" verges on a diagnostic label, slightly flattening the earned complexity of his final, embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is legible, but the characterization relies on the repeated label “feisty” instead of fully trusting the actions to convey the trait. The final realization—“this mending wasn't mere repair; it was a bridge”—is slightly too diagnostic, articulating the theme rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and fierce, providing a strong engine for the narrative. Her internal conflict between bewilderment and resolve is well-established. The final choice feels earned by the preceding visionary experience, showing a credible change from passive curator to active pursuer. However, the interiority occasionally relies on labels like "persistent unease" instead of fully embodying the state through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence as an arcane linguist is well-demonstrated. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle; her "carefully resourceful" nature allows her to solve the central puzzle without any apparent risk or trade-off. The character reads as a highly effective mechanism for the plot, but a deeper sense of personal stakes or vulnerability is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and psychologically grounded. Her interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly in the contradictory state of being "blissfully aberrant"—unbound yet trapped. The final choice to continue her narrative quest is an earned moment of endurance, a crystallization of her character arc into a form of defiant acceptance, which reads as a powerful and credible resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara's motivation and consistent traits are clear and compelling, driving the plot effectively. However, the story lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses, presenting a character whose decision path is largely rational and unburdened by deeper emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict; she is presented as resolute and competent from the start, with her motivation "burning steady." This diminishes the sense of personal struggle, making the final earned peace feel more like a successful task completion than a profound internal transformation shaped by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the plot from her initial doubt to her final, determined action. While her internal conflict is established, its emotional texture feels more stated than embodied, particularly in moments of high pressure. The action path is perfectly aligned with her core desire, but the interiority could have shown more contradiction in-scene rather than summarizing her crystallizing resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and consistent, and her internal conflict culminates in a well-earned solidification of her identity. The reflection on her vanished mentor adds a poignant, personal layer to her professional duty. However, her interiority relies heavily on repeating key phrases like "sculpt identity" and "preemptively nostalgic," which reads more like a thematic label than a deeply embodied, contradictory emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation to defy hopelessness through creation is clear and consistent, driving every action from his chanting to the final display. His interiority is well-embodied through his "ambient awareness," which connects his professional skill to his emotional state. The character is specific and avoids stereotype, but a few moments of interiority read as slightly over-articulated, such as "defying the gravity of hopelessness," which verges on thematic labeling rather than a fully lived-in thought.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is well-rendered through her connection to the grotto and her method. However, the final dialogue ("Time's texture... is not smooth... but layered") borders on diagnostic label-speak, articulating the theme so directly that it slightly flattens the earned nuance of her character's insight. While Thorne serves his purpose as a catalyst, he remains more of a sketch than a fully realized counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details, such as tasting silences. However, her father exists as a purely functional thematic counterpoint rather than a character, and the final line where her motivation "bloom[s] anew" feels slightly like a narrative label summarizing an internal state that was already evident.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, consistent, and dramatized through his actions. However, his interiority and dialogue occasionally slip into overly articulate thematic statements, such as, "Noise scatters us... But silence, if guided, can gather the soul." This borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the character into a mouthpiece for the theme rather than allowing the idea to emerge purely from his embodied craft.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driven by the concept of "futuristic nostalgia." Her defining trait, "wisely adventurous," is demonstrated through a balance of caution (evading drones) and decisive action (entering the orchard). The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward over-articulated interiority in the final beats, such as "a perfect harmony of what was and what could be again," which verges on diagnostic summary rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the central action, but its articulation verges on diagnostic label-speak ("suffocation of dependence"). While emotion is embodied through trembling hands, the interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts like "loaded emptiness," keeping the character at a slight remove. The final earned smile is a strong beat, but the overall characterization is more conceptually elegant than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation is well-defined by her backstory as a pyramid scheme survivor, making her skepticism and eventual choice to act feel earned. However, her core traits are sometimes conveyed through direct labels like "virtuously mischievous spark" and "motivation crystallizing," which slightly lessens the impact of her interiority. The internal conflict is present but could have been demonstrated with more contradictory impulses in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal transformation from burdened heir to liberated individual is well-executed at the story's close. His interiority is rich but verges on the abstract, as seen in "his face a canvas of unspoken questions... articulating the depth of his introspection." This slightly undermines the embodiment of his struggle, presenting a narrator's summary of profundity rather than a character's direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's core transformation from withdrawn to weaver is clear, but the inciting motivation feels asserted rather than earned. The line "His motivation crystallized" is a moment of telling where showing the internal process was needed. While the "shivering bliss" is a strong emotional concept, its repetition flattens the interiority into a label rather than a complex, embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eliza's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal arc feels slightly too neat. Her shift from "fractured" to "tactfully hopeful" is earned by the events of the story, but the interiority sometimes relies on labeling emotions rather than fully embodying their contradictory nature in the moment. The characterization is strong, but a more complex rendering of her internal state under pressure would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core trait of resourcefulness is demonstrated effectively with the puddle-map. However, the characterization relies too much on upfront labels like "underestimated rebel" rather than letting these qualities emerge purely from action. The interiority is functional but dips into cliché ("Heart pounding"), and Kael's appearance, while pivotal, leaves him as more of a plot device than a character in his own right.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, rooted in familial duty and personal history. Elias’s interiority is consistent, but occasionally relies on telling phrases like "motivation burned quietly within" rather than fully embodying the state. While his defining actions are strong, the internal experience could be rendered with more specific, contradictory impulses to elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her transformation feels more declared than dramatized. The shift from "orderly" to possessing "poetic intuition" happens without a moment of genuine internal friction or contradiction on the page; the story summarizes the result rather than showing the struggle of integration. Her acceptance of the magical artifact is immediate ("She could not resist"), which lessens the impact of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation to "befriend uncertainty" is clear and compellingly established against his orderly past. His internal conflict is consistently dramatized through his hesitation versus his forward action, particularly in the line "uncertainly certain, that attribute clung to him like mist." While the motivation is strong and the final change is earned, the repeated phrasing of his internal state verges on a label rather than a fully embodied contradiction, slightly thinning the interiority at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elarion's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in guilt and professional responsibility. His internal conflict between practiced steadiness and trembling grief is well-embodied in the opening. The character arc from "frantic search" to "balanced wisdom" is earned through the central ritual, representing a credible internal change. However, the climactic insight feels slightly externalized, delivered by a mystical voice rather than fully wrestled from within, which slightly softens the peak of his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear but delivered with some diagnostic language ("turning personal sorrow into a beacon"). Her defining trait, "modestly fearless," is demonstrated rather than just stated, which is a strength. However, Thorne feels more like a thematic object than a character with contradictory impulses; his shift from resistant regret to joyful peace is somewhat mechanical, following the music's direct influence without a deeper internal struggle shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—to find the "mathematics of mercy"—is both unique and deeply rooted in his trauma as an enhanced interrogation survivor. His interiority is made visceral through the proprioceptive enhancement, turning abstract pain into a concrete, textured experience. The micro-choice to tighten the pewter strap is a powerful moment where his contradictory impulses (to remember vs. to avoid pain) are resolved into a single, costly action, earning the story's final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in personal history and a professional calling to honor the overlooked. Her interiority is well-rendered, though it occasionally relies on abstract labels like "anchors of intuition" rather than fully embodied emotion. The final choice feels earned, fulfilling a lifelong quest shaped by the foundational loss of her father, providing a credible change in her relationship to his memory.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") feels more like an authorial theme statement than a grounded, personal drive. While his actions are consistent with his "skillfully observant" trait, his interiority lacks texture and contradiction. He functions more as a competent lens for the plot to unfold through rather than a character with compelling internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative. However, his characterization relies more on this potent philosophical desire than on embodied interiority. While his actions are decisive, his internal state feels somewhat asserted ("his heart pounding") rather than shown through a specific, contradictory perceptual experience, making him a slightly thin vessel for the story's grand concept.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking his past as a failed revolutionary to his present goal of cultural reinvention. However, his interiority, while tonally rich, relies heavily on recurring labels like "burnished sorrow" rather than fully embodied emotion. The conversion of his "skeptics" is too swift and frictionless, making his pivotal influence feel asserted rather than dramatized against meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait as a "mender" directly informs the story's resolution. The internal conflict during the climax, where his doubt threatens to wilt the philosopher's stone chip, is a strong fusion of character and plot mechanics. The resolution of this doubt is articulated with a slightly abstract thematic label ("banished the shadows... with a deeper truth"), which is a minor tell in an otherwise embodied performance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation to seek "the place where explanations failed" is established but remains abstract. The trait "sensibly eccentric" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page choices, feeling more like a label. While her actions align with her goals, her interiority during the psychometric vision is summarized ("sensations flooding her") rather than rendered with the specific, contradictory embodiment expected for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation progresses clearly from survival to a higher purpose, but her interiority relies on abstract, repeated phrases like "scaffold complexity with simplicity." This diagnostic language feels imposed, creating a disconnect between her described "untamed spirit" and her overly analytical thoughts. The emotional arc is functional but lacks the specific, contradictory embodiment needed for a top-tier rating.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, a “gentle obsession” that credibly drives her daily ritual. The link between the external mystery and her internal grief is established, giving her pursuit emotional weight. However, her interiority lacks contradiction in-scene; she is consistently pensive and driven, without moments of doubt or conflicting impulse that would deepen the characterization beyond a single, sustained emotional note.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving her from archival obsession to desperate action. Her interiority is palpable during the retrocognitive visions, embodying the tension between her professional solemnity and unraveling sanity. However, her character reads as slightly one-note; the "solemn" label is asserted but not meaningfully tested by a contradictory impulse in a key moment, making her arc a straightforward pursuit rather than a complex internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is exceptionally clear but presented as a declarative thesis rather than an embodied struggle. The key attribute, "rejects false comfort," is stated multiple times but the internal conflict feels summarized, lacking the contradictory impulses of a character genuinely torn. While his final actions align perfectly with his motives, the interiority reads as an over-articulated diagnosis of his own heroic resolve rather than a lived experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is clear, deeply rooted in a specific past event, and his internal conflict between the detached archivist and the lonely man is masterfully resolved. The final choice to embrace his own feelings is earned by the preceding events, with the cost—the abandonment of his emotional fortress—made palpable in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited duty. The internal conflict, described as “furiously tranquil resolve,” is a compelling concept, though the “furious” aspect is more asserted than embodied in her precise, calm actions. The glimpses of her forebears effectively deepen her connection to the legacy, making her final choice to secure the inheritance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation—to favor listening—is not just stated but dramatized through a compelling internal conflict. The contradiction between his curiosity about the data (pulling him to the siren switch) and his core belief (urging restraint) is rendered in-scene, making his final choice to ring the bell feel earned and resonant. The characterization is specific, consistent, and avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract. His interiority is conveyed through elevated, declarative statements ("a profound action stirred within him: to empathize") rather than embodied contradiction. The character reads more as a thoughtful vessel for the story's theme than a person with complex, conflicting impulses, which limits the emotional depth of his final, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action effectively. However, his interiority relies heavily on repeated labels like "tranquilly perceptive" and "astonished" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. This makes his character feel more like a function of the plot than a complex individual, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, potent, and deepens effectively upon the discovery of Mira's identity. His actions consistently serve this drive. The character's internal state is well-rendered, particularly his "borrowed urgency," but the final transformation into "embodiment" feels more like a conceptual shift granted by the device than a fully earned internal change rooted in contradictory impulses being resolved through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but she functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with deep internal contradictions. Her core belief in the beauty of the incomplete is present from the start and is merely reaffirmed, not forged through significant struggle. The final change is an intellectual crystallization rather than an earned emotional transformation, lacking the friction of a character genuinely battling a conflicting impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks deep internal conflict. His "brazen calm" is presented as a solid state rather than a struggle against fear or despair, which flattens his emotional arc. While his actions are well-motivated, his interiority feels more summarized than embodied, particularly given the stakes of his diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between skepticism and an unacknowledged yearning is established well. However, the characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels like "luminous skeptic" and "academically rebellious spirit" rather than fully embodying these traits through a sequence of contradictory micro-choices. The final change feels earned by the plot, but its articulation—"rebellion academic no more"—is more of a summary of change than a dramatized, felt shift with a visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's unwavering engine. However, his characterization lacks internal conflict; he functions more as a mythic archetype of renewal than a psychologically complex individual. The absence of doubt, hesitation, or any contradictory impulse makes his journey feel predetermined, flattening his arc into a noble but one-dimensional execution of a task.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Harlan's motivation is clear and poignant, providing a strong emotional anchor. His character is revealed through his connection to key objects, particularly the leaf and the cylinder. However, his core trait of being "intuitively descriptive" is asserted more than it is dramatized, feeling like a label provided for plot convenience rather than an earned, embodied quality, which slightly undermines the authenticity of his internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from remembrance to discovery. The internal conflict of the "blessed pariah" is well-established and creates a solid foundation for her actions. However, the final emotional resolution is slightly over-articulated with summary phrases like "her pariah's isolation softened," which reads more like a diagnostic label than an embodied experience in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's core motivation and internal contradiction ("cautious abandon") are well-defined and drive his actions. However, the execution relies too heavily on declarative labels ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful") rather than consistently showing these traits through nuanced, embodied choices. The final choice feels earned, but the interiority leading up to it is more summarized than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, “benevolently ruthless,” is demonstrated, not just stated, during the climax as she excises the archive's vengeful echoes. The backstory of a crisis actor provides a powerful, ironic contrast that fuels her present actions. The characterization is more archetypal than intimately personal, but this suits the mythic tone and allows her contradictory impulses to land with thematic force.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elowen's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal arc from repression to integration is well-earned. The characterization is strong, showing internal conflict through her actions rather than just summarizing it. The abstract nature of a "mercury-glass seer" is handled consistently, linking her physical form to her psychological state, which pays off in the final image of her "shimmering with purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. However, the internal conflict, while present, resolves with a slightly unearned tidiness; whispering absolution to a mirror is a powerful symbol, but feels more like a declarative statement than a fully dramatized, contradictory struggle. The final emotional state is described as "laced with peace," a label that slightly abstracts the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the scene with purpose. Her internal conflict regarding her own past betrayal adds a necessary layer of personal cost, preventing her from becoming a flawless savior. The "innocently mischievous" attribute is well-dramatized in her interaction with Thorne, successfully embodying a trait rather than just labeling it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and compelling, providing a strong engine for the story. His internal conflict is established but resolves into "profound, golden certainty" a bit too cleanly, missing an opportunity for more nuanced, contradictory emotion at the end. The transformation is more declared than fully embodied in a final, complex choice, feeling slightly unearned despite the ritual's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias's motivation is well-established and consistent, rooted in grief and nostalgia. His defining trait, "intimately aloof," is effectively demonstrated through his solitary quest and the private nature of his final vow. While the character arc is earned, some moments of interiority lean towards diagnostic labels ("a man adrift," "his own unraveling") rather than fully embodied emotion, slightly flattening the prose in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, burning with a “quiet fury” that is both compelling and believable. His interiority is specific, particularly in the core contradiction of a love “so fierce it softened into a murmur.” The character arc, while contained, is satisfyingly earned, culminating in a renunciation of overt force for a subtle, internal form of proof that feels true to his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation rooted deeply in "the geography of loss," a powerful and specific internal landscape. His patchwork nature is not just a label but is embodied in his actions and fluctuating clarity. The internal conflict is vivid, especially the moment of doubt during the waning quarter, which is credibly resolved by his connection to the talismanic censer foot, revealing his hierarchy of values—devotion over despair.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in his personal curse and the dire societal context. His internal conflict between rationality, fear, and the drive for his community's well-being is expertly dramatized, culminating in a high-stakes, embodied choice with felt cost. The portrayal of his involuntary truthfulness as a curse drives character development.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s character is consistent, with his creed of "observed but never breached" isolation providing a strong starting point for his transformation. His motivation—to decode the gesture—is clear and drives the plot. The final choice to pin the flower is an earned culmination of his internal journey, though the final self-description as "eccentric guardian of gaps" feels slightly too self-aware and summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in grief and a multi-generational promise. However, his defining trait of an "empirically intuitive mind" is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized through a unique, constrained action. The final change feels more like a declared epiphany ("charting a course toward connection") than a fully earned internal struggle, slightly softening the impact of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a well-established disenchantment. However, her interiority occasionally relies on summary ("emptiness," "disenchantment") rather than fully dramatized contradiction. Lirian's appearance feels convenient; his shared motivation is declared rather than earned, softening the pressure of Elara's solitary defiance established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    Characterization is functional but held back by abstraction. Motivation is clear but articulated in overly conceptual terms like "capture the density of presence." Emotions are labeled with poetic diagnoses ("scientifically romantic," "equations of the heart") rather than embodied, which creates distance and undermines the intimacy of the confessional moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent: jealousy of his past self propels him to write. The internal conflict between a yearning for youthful ignorance and the jaded knowledge of mortality is well-embodied. The transformation from jealousy to acceptance is earned through the on-page act of writing, but the character's interiority occasionally relies on repeated abstract labels like "jaded wonder" which slightly flattens the specificity of his emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation and interior conflict are clear and compelling. However, her internal state is sometimes articulated through diagnostic labels ("mapping the emotional terrain of her own unraveling") rather than purely embodied experience, which slightly undermines the otherwise strong character work. Silas serves as an effective catalyst, though his perfectly symmetrical backstory feels a bit too convenient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully embodied in the physical metaphor of the crystals, creating a tangible internal conflict. The contradiction between her scholarly identity and her reliance on superstition is dramatized effectively through her choice of tool. The final emotional change is earned through a specific, costly on-page action, making her transformation credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, potent, and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her professional persona and her personal guilt is well-established. Theo’s characterization, though brief, feels authentic to the memory presented. A minor weakness is the slightly over-articulated self-awareness, particularly the label "advises through metaphors," which feels more like an authorial note than organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative, but he functions more as a mythic archetype than a person with complex interiority. The brief moment of self-doubt is noted but resolved too quickly to create the deep, simultaneous internal conflict required for the highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and potent, driving the story's single action. However, the interiority, while consistent, occasionally slips into overly articulate, abstract philosophizing. Lines like "What if clocks didn't measure time at all, but the erosion of certainty...?" read more like an author's thesis statement than the organic thought of a hydraulic clock shepherd, creating a slight disconnect between the character's rugged portrayal and his polished internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively linking her internal grief to the external, quantum-level conflict. However, the interiority feels overly articulated, presenting thematic summaries rather than embodied thought. Lines like "unravel the physics of letting go" and the final "revolutionizing... the hollow space within" read as diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining the character's authenticity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal conflict between being "theoretically rebellious" and responsible feels more stated than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The interiority is articulate but verges on diagnostic self-awareness, particularly in its summary of her father's mindset: "...gambled not from ignorance but from a profound embrace of lucid contradictions." This intellectual neatness slightly undermines the raw feeling of fresh grief.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is potent and clear, and his actions (probing, playing the disc) are perfectly aligned with it. The interiority is consistent, though it verges on the overly self-aware; the character knows his own thesis a little too well. His backstory fragments are well-placed and justify his worldview without bogging down the scene, creating a compelling, if slightly archetypal, figure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine. Her interiority is concrete, rooted in her profession ("peeling back layers of time as if coaxing secrets from reluctant soil"). The final choice to regenerate the covenant is a well-earned culmination of her reflective journey, demonstrating a credible change in stance from passive preservation to active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his defining trait, "desperately jocular," is effectively dramatized in his dialogue. The central internal conflict between his yearning for connection and his elusive nature provides a solid foundation. However, the final emotional shift feels slightly asserted; the description of his "facade cracking" is effective but leans more towards telling than showing the nuanced change within him.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, but the interiority occasionally lapses into over-articulated, diagnostic language like "decode the silent screams within her soul." The final emotional shift to "forgiveness" feels more declared than fully embodied in the scene. While the journey is earned, the final state reads as a slightly too-tidy label for a complex internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in past regret. However, her internal conflict—described with labels like "confidently uncertain"—is more stated than dramatized through contradictory actions. The final character change toward being "unburdened" feels slightly unearned because it comes at a very low and ambiguous on-page cost, softening the impact of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict—the “joyful sorrow”—is well-embodied. The change from hollow observer to active creator is earned through his interaction with Lir. However, the closing interiority dips into diagnostic summary with "mended a fracture in his soul," slightly flattening the otherwise specific emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's core motivation is clear and the "analytically intuitive" contradiction is demonstrated effectively. However, the characterization is weakened by a reliance on the recurring label "volcanic tenderness," which functions as a diagnostic summary rather than an embodied emotion. Furthermore, her primary flaw—arson—is immediately justified as a "rebirth," which reads as safety-hedging and prevents a more complex exploration of her contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. Her defining trait, "quietly rebellious," is effectively dramatized through her choice to reject protocol and invent her own method. However, the repeated use of labels like "auroral sorrow" and "quietly rebellious" slightly flattens the interiority, relying on summary rather than fully embodied emotion, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but stated too explicitly ("to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts..."). While his actions align perfectly with this motive, the lack of a genuine struggle or internal contradiction makes him read as hyper-competent rather than complex. Marco serves his function as a foil but remains a one-note character defined by his bombast.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her grief is palpable, though occasionally stated with labels like "weight of her grief." The guardian is a successful archetype, but his motivation being explicitly stated—"to teach darkness the value of stars"—flattens his mystique into a thesis statement. Elara’s final transformation is earned through the central ritual, representing a credible emotional progression for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, effectively embodied by the recurring action of cradling the chess king. His internal state is well-defined, though his psychic gift is presented more as a given capability than a source of internal conflict. Mira serves as a functional ally, confirming the rebellion's first steps and grounding Elias's mission in a tangible relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between fear and desire is well-realized, particularly through the concept of "combative tenderness." Her actions are driven by this contradiction, making her final choice feel earned. The interiority is concrete, though the visionary reveal of her "siren's call stifled by fear of abandonment" verges on a diagnostic label, slightly flattening the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, particularly the central contradiction between her performer's theatrical narration and her "blank mask" emotional state. This external behavior differing from internal experience is well-dramatized. The motivation to "cultivate lightness" is clear and consistent, but the brief, summarized reflection on her moral ambiguity feels slightly less integrated into the present action than the other character elements.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, flowing directly from her core trait as "aesthetically driven." The internal shift from passive observer to active participant is well-earned. However, the story occasionally slips into diagnostic summary at key moments, such as when "her motivation crystallized," which slightly undermines the otherwise strong embodied experience by labeling it directly instead of letting the action carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation to find beauty in imperfection is clear, consistent, and well-demonstrated through his actions. However, Thorne's characterization relies heavily on a backstory summary rather than on-page action, rendering him more of a plot device than a fully realized individual. The final emotional resolution, "Elias felt no loss," feels overly tidy and sidesteps the potential for a more complex, costly emotional trade-off implied by the "barter" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary trait, "powerfully gentle," is more asserted than dramatized through a choice with tangible trade-offs. The interiority is rich but leans toward abstract summary ("her motives woven from a deep yearning...") rather than consistently embodied emotion. The final change is earned through the story's internal logic, but the characterization lacks the friction of a truly contradictory impulse acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from personal grief to a desire to guide others. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the initial state of loss. However, the transition to her new purpose feels more like a conceptual decision than a deeply felt, contradictory struggle, and Lira functions more as a thematic mirror for Elara's growth than a fully realized character applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but the execution is slightly marred by repetition. The phrase "steadily curious" is used three times, which feels more like a label being insisted upon than an organically demonstrated trait. However, her choice to confide in Theo provides a strong crucible moment, revealing her values under the pressure of potential skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between desperate longing and the need for purification drives the narrative. The final change is earned through her ritualistic actions, especially the tangible cost of shedding her veil. The characterization is slightly weakened by a reliance on high-concept emotional labels like "anguished joy" rather than consistently showing this contradiction through more granular, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to preserve hope is clear and compelling, rooted in her personal history with the Great Fade. Her interiority, particularly the "luminous regret," is a consistent and powerful emotional anchor. Her actions—the precise, ritualistic use of the holoprojector—are perfectly aligned with her "softly deliberate" nature, though this specific trait is stated a bit too repetitively.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between compassion and self-respect is the story's engine. The final choice to quell compassion for Mira in favor of duty feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic label-speak, such as explicitly naming his motivation ("to balance self-respect... with compassion") rather than purely dramatizing it through his contradictory actions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to find closure by reopening wounds is exceptionally clear and drives every action. Her interiority is concrete, and the change she undergoes feels earned within the story's magical-realist logic. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead embodying her drive through specific actions like digging. The final choice to refill the hourglass is a powerful, earned expression of her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is specific and evocative. The character arc from seeker to committed actor is earned. The final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated, as in "goodbye letters became hellos to the self," which reads more like a thematic summary than an embodied, in-the-moment realization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on archetypal language ("moonstruck dreamer") and stated emotions rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. The central internal conflict is described more than it is dramatized in the moment. The realization about stardust feels more like an insight delivered to her than a discovery earned through a difficult internal struggle, reading as somewhat diagnostic ("her trapped creativity was no accident").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his final internal shift is earned, but the interiority relies on slightly abstract descriptions of his "hollowness" rather than consistently showing it through contradictory impulses in the moment. The character arc lands, but the moment-to-moment internal conflict could be sharper. The final sentence, "the void within him sparked at last," provides a strong, earned closure for his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth due to passive agency. He is more of a receiver of the rainforest's gifts (translocation, the gear) than an active force driving events through difficult choices. The interiority remains largely abstract and philosophical; we are told of his struggle rather than feeling his contradictory impulses or embodied emotions in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict reads more as a summary of fears than a dramatized struggle. The pivotal realization, "The leash was her fear, not his chain," is an insightful statement but lacks the on-page friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The guides function effectively as archetypes for this allegorical mode, but their characterization remains purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal arc is well-defined. The contradiction between his desire for the choir's harmonious defiance and his acceptance of the fortress's healing silence is palpable. The shift from seeing silence as "unpardonable" to a "vow" is earned by the discovery of the bolt. The only minor weakness is a moment of over-articulated self-awareness near the end that slightly lessens the emotional impact by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and her characterization as a "diminutive titan" is well-realized through her quiet, deliberate actions. The attribute "regally unpretentious" is successfully dramatized when she feigns the role of a humble curator. While her resolve is unwavering, the absence of any visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in-scene holds the characterization just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and grounded in her backstory as a “coral bleaching witness.” Her interiority feels authentic, balancing professional focus with personal melancholy. The specific habit of tapping rhythms is a strong, particularizing detail that avoids cliché, successfully embodying her need for focus and connection. The final emotional shift to relief is earned by her methodical work throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling internal contradiction of her "awkwardly confident" nature. This is beautifully embodied in her physical presence—"shoulders squared yet toes curling"—and her decisive actions, which contrast with her self-conscious physicality. Her motivation to find "meaning in the mess" is not just a label; it's dramatized through her every action, culminating in a final choice that feels both earned and inevitable, with the clear cost of sacrificing the lull's peace for renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, but her characterization relies more on potent labels (“insurgent grandmother”) than on dramatized internal conflict. Her interiority is often summarized with phrases like “her insurgent spirit flared,” which tells the reader her state rather than embodying it through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority suffers from diagnostic label-speak. Phrases like "somatic markers," "emotional minefield," and "map her inner landscape" read like a therapeutic summary rather than an embodied, in-the-moment experience, which flattens the emotional stakes at key moments and prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is palpable. The central action of untangling the threads serves as a strong physical expression of his psychological journey. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels ("crestfallen spirit," "hollowed by regret") rather than consistently embodying his emotional state through more particular perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the internal contradiction of “serene anger” is effective. However, some character traits feel more like labels than embodied actions, particularly “consciously wild,” which is repeatedly stated but doesn't force a choice with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her core conflict is often stated rather than embodied. The repeated use of labels like "bravely conflicted" and "brave in her defiance" feels diagnostic, summarizing her internal state instead of letting it emerge from contradictory actions or perceptions. The shift from dutiful archivist to revolutionary is compelling in concept, but the internal process is compressed into a moment of reflection that reads more like an epiphany than a grueling, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, rooted in a compelling internal conflict between her pacifist nature and her violent lineage. Her motivation is clear and her final choices are earned. However, her interiority sometimes relies on repeating the story's key thematic phrases ("engraved quiet"), which reads more like an abstract authorial label than a uniquely embodied emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a concise and impactful backstory. Elias's core trait—his "cool head"—is consistently demonstrated through his focused actions amid chaos. However, the internal conflict feels slightly muted; his calm is presented as a static, pre-existing state rather than a quality actively struggled for and maintained against the psychic pressure of the garden and his own grief.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from the inciting call to the final confrontation. Her defining trait, "devotedly observant," is effectively dramatized when she spots the impossible data logs and her cousin's tremor. However, her interiority, particularly the "solemn playfulness," often reads as an authorial label rather than a deeply embodied, contradictory state, slightly flattening her character in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to resolve her guilt is potent and consistently drives her actions. The internal conflict between her fear of the sound and her need for resolution is well-dramatized, culminating in a choice that feels both difficult and inevitable. The final transformation is earned, with the cost of confronting the traumatic memory made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, particularly the demonstration of her "socially perceptive" nature in tailoring the mandala. However, the motivation is sometimes stated too directly ("The motivation burned in her: to discover meaning in the mess"), which slightly lessens the impact of her embodied choices.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in the compelling internal conflict between overwhelming empathy and the need for resolve. However, the characterization occasionally relies on recurring thematic labels like "gentle radical" and "aberrant mercy" rather than purely embodied action, which slightly flattens the interiority. The final transformation is earned, though the speed of its arrival feels a touch convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliza's motivation is clear and compelling, and her synesthesia provides a unique lens for her interiority. The ghost's need for an encore is a solid counterpoint. However, the protagonist's shift from deep despair to buoyant hope during the climax feels somewhat accelerated, making the final emotional state read as slightly less earned than the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and dramatized effectively through her actions. The "affectionate skeptic" trait is well-embodied, creating a believable internal contradiction that drives the plot. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, such as the direct reference to "somatic awareness...that neuroscientists called markers," which feels more like a research note than lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and provides a strong engine for the narrative. The story successfully charts her shift from guardian to herald. However, her interiority lacks texture; the transition from discovery to inspiration ("Inspired, she pressed the fossil...") is linear and lacks the contradictory impulses of a truly complex character under pressure. The final narration, while thematically resonant, feels more like a performance than an earned, internal crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. However, her interiority lacks significant contradiction; she proceeds toward her goal with quiet competence but without a dramatized internal struggle or a moment of genuine doubt. The repetition of "quietly inspired" functions more as a label than an embodied state, slightly flattening the character's internal landscape at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation and attribute are clear and demonstrated. However, the emotional resolution with Marcus feels unearned and overly tidy. After two years of betrayal, his immediate understanding and her instant trust ("To fix us") bypass the richer, more contradictory internal conflict that such a reunion would provoke, slightly cheapening her earned courage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal arc from burdened to serene is well-earned. The internal conflict is vividly rendered through his reflection on the palimpsest promise. The final change feels like a genuine, earned epiphany, but the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, abstract language ("to distill this complexity into essence") that feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on pre-digested labels ("zen mind," "phototropic") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. His journey to understanding is serene and linear, lacking the internal friction that would make his final, earned peace feel more hard-won. The characterization is conceptually strong but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her central trait, “wistfully pragmatic,” is established early and paid off in the final line. Her internal conflict is present, though the expression of it occasionally veers toward diagnostic summary (“the protected vulnerability she wrapped around her heart”). The final choice to envision a new, shared garden is an earned evolution of her character, stemming directly from the initial setup of her isolated gardening.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but its crystallization is articulated with diagnostic label-speak ("to translate that isolation into independence, to forge a self unbound by loss"). This moment of telling slightly undercuts the otherwise well-embodied journey from trembling fragility to empowered resolve, preventing the characterization from achieving flawless integration.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to overcome a feeling of being "adrift"—is clear and compelling. Her character is revealed through her quiet observations and her pivotal choice to engage rather than remain a ghost. The final shift to writing for a "collective heart" provides a satisfying, earned change, with the cost being her cherished anonymity traded for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling internal contradiction of "cautious hope" and "gritty determination." Her motivation is established early and remains the unwavering engine of the plot. The confrontation with Harlan provides a perfect crucible, revealing her core traits not through exposition, but through the quiet, decisive action that subverts his overt power play.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's core contradiction as a "claustrophobic explorer" is well-established and drives the internal conflict effectively. Her motivation is clear, and her actions align with her "prudently adventurous" nature. However, the resolution of her phobia—lifting "like a spell broken"— feels too swift and magical, undercutting the psychological realism of the struggle that was built up so well.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted effectively in the intriguing concept of a face-blind artist. Her methodical nature is demonstrated through action, aligning well with her motives. However, her interiority lacks true contradiction in the moment; her drive to solve the case and awaken empathy is presented without any palpable self-doubt or internal friction, reading more as a stated mission than a felt struggle. The final stirring of empathy feels slightly diagnosed rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and potent, providing a strong engine for the plot. However, her core internal conflict is articulated through the repeated label "nervously confident" rather than being consistently dramatized through contradictory actions or embodied sensations. This diagnostic phrasing surfaces three times, functioning as a summary that lessens the impact of her internal state, particularly during high-pressure moments like composing the query.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to overcome his "nevers" is clear and compelling, and his backstory is integrated efficiently. The internal conflict is present, but its articulation occasionally relies on abstract thematic labels like "pixelated amnesty" and "granular forgiveness" rather than purely embodied emotion. The final change is earned, though the epiphany happens very quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "rewrite his lineage" is clear and consistent. However, his defining trait—a "polished calm"—is asserted more than embodied, reading as a repeated label rather than a complex internal state under pressure. His climactic feeling of "no rage, only that polished calm sharpening his resolve" feels diagnostically told, and the character's final epiphany is articulated with a tidiness that slightly undermines the struggle that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored effectively to the mentor and the inscriptions. However, her interiority, while fitting the lyrical tone, relies on somewhat generalized states ("midnight solace," "adrift in a starry sea") rather than sharp, character-particular contradictions. The pivotal attribute "heals with words" is satisfyingly dramatized in the dream, but the character lacks a compelling internal flaw or blind spot that complicates her quest, making the journey feel more like a steady, inevitable unfolding than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elowen's motivation is sharp and compelling, driving the entire narrative from a point of failure to revelation. Her defining trait—being "guarded"—is effectively established and provides a satisfying internal arc that mirrors the external action, culminating in her heart "straightening." The characterization is strong, though the final internal shift feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in the closing moment, narrowly missing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels. The repeated phrase "anxious elation" acts as a summary rather than an embodied, contradictory emotion, which flattens the character's experience during the climax. Her actions are well-aligned with her role as a "visionary," but she lacks the compelling internal conflict or tangible blind spots expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to “patch the holes in her soul” is clear, potent, and drives every action. Her defining trait, “fiercely gentle,” is effectively dramatized in her non-confrontational approach to Thorne. Thorne's characterization is slightly thin; his shift from cynical dismissal ("Fates aren't toys for idealists") to willing participant happens very quickly, making his motivation feel more like a convenient mirror of Elara's than a deeply earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's internal conflict is compelling and well-dramatized, particularly the contradiction between clinging to the past (the grille cloth) and shielding himself with the emotional distance of an appraiser. Jack’s motivation is clear and his final shift feels earned by the preceding introspection. The interiority is specific, avoiding stock phrasing and grounding his emotional state in his unique history.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies more on labels ("kindly methodical," "haunted ambitions") than on dramatized, contradictory impulses. Her internal journey toward peace is a linear progression of thought rather than a struggle between conflicting values. The emotional resolution, while present, feels more asserted than embodied, lacking the friction of a deeply earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)
    The librarian's motivation—a "quiet desperation" to preserve wonder—is established early and powerfully dramatized. The character's core contradiction, a rigid mechanical frame subject to lunar flux, is not just a trait but the central engine of his method. The climax, where his "unyielding pistons, grew supple," is a superb example of internal conflict resolving an external problem through embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's initial motivation as an inspector is clear, but the shift to a messianic savior is an unearned epiphany. The line, "His motivation crystallized in that moment," summarizes a profound change rather than dramatizing the internal struggle, making the leap feel more convenient than earned. While his actions align with this new motive, the transition lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied emotional process expected for such a significant transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The character's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and sustained. However, the interiority relies on declarative statements ("unmedicated clarity that demanded reckoning," "resonating like a balm") rather than fully embodied emotion. The internal conflict is resolved smoothly through a series of discoveries without a moment of significant in-scene struggle or contradictory impulse, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear but abstract; her "fractured past" is a label that doesn't manifest as a specific flaw complicating her choices. Her internal state is described with dichotomies like "eager hope and guarded doubt," but these don't create an embodied, contradictory struggle in scene. She proceeds with high competence, making the journey feel more like a procedural unlocking than a personal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between the solitary dream and the empire's call is well-embodied in the "mulberry ache." The final choice feels earned as a culmination of internal pressures rather than a sudden leap, with the contradictory impulses acting in scene through her hesitation over the violin versus her methodical divination. The characterization is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative with purpose. The character's unique profession as a "beautician mortician" is well-integrated, informing her final ritualistic actions with poignant expertise. While the motivation is stated somewhat directly ("burned clear"), her subsequent choices—beautifying her own form for death—dramatize it effectively, earning the story's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her commitment is demonstrated through action, but her final transformation feels received rather than earned. The change is precipitated by a magical object's vision, which lessens the impact of her own internal struggle and choice. The repeated label "kindly decisive" also serves as a crutch, telling us a trait that could have been more fully embodied through varied action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-realized. Thorne is a compelling figure, particularly with the "sincerely insincere" attribute. However, the climactic resolution feels slightly unearned; the line "the action as simple as releasing a latch" undercuts the weight of the preceding struggle, and the use of diagnostic phrasing like "protected vulnerability" abstracts the emotion at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority is dominated by abstract concepts ("dissolution," "nothingness") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. This makes the character feel more like a vessel for the story's philosophy than a person experiencing it viscerally. The "scholarly attribute" reads as a label, not a flaw tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, fitting the mythic tone. However, her characterization relies on archetypal traits like "weathered resolve" and the repeated label "Historically reverent," which feel more declared than fully embodied. While her actions align with her motives, the story lacks dramatized internal conflict or contradiction, rendering her more a vessel for the concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the narrative. The arc from “underachieving” to “awakened” is earned through her actions. However, her interiority occasionally relies on labels (“her underachieving nature mocking her efforts”) rather than fully embodied emotion, which slightly distances the reader from her internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and sustained, rooted effectively in the vow to his father. His interiority is mostly concrete, but slips into diagnostic abstraction with phrases like "a veil of honesty masking the tag's deeper pull," which tells the reader the theme rather than embodying the character's contradiction. The final change is earned by his decisive actions, but the story lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting *in scene*—he is resolute from the moment he leaves the pier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear but articulated with abstract jargon like "to wavelength align with her purpose," which reads as a diagnostic label rather than an embodied drive. The internal conflict between "quiet enthusiasm" and "stellar doubt" is consistently signaled but feels more stated than dramatized until the final choice. The concluding action is well-motivated by the plot, but the character's internal journey relies heavily on repetitive emotional tags.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The character's motivation is potent and his emotional journey from heartbreak to purpose is clear and affecting. The shift is earned through his actions. However, the resolution is slightly weakened by Lira's voice giving a direct instruction ("name them all, and find me in the naming"), which feels more told than discovered, slightly reducing the power of his internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his “brittle devotion” and “naive faith.” The internal conflict between his doubt and his persistence provides a solid character arc. However, the repeated use of trait labels—“naive,” “earnest,” “lukewarm”—acts as a slight crutch, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the actions carry the full weight of the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization remains somewhat thin. The defining trait "precisely humane" is asserted three times but never dramatized through a choice with a tangible cost or trade-off, making him feel more like an archetype than a flawed individual. The transformation from warden to community healer is rapid and lacks the texture of internal conflict, making the final resolution feel less earned by character change and more by plot necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between logic and sentiment is the story's engine, and her motivation is clear and compelling. The backstory of her grandmother's tales provides a solid anchor for her "secretly sentimental core." While the resolution is swift, the emotional shift is earned and embodied in the climactic scene, particularly with the unbidden tears that signal the breaking of her rigid control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation to preserve trust is clear and drives her choices under pressure. Her internal conflict between doubt and resolute action, coupled with embodied emotions like trembling hands, provides concrete characterization. The lingering burden at the end offers a nuanced, earned cost for her vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and compelling, but the final emotional breakthrough relies on summary rather than embodied experience. The climactic line, "emotions flooding back in a torrent: regret for lost years, wonder at this twin," functions as a diagnostic label, telling the reader the emotional outcome instead of allowing them to experience Kai's specific, contradictory sensory details as the numbness shatters.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative forward. The characterization is solid but lacks a deeper layer of internal contradiction; his shift from stagnation to inspiration is a smooth, linear transition rather than a struggle between competing impulses dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character's motivation is potently established, and the central contradiction of "mournful eagerness" is a strong anchor. However, the motivation is articulated too directly ("Elias's motivation burned...to restore that lost laughter"), and the triple repetition of "mournful eagerness" functions more as a recurring label than an evolving internal state. This slight lack of subtlety in the interiority prevents the characterization from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in the compelling concept of being "dimensionally homesick." The internal conflict between her feral instinct and the patient resolve of a guardian is well-established. Her final choice to act is earned by the discovery of the pendant, but the interiority occasionally leans on articulating the theme directly ("To make friends with uncertainty, she told herself...") rather than letting it emerge purely from embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is sharp and his internal conflict is palpable, driving the narrative effectively. However, the characterization relies on abstract labels like "stoically sensitive" and "unfulfilled wonder" rather than consistently embodying these traits through contradictory micro-choices. The final change is earned, but the interiority occasionally slips into summary instead of lived-in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation and professional competence are well-established. The central conflict is appropriately rooted in her internal state. However, her self-awareness feels overly articulated, particularly the line "the method was clear in her practical philosophy—by discarding assumptions," which presents the core struggle as a pre-solved intellectual exercise rather than a difficult, embodied act, slightly flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a functional protagonist, but his characterization relies heavily on labels like "ardent" and "resiliently positive" rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. His sudden grand motivation "to reunite what was torn asunder" feels unearned for a deckhand, appearing as a convenient plot engine rather than an organic drive. While his actions are consistent with his stated traits, his interiority lacks specificity, preventing a truly compelling character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, specific, and compelling, driving every action from the inciting incident to the climax. Elias's internal conflict between his methodical approach and his desperate yearning is dramatized effectively through his increasingly forceful weaving. The final shift from seeking a gentle touch to accepting a "gritty, unyielding weave" represents an earned and resonant character change with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her defining trait, "balancedly curious," is demonstrated in her measured approach to the alien artifact. The internal conflict between wonder and the weight of isolation is palpable. However, the character's emotional expression is somewhat limited by the repeated use of "somber marvel," which slightly flattens her interiority into a single, albeit fitting, emotional chord.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align with her established trait of persistent curiosity. However, her interiority is more procedural than personal, focusing on the "how" of her job rather than a deeper internal conflict. The final description of her action as "incidental heroism" is an authorial summary that distances the reader from her immediate experience, slightly cheapening the earned quality of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the vow to his mentor. However, his defining internal conflict—claustrophobia—is repeatedly stated as a label ("claustrophobia clawed at him," "Claustrophobia surged") rather than being fully dramatized as a force that complicates his choices or alters his tactics. The critical moment of resolve ("Elias stood firm, ignoring the closing walls in his mind") is an assertion that bypasses the opportunity to show his struggle and victory over a genuine, debilitating impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compellingly rooted in her past trauma, driving the story's central action. Her internal state is effectively externalized through embodied details like the trembling teacup and, most notably, her heart rate. The choice to use a shard from a shattered object to repair a fragmented one is a strong expression of character, though the direct statement of her motive ("to fetch wisdom from failure") slightly lessens the impact of this otherwise well-dramatized drive.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elar's motivation is exceptionally clear and powerfully embodied; the physical manifestation of his resolve in his glowing copper veins provides a compelling anchor. His internal conflict regarding the cursed diamond is present but subtle, culminating in the visceral cost of enduring the curse's visions. The character's core traits—quiet articulation and deep resolve—are not just stated but are fundamental to the story's final, successful action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in personal loss. However, the pivotal emotional shift feels slightly unearned due to diagnostic language; the line "reshaping resentment into wry amusement" summarizes the change rather than embodying it, weakening the climax. Her transformation reads more as a passive reception of power than a final, difficult choice born from internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority is conveyed through action, particularly the pivotal choice to amplify her music using the locust shell. However, her emotional landscape remains somewhat archetypal, lacking the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization from highly competent to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively demonstrated through his actions. However, the interiority occasionally slips into summary, with phrases like "his motive burned clearer than ever" feeling more like an external narrator's explanation than the character's direct internal experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation to find possibility in silence is established, and his final act of singing provides a decisive character change. However, the interiority feels more poetic than particular; the internal conflict preceding his choice to sing is minimal, making the transformation feel more like a response to the magical halo than a deeply earned, contradictory struggle. The motivation crystallizes abruptly rather than intensifying through mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to the absence of internal conflict or a meaningful flaw tested on the page. The "sanely eccentric" trait is stated rather than dramatized through a choice with consequences. While her actions are purposeful, they unfold without struggle, resulting in a character who demonstrates a concept rather than enduring a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her backstory, driving the narrative with compelling force. Her interiority is rendered with specific, character-particular language ("luminous absence"). The final shift from a desire to capture to a need for release is an earned change, representing a powerful and believable internal resolution with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the interiority relies on abstract, diagnostic labels ("ideas trapped behind the iron bars of her fear") rather than embodied emotion, making the final emotional shift feel more summarized than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "hands-on folklorist" with a "chronically curious nature" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her internal hunger for lost memories compelling her to break routine demonstrates strong, consistent characterization, leading to a palpable sense of earned emotional recovery. The score is capped at 8.8 due to line-level artifacts in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-embodied through her involuntary backward steps versus her determined mentorship. However, her dialogue tends towards direct statement rather than subtext ("You think exile defines you? It doesn't."), which slightly flattens the "combative tenderness." Lir functions more as a catalyst for Elara's change than a character with independent agency, which is acceptable for this length but limits the relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align perfectly with her role as a generational guardian. However, her interiority lacks significant internal conflict; she reads as a serene archetype executing a duty rather than a person with contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. This smoothness prevents the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a sense of duty into a personal quest for redemption. Her internal conflict between grief and guilt is powerfully dramatized through the act of confession, which is perfectly paced with the ritual. The final transformation to a state of peace is earned and resonant, fulfilling the arc with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation, born from quiet grief and a desire to interpret silence with empathy, is deeply personal and consistently drives every action. His methodical curiosity is well-demonstrated, making his journey feel earned and deeply felt, though direct "contradictory impulses acting simultaneously" are subtly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority sometimes relies on abstract labels like "sophisticated melancholy." The personification of Death as "Mort" feels like an unearned conceptual shortcut, a high-concept intrusion that clashes with the protagonist's otherwise grounded, analytic nature and explains his worldview rather than letting it emerge from his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is established clearly and consistently ("as a balladeer who had always sung for the overlooked"), but its arrival feels more like a declared statement ("Her motivation ignited like a spark...") than a choice emerging from embodied internal conflict. While her actions align perfectly with her motives, the interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses that would elevate it to top-tier characterization for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her primary traits ("warmly inquisitive," "affectionate detachment") are presented as labels rather than consistently embodied qualities. The phrase "affectionate detachment" in particular feels overly diagnostic and intellectualizes her experience rather than dramatizing it. While her internal arc—a deepening of purpose—is earned by the diary's revelations, she functions more as a lens for Thorne's story than a character with compelling internal contradictions in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully clear and consistent, rooted in a specific professional lens warped by grief. His interiority is concrete, though it occasionally veers into diagnostic self-awareness with phrases like "spooled wholeness." The contradiction between his scientific methodology and his intensely personal, emotional goal creates a compelling internal conflict that is sustained until the final, earned moment of quiet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, directly tied to her unique limitation (face blindness) and her artistic identity. Her interiority is concrete, especially her navigation of the world through texture. However, the discovery of the book provides a solution that is almost too perfect, which slightly lessens the earnedness of her final internal shift. The line "here was a mirror to her own struggles" verges on diagnostic self-awareness that could be shown more subtly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving her from solitude to the precipice of communal adventure. Her interiority, however, relies on some familiar phrasing like "diligently curious" and "unquenchable curiosity," which slightly softens the specificity of her character. The core conflict between her "sociable isolation" and desire for camaraderie is well-stated but not fully tested through a contradictory choice within the discovery scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is well-established as a deep-seated need to understand repair, but her internal conflict is more reflective than actively dramatized. The pang of nostalgia for the girl who "believed she could lock away sorrow" is a compelling touchstone, yet the journey feels more like a serene fulfillment than a struggle against contradictory impulses. The final transformation is earned by her actions but lacks the visceral cost of a choice made under extreme pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The characters' motivations are clear but lack dimension. Elias is a benevolent plot device, and the Grovekin's shift from fearful individualism to collective action is asserted rather than dramatized through meaningful internal conflict or interpersonal friction. Lira is named as a leader, but her agency is limited to voicing a foregone conclusion, making the group's change feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and evolves compellingly, anchored in her solitary duty and catalyzed by the puppet head. The shift from a passive custodian of doom to an active purveyor of mercy is earned. However, the articulation of her motive—"to whisper a lullaby... a soothing balm"—verges on overly-neat, diagnostic self-awareness, slightly softening the raw, embodied discovery of her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is very strong, with a clearly dramatized internal conflict between reluctance and duty. The shift from resentment to acceptance is earned, especially through the small moment with the merchant child. The arc feels complete and the final cost—the acceptance of her bounded life—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority becomes too diagnostic. The epiphany and subsequent dialogue with Lila are overly articulate, verbalizing the story's themes in a way that feels less like an authentic emotional breakthrough and more like a summary. The line "like polymers that won't bond" is a prime example of this thematic label-speak, which undermines the realism of a difficult conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action of the story. The interiority is concrete when linking the "quantified voids" to her specific past (orphaned beginnings, absent parents), making her quest feel personal. However, the character's internal conflict sometimes relies on abstract labels ("unspoken regrets," "self-doubt") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. However, the resolution feels slightly too articulated; the internal process of turning remorse into "polished lessons" is explained rather than fully embodied, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the earned feel of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her characterization relies on repeated, abstract labels ("empathetically decisive," "vigorous tenderness") rather than earned, embodied action. Her primary internal conflict—fear of rejection—is stated and then resolved instantly, deflating any sense of personal stakes. The secondary characters are archetypes who exist only to be won over, lacking interiority or meaningful resistance, which makes the protagonist's success feel predetermined and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is compelling and drives the narrative, and the final transformation is earned by a decisive action. However, the interiority occasionally slips into a detached, expository mode. Lines like "The method was synaptic plasticity..." read less like a character's internal thought process and more like an author's note explaining the concept, which slightly weakens the otherwise specific and embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is established clearly and drives the plot, but her primary character trait—being "prism-minded"—is more asserted than dramatized. The text states her thoughts "refracting the chaos into patterns," but this feels like a label rather than an embodied process shaping her micro-choices within the grotto. Her internal state is consistent but lacks compelling contradiction or a complex emotional arc beyond "discovery" and "resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving every action on the page. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels like "symphonically minded" and "empathy in motion" rather than showing these traits through more granular, contradictory thought. The character reads as a competent vessel for a concept rather than a person with palpable internal conflict in the moment of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation and internal state are clear and consistent, effectively using chess as a coherent metaphorical lens for his worldview. The character's core trait, precision, is demonstrated rather than merely stated. However, the internal conflict lacks a dramatized contradictory impulse; his journey from "hopeful melancholy" to clarified purpose is a smooth, linear progression rather than a struggle between competing internal desires on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align perfectly with his pacifist philosophy. However, his interiority often slips into abstract, diagnostic summaries of his own beliefs (e.g., "he could map the path to empathy"). The character feels more like a vessel for a concept than a person with contradictory impulses, and his final emotional shift is stated ("his pacifist soul deepened") rather than fully embodied in a complex, on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict—ambition versus sensory vulnerability—is well-established. Her emotional progression during the climax is embodied effectively ("staggered back, eyes watering... knotted her gut"). The character change is earned, but the final articulation of this change leans slightly into summary ("her ambition tempered by newfound hush"), which softens the impact of an otherwise strong and specific arc.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, and her actions align with her "intrepid" label. However, her interiority relies on stock phrases like "Her heart raced" and the final revelation is delivered via an external vision rather than an earned internal synthesis. The characterization is functional and consistent but lacks the depth of internal conflict or contradiction that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions are aligned with it. The discovery of the patch provides a solid moment of embodied emotion, connecting him to the human cost of the disaster. However, the characterization remains largely on a professional plane, lacking significant internal conflict, and key attributes like being "rapidly adapting" are stated rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with it. Her interiority is well-rendered through the lens of her synesthesia, making her perception of the world concrete and specific. However, the character functions more as a perfect vessel for the story's theme than as a person with internal contradictions; her motivation is pure and unchallenged, which limits the potential for deeper complexity or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her "unbreaking" will and the vulnerability required for redemption is well-earned by the climax. However, the interiority occasionally relies on slightly too-articulate diagnostic language ("motivated by the sharp clarity that only failure's harvest could bring") instead of purely embodied experience, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poignant, rooted in a desire to systemize the emotional chaos that orphaned her. Her defining trait—borrowing personalities—is not just stated but demonstrated in-scene by channeling the astronomer, which directly fuels the climax. The final realization is earned through a painful, embodied internal conflict, fulfilling her arc with a credible, costly change in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation and transformation are clear and compelling, moving from jittery routine to resolved purpose. However, the interiority relies on abstract, thematic language ("navigate the fade from memory to myth") that feels more authorial than personal. Master Thorne’s dialogue, in particular, functions as a direct statement of theme rather than natural speech, slightly flattening the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between doubt and belief drives the narrative effectively. The final realization is earned, but the concluding sentences slightly over-summarize the epiphany ("...urging healing"), somewhat flattening the more powerful, contradictory insight that she constructed a belief to avoid her own pain.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, culminating in a final choice that feels both inevitable and costly. Her shift from wistful stasis to focused action upon discovering the puzzle is a well-executed micro-choice. The characterization is strong, though the interiority sometimes relies on recurring adjectival phrases ("stoically sparkling") rather than evolving embodied states, which holds it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving him from the forge to the mine. The contrast between his "meek" exterior and "quietly determined" interior is established but not fully dramatized; the internal conflict is more stated than shown through contradictory impulses in a moment of crisis. His final actions are well-supported by his established character, but the interiority sometimes feels narrated with a grandeur that sits slightly apart from the meek blacksmith persona.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies effectively, culminating in an earned change. The character's interiority is mostly concrete, though the crucial trait "cyclically spontaneous" feels more like an asserted label than a dramatized, contradictory impulse. While the final emotional weight lands, the path to it relies on a trait that is stated rather than fully embodied within the scene's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias Thorne's characterization is exceptional. His established reticence and observant nature create a powerful contrast for his final, connective act, making his internal shift from solitary skipper to guardian of a tradition feel earned and profound. The internal conflict is dramatized through his quiet, deliberate actions rather than summarized, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Herald’s motivation is clear, but the central internal conflict—the "shadowed elation"—is what truly elevates the character. This contradiction is consistently embodied in his laughter and actions, culminating in a poignant acceptance of his own obsolescence. While the motive to "shape a new dawn" is somewhat abstract, his reaction to the prophetic glimpses makes his internal state concrete and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict between her inherent caution and the heart's new vitality is well-drawn. The transformation is earned through the story's central symbolic action. The interiority is specific and evocative, but a final summary of her realization—"the quietly explosive truth settling in her chest"—verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority occasionally slips into abstract, authorial phrasing ("angular deviations from the true north of joy") that feels less like a character's thought and more like a thematic statement. The internal conflict is present but lacks a sharp, contradictory impulse in a key moment. His final emotional state is registered with a "faint smile," a slightly thin payoff for the preceding metaphysical breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and potent, providing a strong narrative engine. However, her characterization leans more toward an archetype—the selfless savior—than a person with compelling internal contradictions. Her "scattered memory" is presented as a condition that is overcome with convenient smoothness during the climax, rather than a flaw that forces difficult choices or creates tangible setbacks in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a "compassionate recluse" is clear and consistent. However, his internal conflict is more described than dramatized, and his final epiphany is delivered as a diagnostic summary ("the mistake had chosen him... to remind that true connection hides..."). The shift from isolated compassion to embracing a "quiet revolution" feels earned conceptually, but lacks the embodied struggle of a character whose contradictory impulses truly act in-scene under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and dramatized through specific actions like guerrilla gardening and the bread ritual. Her internal conflict—guilt seeking "tenuous absolution"—is palpable and grounds the narrative's emotional stakes. The characterization is strong because her abstract goal is translated into concrete, sensory acts, culminating in an earned, quiet shift in her internal state rather than a grand epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization is functionally flat. She exists as a perfect instrument for her role, embodying "gently meticulous" without the friction of internal conflict, flaw, or a difficult trade-off. The memory of her own vow is a good touch, but it reinforces her competence rather than revealing a complex interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is split between a clear, compelling loyalty to her father and a more abstract, slightly overwrought desire "to capture the sound of trust breaking." While her steadfastness is demonstrated through action, the interiority around her core goal feels more like a thematic label than an embodied drive, particularly the clunky phonograph metaphor. The character’s actions are consistent and drive the plot, but the stated internal motivation lacks the same grounded credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation as a "luminous skeptic" is well-established and compelling, providing a strong internal conflict. However, her final change feels somewhat unearned because the resolution is delivered via direct, philosophical explanation from the mist-weaver. This expository dialogue lessens the impact of her personal journey, making the final shift feel more like an acceptance of a stated thesis than a hard-won internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict between the drive to create and the pain of memory is well-established. However, the interiority occasionally slips into over-articulated, diagnostic language ("rectifying his self-imposed exile," "uncork the suppressed creativity"), which lessens the emotional immediacy. The final choice feels earned, but the expression of it is slightly blunted by this self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is compelling and consistent, driving the plot from her internal desire to a concrete quest. The confrontation with Kael works well, using her internal "ache" and the external wilting leaves to show her resolve. However, the final change is somewhat summarized; the line "Elara emerged transformed" tells rather than shows the culmination of her emotional arc, slightly blunting the impact of an otherwise strong character piece.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, his characterization relies more on elegant summary ("his spirit a quiet forge of sound") than on dramatized internal conflict or difficult on-page choices. He functions as a competent, near-flawless artist executing a plan, which slightly mutes the sense of personal struggle within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to resolve his inner static is clear and compelling, rooted in his core function as a caretaker. The internal conflict between his nostalgic "frailty" and his programming is dramatized effectively through his decision to initiate the burn. The final change is earned, though the "subroutine prayer" feels like a slightly dissonant, overly anthropomorphic detail for an otherwise well-conceived android consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation, "to prove that listening heals," is overly thematic and lacks personal stakes, rendering her more of a symbolic catalyst than a complex character. Her defining trait of "sandstorm calm" is consistently applied but feels like a static label rather than a dynamic internal state shaped by conflict. While her actions align with her motives, she undergoes no meaningful change herself; the story proves her right without testing her in a way that reveals deeper contradictions or flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is potently established and drives the plot. However, her interiority sometimes defaults to articulating the story's theme directly (e.g., "to encrypt vulnerability as strength"), which reads more like a diagnostic label than an embodied, contradictory internal conflict experienced under pressure. Her competence is well-drawn, but a deeper sense of struggle or a moment of genuine doubt would have elevated the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is potent and viscerally tied to the inciting incident, driving the narrative with credible force. The internal state of being "adrift" is well-established and paid off by the resolution. However, his interiority sometimes relies on slightly generic phrasing like "holes in his soul," and the leap to a specific coffee-ground ritual feels less rooted in his established character as a lantern lighter and more like a convenient plot mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elar's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent. The concept of a "tranquil blaze" is a strong anchor for his interiority. However, the characterization lacks dramatized internal conflict; he is presented as fully resolved from the start, which makes his journey feel more like a flawless execution of a plan than a struggle that tests his limits or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, with Elara's motivation driving the narrative and her relationship with Thorne developing through the clever mechanism of "agreed upon lies." Thorne's archetype as the mysterious mentor is elevated by his specific actions and measured reveals. The final change in Elara is earned, but a line like "yours is the first curiosity that feels like homecoming" borders on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly over-articulating the emotional subtext at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is explicit and consistent, but its articulation—"to translate isolation into independence"—reads as overly diagnostic and abstract. While her final change is earned through the central action, her defining trait of "charmed skeptic" is resolved before the main conflict begins, flattening the potential for in-scene internal contradiction. The description "tragically radiant" feels like an external label rather than a fully embodied state that influences her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and the central internal conflict—betraying her own long-held loyalty to achieve freedom—is dramatized effectively through the ritual. The character arc is complete and earned. However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstract, diagnostic language like "the unfinished forgive itself," which slightly distances the reader from a fully embodied emotional experience at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is profoundly compelling, rooted in her sister's suffering and escalating to a profound self-sacrifice. Her internal conflicts and emotions are embodied and specific, driving her decisions with genuine cost. The final act of offering her own echo feels deeply earned by her prior causality and character-specific traits.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, Elara's interiority lacks contradiction; she reads as a highly competent practitioner of her art, but the personal struggle or flaw that would give her more depth is absent. Her defining trait is her carefulness, which is demonstrated, but she never seems tempted by haste or doubt, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hiroshi's motivation to appreciate "unseen efforts" is clear and consistent, effectively grounding his philosophical nature in the tangible craft of net-mending. His interiority is rich, but occasionally veers into overly articulate summary, as when his philosophy is stated directly. The character is well-realized, though his internal conflict is more of a meditative challenge than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives the plot from start to finish. Her actions directly reflect her stated goal to debunk myths with facts. However, her interiority remains functional rather than deeply textured; her emotional state is often summarized or conveyed through simple physical tells like a "quickened pulse" rather than embodied with unique complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is fierce and consistent, driving the narrative from his isolation. His internal state is well-embodied in the storm, but the story occasionally resorts to telling us about his development ("His character deepened in this isolation") instead of letting micro-choices reveal it. The final acceptance of his lonely role is earned, but the internal contradictions could have been dramatized with more moment-to-moment friction.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. The character's internal conflict between worn ambition and raw hunger is well-established. The final emotional release is earned, though some of the interiority ("alchemized into purpose") feels slightly over-articulated, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's "logically emotional" nature is a strong concept, driving his action to protect the artifact. While stated clearly, the story occasionally tells this internal synthesis rather than dramatizing the active, contradictory impulses within a single beat. The crypt keeper serves a functional but brief role.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively dramatized through her contrast with Thorne. His transformation from impatient fury to quiet focus is a strong "show, don't tell" moment for the story's central character arc. The characterization is slightly weakened by relying on repeated adjectival phrases ("softly purposeful") rather than embodying the trait through varied action, which makes the interiority feel more labeled than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.5)
    Characterization relies too heavily on diagnostic labels like "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability" instead of dramatizing these states through contradictory action. Elias's motivation is clear, but his arc pivots entirely on an external, supernatural event rather than an internal struggle resolved through choice. The final change is legible, but the internal mechanics leading to it feel summarized, particularly the direct statement that his vulnerability "cracked open" after the vision fortified him.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal arc from passive guilt to active responsibility is well-realized. Thorne serves as an effective, understated catalyst. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated interiority, such as "the core concept of second opinions stirring in his mind like a gear catching," which feels more like authorial summary than authentic thought process under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, anchored in her “steady curiosity” and the desire “to ring a bell no one hears yet.” Her interiority is specific and her actions align perfectly with her established traits. The brief mention of doubt (“Doubts gnawed like acid”) feels slightly underdeveloped, creating a competent but less-conflicted protagonist; a more tangible on-page struggle against that doubt would have elevated the characterization from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp, consistent, and provides the engine for the entire narrative. Her defining choice to lie is well-grounded in her established "unquenchable motivation," and her evolution from curious archivist to "secret guardian" feels earned. The internal conflict between professional duty and the pursuit of hidden truth is dramatized through her actions, culminating in a final choice that carries a clear, felt cost of complicity and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear but suffers from being overtly stated rather than consistently embodied. The line "her motivation was always to map empathy onto action" is diagnostic label-speak that summarizes her core trait instead of letting it emerge through choice. While her competence is established, she lacks a compelling internal conflict or flaw, making her actions feel pre-determined and robbing the climax of some tension. The fishermen are defined by their pain, serving more as thematic vessels than complex characters.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, driving the narrative from its intriguing premise to its quiet resolution. The internal conflict is mostly well-handled, particularly the tension between her morbid quest and her emergent empathy. However, the character's self-awareness sometimes becomes too articulate, bordering on diagnostic, as with the line, "A fold in patience, she called it," which slightly flattens the embodied struggle into a neat label.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her interiority is established, but the interaction with Liam feels overly symmetrical. His character serves more as a perfect thematic mirror than an individual, and their dialogue has a self-aware, therapeutic quality that feels less like two strangers connecting and more like a scripted exchange. The line "fostering an intersubjective understanding" is a key example of diagnostic language that undermines the scene's emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elar’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative arc. The internal conflict between his duty and the stated fear of failure provides sufficient depth for this length. The character trait "strangely honest" feels slightly more like an applied label than a trait that actively constrains a choice with costly trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal contradiction. She remains "perceptively calm" and "earnest" without facing a moment that genuinely tests this composure. The story tells us her motivation ("to transmute pain into a masterpiece") more than it dramatizes the struggle or cost of holding it, resulting in a somewhat flat affective arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on the repeated label of "weathered innocence" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The final change to peace feels more like an intellectual acceptance than a visceral, hard-won shift born from an on-page struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, rooted in the specific contradiction of being "precognitively forgetful." His actions, like shifting from chalk to driftwood, are driven by this core trait. The characterization is slightly weakened by the final line's assertion that he is "no longer entirely forgetful," which summarizes the change rather than allowing his new state to be fully embodied by the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but the "sage" archetype is resolved through a convenient epiphany rather than a deeper, earned struggle. His core "luminous ache" is repeatedly labeled rather than fully embodied through contradictory action, making his internal state feel more declared than dramatized. The transition from vexed tinkerer to enlightened master happens too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization relies heavily on assertive labels like "decisively kind" rather than showing this complexity through contradictory impulses in the scene. Elena's emotional arc is more compelling, moving from pained regret to peaceful acceptance. The character work is strong but lacks the subtle internal contradictions that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. Her actions as a scholar are consistent and believable. However, her characterization is slightly flattened by the repeated authorial label "quietly deliberate," which tells rather than shows the trait, and her "budding" status feels at odds with her rapid, solitary success in solving an ancient cosmic mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her characterization relies too heavily on descriptive labels like "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" rather than demonstrating these contradictory traits through action. Her internal conflict is stated more than embodied, particularly through the repeated, diagnostic phrase "cleft in certainty." The final emotional shift toward acceptance feels somewhat abrupt, more of an asserted epiphany than a transformation earned through a crucible of contradictory impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established, stemming from her fire-related trauma and creating a compelling drive to "share light without using fire." Her transformation from isolated watcher to active beacon is earned through the story's central actions. However, the interiority occasionally feels overly articulated, as when she identifies the sea glass as embodying "a core concept she had long chased," which reads more like a thematic summary than a raw, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning" is clear, but her interiority sometimes relies on summary over embodied experience. The climactic decision is catalyzed by an external symbol (the icicles) rather than a dynamic interplay with Kai, slightly weakening the sense of earned action. Phrases like "vulnerability wrapped around her like a protective shroud" border on diagnostic self-awareness rather than feeling the contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s internal conflict is clear, and his motivation to collect hopes provides a strong, character-particular engine for the plot. The transformation from doubt to purpose is earned through the central ritualistic action. The characterization is slightly weakened by a tendency towards abstract labels for his emotional state ("Elias was a conflicted soul"), but his choices and the final earned change are compelling and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth. She is presented as a competent hero who executes a plan without internal conflict, doubt, or a meaningful struggle. Her "whimsical" nature is stated more than it is embodied in contradictory choices, and her triumph feels inevitable rather than earned against personal or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and emotionally resonant, driving every action of the ritual. Her interiority is revealed through embodied endurance—"numb yet steady" fingers, "a statue of endurance"—rather than abstract labels. The final shift from being "hollowed" by grief to carrying a map is earned through the painstaking, on-page process, representing a credible reconfiguration of her internal state with a clear physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and deepens effectively, connecting his craft to his internal state. The link between his personal grief and the abstract goal to "store wonder" is established, though the final catharsis remains more conceptual than embodied. His reflective nature is consistent and drives his actions convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to her core state of being—her fractal curse. Her interiority, while more philosophical than viscerally emotional, is specific and consistent with the story's "whalebone reverie" tone. The transformation from seeing her state as a "trap" to a "loom for universal truths" is an earned micro-change, a shift in perspective that feels significant without requiring a dramatic external action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict is dramatized with specificity through the “crystallized time” device. Her character is revealed through her practical, resilient response to grief. The story avoids sentimentality, but a slight deduction is warranted for the over-articulated nature of her motivation and Marcus’s advice ("harvest it, or it harvests you"), which reads more like a thesis statement than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation to confront regret is clear and compelling, and her final choice to bargain with stories rather than attempt to reclaim the past feels earned. The ghost is an effective externalization of her internal conflict. The characterization is strong, only slightly softened by the abstract nature of her initial "ambitions" before they are concretized by the camera wheel.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but articulated with thematic labels like "equations for hope" rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her interiority feels summarized ("stoic wonder," "methodical mind") instead of embodied, which flattens the character's internal experience. While her actions are consistent, the characterization lacks the specific, contradictory life needed for the highest echelon, reading more as a vehicle for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his final action aligns with his introverted nature. However, the interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labels like "the weight of unspoken longings" and "motivation swelled again," which tells the reader his emotional state rather than embodying it through more contradictory or specific perceptions. A more powerful rendering would show these feelings through action and sensory detail rather than summarizing them so neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the opening sentence to the final epiphany. The internal conflict—the tension between his self-perception as a seeker of external truths and the dawning awareness of his own self-deception—is well-handled. The only slight weakness is the articulation of the final change; phrases like "hindsight clarity washed over him" feel slightly too diagnostic, telling us the result rather than fully embodying the final moments of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is lucid and consistently drives the narrative. However, Elias functions more as a vessel for the story's potent concept than as a character with compelling internal contradictions. His defining trait of being "infinitely patient" is stated rather than tested, which flattens potential for internal conflict and makes his success feel inevitable rather than hard-won against personal limits.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation to "understand the geography of healing" is clear and consistent, driving his actions from wandering to the micro-choice of unraveling the thread. The interiority is rich, but occasionally veers into overly articulate, authorial summary rather than raw character thought (e.g., "as if to map the fragile boundaries between life and loss"). The final change is an earned insight, but his primary internal conflict—choosing the garden over escape—is reported rather than dramatized, slightly softening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elarion’s motivation is intensely clear and his actions are consistent with it. The internal conflict between intellectual conjecture and desperate toil is present, culminating in an earned emotional shift. However, the characterization is slightly flattened by the repetitive labeling of his core process as "hypothesizing" rather than fully embodying it through more varied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a compelling backstory. Her interiority is concrete, particularly in her connection to objects like the sand and coin. The primary weakness is a tendency toward over-articulation; her thoughts and dialogue sometimes state the theme directly ("to prove that scars can sing"), which feels less like raw interiority and more like authorial summary, slightly undermining the character's organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and compellingly layered, tying personal grief to a communal problem. However, the characterization itself relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses. Elara feels more like a well-defined archetype designed to serve the plot than a person with messy, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract. Emotions and conflicts are stated with thematic labels like "troubling serenity" rather than embodied in specific, contradictory actions or perceptions, making Elowen feel more like a vessel for the story's theme than a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal state is rendered with specificity ("drawing inward like roots seeking water"). The character arc, moving from personal sorrow to an understanding of collective grief, is earned through his actions. His final choice to write his own poem demonstrates a credible change. Liora functions effectively as a spectral mentor, a catalyst rather than a fully developed character, which suits the story's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, rooted in a specific, tragic backstory. The internal conflict between his diligent, meticulous nature and the chaotic guilt he harbors is palpable. The final choice to confess is earned through the visionary crucible, demonstrating a meaningful change, though the prose sometimes labels emotions ("quiet ache") rather than fully embodying them in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his primary trait, "blithe," is stated four times rather than fully embodied in contradictory choices. The character remains somewhat one-note, lacking the internal conflict or specific flaws that would be tested by the discovery. His progression is more of an intellectual satisfaction than a deeply felt change.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s central contradiction as "groundedly imaginative" is not just a label but is dramatized in her struggle between data-driven modeling and visionary ambition. Her motivation is sharp and consistent, and her final internal act of prevailing over doubt feels earned and potent, providing a satisfying character resolution within the story's tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his transformation from a passive preserver to an active agent of revival is compelling. His diligence, established early, provides a solid baseline that makes his shift into clandestine action meaningful. The arc is slightly swift, but earned within the story’s magical realist framework, culminating in a change that feels both personal and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elena's motivation is exceptionally clear and viscerally rendered, driving every action from sketching to the final placement of the mask. The story excels at showing internal conflict through embodied action, particularly the contradiction of preserving a "warm ache" by using jagged, painful materials. Her process—"grind their edges into fine ash"—is a perfect externalization of her internal state, making her characterization both unique and deeply coherent. The final act feels entirely earned by the preceding ritualistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, and the internal conflict is the story's powerful engine. The final act of renunciation feels earned. However, the interiority occasionally leans into overly articulate, diagnostic language ("my rational rebellion burned cold and clear"), which slightly undermines the sense of embodied emotion in favor of a philosophical thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization relies on recurring thematic labels like "expectantly resigned" rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. The students function more as thematic archetypes representing discord than as individualized characters, making their transformation feel somewhat schematic. While Elias is a strong anchor, the lack of dynamic interiority or complex relationships keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his characterization lacks depth. He functions more as a flawless archetype for the story's theme than a person experiencing internal conflict. His wisdom is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices with tangible trade-offs, making his success feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's characterization is strong, driven by a well-dramatized internal conflict between his motivation to create wonder and his truth-telling affliction. This contradiction acts in the scene to compel his central choice. Lira functions effectively as a catalyst, though her own interiority remains undeveloped, which is an acceptable trade-off for this story's length and tight focus.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a consistent and well-realized character, and his motivation is clear and compelling. His transformation from passive "noticer" to active "guardian" provides a satisfying arc. However, the pivotal moment of his realization is narrated externally ("Unbeknownst to him, this discovery was inadvertently profound..."), which undermines his agency and makes the epiphany feel delivered rather than earned from within.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s internal conflict between her perceived soullessness and the dawning possibility of emotional complexity is compelling and drives the narrative. Her motivation is clear and her ultimate change is earned by the story's events. However, the transformation from "certainty like a shroud" to full acceptance of nuance feels slightly accelerated for this length, and the final realization borders on diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the core concept of "balancedly daring." The internal conflict between his grim optimism and the memory of a folded gamble is not just stated but embodied in his ritual with the dice. The final change is earned through a focused intellectual struggle, making the climax a satisfying culmination of his established traits rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but its articulation—"to prove that strangers remember kindness"—borders on a thematic label rather than a deeply embodied, contradictory impulse. The internal change is earned through the accumulative weight of his visions, leading to a credible resolution. However, his interiority, while specific, lacks the messy, contradictory undercurrents that would elevate it to exceptional; his hope and weariness are presented more in sequence than in simultaneous conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, with a clear motivation ("rescue dying arts") that is tested under pressure. The internal conflict is well-dramatized in the climax, where her decisive action of wedging the lens is immediately followed by a recoil of fear ("No—"), beautifully capturing a contradictory impulse in a moment of high stakes. Her embodied emotion, the "rosewater dread," is a consistent and effective anchor for her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the execution relies more on assertive labels ("neatly inventive," "bleak exhilaration") than on embodied, contradictory impulses within the scene. While his actions align with his goals, his interiority feels explained rather than experienced, making him a somewhat thin vessel for the story's potent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly stated and drives her actions, but her interiority slips into diagnostic self-awareness at the climax. The confession, "fear thrives on silence, crumbles in revelation," reads as an unearned, abstract epiphany rather than an embodied emotional beat. While the internal conflict is established, its resolution feels more like a summarized thesis than a character-specific, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized, providing a strong anchor for his actions. The character is a well-realized archetype, and his resolve is earned through the brief but effective backstory. The interiority, while poetically rendered, lacks a deeper sense of contradictory impulse or genuine struggle; his path to the solution feels a bit too assured, missing a moment of true doubt that would elevate the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and powers the narrative. Her defining trait, "quietly driven," is well-demonstrated through her persistent actions rather than just being a label. The shift to "grief-laced resolve" at the end is earned by the climax, but the phrasing itself is a minor slip into telling rather than showing the complex emotion, which keeps this from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's core contradiction, "emotionally rational," is successfully dramatized. Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between professional duty and personal sentiment (via his grandmother) provides a strong engine for the narrative. The final resolve is earned, showing a credible endurance of his core values despite the emotional cost, which is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character's core contradiction, "stoically sensitive," is well-dramatized through the contrast between his precise, professional actions and his rich, empathetic inner world. The motivation to become an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is a bit too explicitly stated, verging on a thematic label rather than an emergent desire. However, the transformation is earned through the discovery of the inkwell, which provides a tangible catalyst for his abstract feelings, leading to a credible final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative effectively. Her defining traits—logic and calm perception—are demonstrated through her actions. However, the internal conflict described as “dappled—shadowed by doubt yet resolute” is more stated than embodied; the story tells us about her doubt rather than letting us feel its contradictory pressure on her choices in the moment, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation, rooted in deep grief and channeled through his craft, is exceptionally clear and consistent. His internal conflict is palpable, and his actions are fully aligned with his desire to transform his "luminous torment" into "fragile peace." The emotional progression is earned and embodies a convincing journey of loss and integration.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in the visceral backstory of the drone strike. The transition from a hunter of answers to a hunter of men is earned through the story's central revelation. However, the repeated use of abstract emotional labels like "bleak exhilaration" slightly flattens the interiority, functioning more as a thematic signpost than a deeply embodied, contradictory emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and deepens satisfyingly, linking the external quest to her internal "sense of displacement." The final change from a "perpetually surprised expression" to "wonder" provides a well-earned emotional closure. However, her core internal conflict feels more like a static condition than a set of contradictory impulses acting under pressure in the scene, which keeps this shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-established, with his ritualistic behavior providing a strong, character-particular action. The contradiction between his professional deception and personal guilt is compelling. However, the interiority occasionally leans on abstract labels like "guilt manifested" rather than consistently embodied emotion, and the final epiphany feels slightly summarized instead of purely experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias has a clear, consistent motivation and a satisfying arc, but the characterization relies on telling at key moments (e.g., "Elias was uncommonly thoughtful"). The supporting character, Lira, softens a bit too quickly, and her dialogue, like Elias's explanation of the drawer pull, functions more as thematic summary than as natural speech, making the pivotal turn feel slightly declamatory.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is sharp and his internal conflict is well-established through concrete backstory cues. The "merrily melancholic" trait is shown, not just told, through his chuckle and shanty. However, the final resolution feels summarized rather than dramatized, and the explicit articulation of his goal ("to align heart and action") verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The character's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving him toward the climactic choice. However, the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("empathy kindling within"), bordering on diagnostic label-speak rather than a fully embodied emotional experience, which tempers an otherwise solid internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, but her core internal conflict—reluctance versus desire—is more declared than embodied. The repetition of the attribute "paradoxically steady" functions as a diagnostic label rather than an emergent trait revealed under pressure. While her final choice is earned, the internal shift from deep-seated reluctance to acceptance feels slightly compressed, relying on the fortune's authority more than a dramatized internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, driving a focused internal journey. The contradiction between her cartomantic legacy and her desire for simple joys ("tea sets of joy for the cold precision of cards") provides a robust internal conflict. The final change—a lightening of her burden and readiness to embrace motherhood—is earned through the on-page ritual, making her arc feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent with his pacifist nature, driving the entire narrative. However, the interiority, while thematically coherent, tends to rely on conceptual labels ("pacifist heart recoiled," "resolve ghostly") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment. The emotional progression is logical but lacks the granular, embodied struggle that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but its initial statement feels overly explicit ("to understand the texture of transformation"). The character arc lands, yet the final epiphany is articulated with a diagnostic self-awareness ("He felt it then, the gritty silk of change...") that summarizes the insight rather than letting it be fully embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority is more declared than embodied. Phrases like "her mind a forge for subtle intrigues" label her competence rather than showing it through struggle or contradictory impulse. She reads as hyper-competent without the fine-grained internal conflict that would elevate the characterization from a well-executed archetype to a memorable individual.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, rooted in her curse and a defining promise. Her final choice to step into the aurora feels earned by the ritual's success, representing a credible change from "elusive" to active. While interiority is clear, the embodiment of emotion occasionally leans on poetic description ("joy pierced the curse's veil") rather than more granular, contradictory physical sensation, which slightly distances the reader from the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract, high-concept phrasing like "cartography of scars" and "constellations of pain," which can read as overly diagnostic or authorial rather than a raw, in-the-moment internal experience. The final choice is well-earned, but the emotional state feels more declared than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias's motivation to "turn questions into destinations" is clear and drives the plot. However, the characterization relies on repeated descriptive labels like "diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" rather than letting these traits emerge fully from action. The internal conflict is well-established, and the final choice is earned, but the telling-not-showing of his core attribute slightly weakens an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's core motivation to "forge beauty" is clear and consistent. However, the concept of him "molting personalities monthly" is a significant weakness; it's stated rather than dramatized, reading as a label without demonstrated effect on his choices or internal conflict. Marcus is functional as a catalyst but lacks comparable depth, making their friendship feel more instrumentally convenient than emotionally textured within the short timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias has a clear and compelling motivation that is sustained from his initial state of "steely longing" to his final act of "bold interruption." His internal arc from wistful stasis to defiant creation is well-executed and earned by the story's events. The characterization is slightly weakened by the direct labeling of his core trait ("Elias was strategically creative"), which feels more like an authorial assertion than an organically revealed aspect of his personality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, and her core internal conflict between empirical duty and whimsical methods is compelling. The character's resolution—finding resolve within doubt rather than conquering it—is a sophisticated and earned emotional beat. The execution is strong, though the reliance on repeating the phrase "luminous doubt" to articulate her interiority verges on a label rather than a fully embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his grief and guilt. The internal conflict is present, though occasionally stated too directly ("to name the hue of what he could never say"). His actions, driven by this singular focus, feel earned, leading to a credible emotional shift at the end. The characterization is strong, but a tendency toward overt thematic labels in the interiority prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

The resolution earns stasis by confronting flaws with visible emotional cost in the embrace. Flaws complicate choices authentically, avoiding stereotypes through specific navigator traits.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as a clean slate seeker with a dirty past is clear and intensifies through his journey, compelling choices like navigating the labyrinth to confront regrets. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like weeping in wonder at empathy's spark, showing contradictory impulses in his jaded yet wondering heart. The meaningful change in empathy is earned by causality, foreclosing his old indifferent path with felt cost on the page. However, some stock phrasing in reflections slightly flattens internal conflict, as in the whispered regrets that border on therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to reforge the bond is clear and intensifies compellingly, rooted in grief with embodied reluctance shown through trembling hands and tensing muscles during the rite. Internal conflict shines in contradictory impulses, like resisting transformation yet proceeding, earning the final endurance with the cost of shedding her human form. Strength lies in the micro-choice to crush the spices, revealing values with visible tradeoffs; no stock phrasing dilutes the particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation to reclaim lost time is clear and intensifies through ritual actions, rooted in consistent traits like her cartomantic legacy, with embodied emotions in trembling fingers and hitched breath; interior conflict shows in her willing perplexity clashing with revelations, but some diagnostic self-awareness in whirling mind questions feels slightly therapy-speak. The meaningful endurance in mending the saucer forecloses past defiance with felt cost in tears, earning the repentance. Relationships are absent as it's single-POV with no on-page secondary characters, so those bullets are ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation as a steadfast pacifist is clear and intensifies through the ritual, compelling his choices toward compassion without harm; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like recoiling from rage in visions, showing contradictory impulses in facing shadows. However, emotional progression feels somewhat tidy, lacking deeper irrationality or self-deception, as seen in the smooth weaving of pain into understanding without visible struggle. The final renunciation of shadows earns endurance with felt cost, but flaws like stock phrasing in mantras slightly flatten authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation to understand transformation is clear and rooted in his philanthropic traits, compelling choices like gathering the bottles and releasing the bugs that intensify toward closure. Interiority is concrete in moments like feeling the "gritty silk of change," but emotions lean toward abstract summary rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final realization earns a meaningful endurance with felt cost of his destitution, though flaws feel slightly balanced without deep moral ambiguity. Voice distinction is strong in single-POV, with micro-choices revealing values like sharing his meal.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist Elara's calm inventiveness is consistently shown through her actions, like aligning the quill holder, revealing internal traits that drive the intrigue without stock phrasing. However, the group of allies feels underdeveloped, with secondary characters applying minimal pressure and no distinct status dynamics, diluting relational crucibles. Emotions are embodied in her steady heart and vigilant duty, but internal contradictions are subtle and don't strongly layer under stress. The final renunciation of overt rebellion earns stasis with conceptual cost, but flaws like generic ally arrivals limit depth.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to unravel sacred patterns is clear and intensifies through her ritual, compelling her final step into the aurora with felt cost of her torment; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like tears blurring the dawn, showing contradictory impulses of doubt and joy acting simultaneously. Strengths include micro-choices under pressure, such as placing rocks despite visions of ruin, revealing her hierarchy of values. No secondary characters, so relationship bullets ignored; single-POV interior contradiction elevates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to map scars through poetry is clear and intensifies toward action, with embodied emotions in pacing and storm-gazing; internal conflict shows in his furious tranquility, culminating in the earned renunciation of isolation as he descends. However, interiority occasionally slips into stock poetic phrasing, like "heart a calm eye amid the gale," diluting character specificity. The final choice reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, as censorship hones his voice but exiles him.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to transform questions into destinations is clear and intensifies through his decoding and fencing practice, culminating in an earned renunciation of violence with visible cost in averted bloodshed. Interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the mechanical arm's whirring during moments of indecision, revealing contradictory impulses like fierce resolve tempered by diplomatic weighing. The final choice feels compelled by prior traits without stock epiphanies, though secondary characters like the rival apply pressure only briefly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Characters like Elias show clear motivation rooted in his vagrant past and monthly molting, with interior contradictions emerging through his shifting personalities that compel choices like revealing the coffee tin; however, Marcus feels secondary and stereotypical as the scarred inmate, with relationships applying pressure but lacking deeper status dynamics in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies through his strategic creativity, compelling him to repurpose the clock and film into a symphony that forecloses regret with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete, with embodied longing in aching fingers and the clock's erratic tick, revealing contradictory impulses in his wistful yet steely resolve. The final performance earns a meaningful change, turning stasis into defiant song, though the single-POV limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation to protect cultural memory is clear and intensifies through dream interpretation, compelling the ritual choice with felt doubt as cost; interiority is concrete via embodied petal brushes and pulsing seed, revealing contradictory impulses in her persistent uncertainty amid resolve. However, emotions lean toward abstract luminosity rather than raw, conflicting embodiment under stress, slightly softening peak authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief-driven traits, intensifying through micro-choices like mixing seawater to reveal the color, culminating in an earned renunciation of unspoken regrets with felt emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in his wry thoughts and deliberate actions under pressure. The single-POV focus excels without needing relationship dynamics, though the backstory reflection anchors effectively without exceeding BRR limits.


== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s shift from spectacle-seeker to humility is credibly embodied in her handling of the butterflies and the notebook; the interior contradiction between old hunger for drama and new patience is dramatized in the moment she overlays dust mandala on neutron-star field. Still, the epiphany leans on a single summative line (“realization dawned”) rather than a final micro-choice that costs her something tangible right then; the release of butterflies reads more symbolic than consequential, capping the arc just short of 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s shift from artist to fugitive is embodied in trembling hands and frost-reading micro-choices; the ledger strip functions as a charged object that tilts her stance. Interiority stays concrete, though a few “steady as glass” similes edge toward label. The final resolve to turn evidence into art earns its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the tuning fork while fearing the silence—are embodied in micro-choices (striking the fork, scanning his own heat-map) that visibly cost him sweat and tremor. The final duet with Lira crystallizes an earned stasis: he accepts perpetual silence as the price for communal resonance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are shown through gesture and thermal flare.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s exhausted undertaker is vivid through aching bones, salt-memory interiority, and the micro-choice to slice his palm on lens-glass; stubborn trait drives every beat. The interior contradiction—craving stillness yet unable to ignore the shard’s cry—stays embodied, not label-speak. Final renunciation of personal rest to anchor others costs him bodily presence in impossible space; cost is legible. Voice remains singular, no status dynamics needed.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s “intergenerational support” drive is dramatized through the relay of food runs; the bell-handoff micro-choice shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“her heart swelling with the motivation that had sustained her”) without label-speak. Status shift is subtle but legible when the youth corrects Elara’s caution, proving elders→youth transfer. Earned stasis lands: she accepts the risk in real time, not afterthought.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “pilgrim of sparks” identity is dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, unpacking the obscura, offering the tear). The brother’s pain and their shared past-life bond create immediate relational pressure that alters both characters’ states by the end. One minor slip: the phrase “spiritually curious nature” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the moment’s rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his calloused hands itch to impose order while his mind quivers in reverie—but the retrocognitive trap is more concept than embodied struggle; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “quiet poise” and “hidden ember” of resolve—but the chains function more as symbol than constraint; no moment shows them physically limiting a choice. The final break against concrete is earned, yet the prior beats feel choreographed rather than wrestled with. Secondary enforcers are generic silhouettes, so status dynamics are absent. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with minor under-embodiment of the central handicap.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s synesthetic trauma, tactile forge-work, and final micro-choice (“slipped the hearing aid into place”) embody a credible internal arc. Motive (“find the sound of trust breaking”) is specific and drives every beat; the healing-body ticking clock adds bodily stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“heard violet as a fragile trill”) rather than diagnostic. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, and the renunciation lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire to “steal illuminated moments” is vivid, but her interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“destiny’s door”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final shift from thief to guardian is signaled more than dramatized, though the moonlit transformation carries felt awe.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is legible and emotionally anchored; the thawing-heart concept externalizes grief and the decision to leave the ruin shows credible growth. Yet every beat is narrated in oratorial summary, so we never watch Elias’s hands hesitate, tremble, or choose—the interior contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. The final beat (“builder steps from his forge”) lands, but the cost is declared (“abandoning the cradle”) rather than embodied in a micro-choice we can taste. Still, the arc coheres and the renunciation is earned; only the absence of on-page gesture undercuts full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s phobias are dramatized through embodied action (tight shelves, balcony rail) and her interior contradiction fuels the final stand; however, the leap from “abandoned orphan” to full dossier of forged memories happens in one lump of exposition, blunting the arc’s credibility and capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsession is embodied in tactile pacing and the flaking booklet; her contradictory impulses—yearning to map the void yet renouncing paper—are dramatized in the final silence. The cost is the star’s extinction, a felt forfeiture that crystallizes her stance. No stock phrasing; interiority is character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid, but the prose tells us “compulsion” rather than letting robotic stillness collide with the ache of wonder; the bow-touch moment embodies her, yet the interior loop-labels (“thoughts emerged from such unions”) keep emotion abstract and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guarded interiority is textured through concrete micro-choices—pocketing the lens, trembling as he draws—so the thaw feels earned. The doodle of the unlocking chest crystallizes his contradictory impulses on the page. Still, the two strangers remain sketches; their sudden trust is more symbol than crucible, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s pragmatic skepticism toward the Luckometer is embodied in every gesture; the cracked marbles serve as tactile memory of past deceptions, and his final smile—earned by the vine’s return of a lost talisman—shows a credible, wordless renunciation of quantified luck. Interiority stays rooted in sensory detail (worn thumb-pads, resin scent) rather than abstract labels. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory framing (“proving eternally that…”) just before closure, which slightly dilutes the earned hush.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is sketched through concrete lab gestures and the way she notices “yesterday’s” wingbeat nudging “tomorrow,” giving us an interior contradiction alive in scene. Jax’s obliging warmth is embodied in the modulated timbre of his dialogue and the grease on his gloves—actions that align with motive. The final shared breath in the dome amounts to a credible micro-choice: they lock the lever knowing the nexus could destabilize, trading safety for proof—cost is felt. Status stays static (she leads, he assists), so relationship crucible is thin; that caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with Isabella’s code is vivid and embodied—his trembling fingers, the bow tracing symbols—but the interior contradiction between curiosity and dread is only gestured at, not dramatized in a single decisive micro-choice. The final renunciation (accepting the half-known truth) is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (stay vs. descend) coexist in the same beats. The fever-recovery frame gives her a credible, character-specific vulnerability that sharpens the final choice. Mira’s peripheral presence supplies relational pressure without crowding the single POV. The earned renunciation—carrying the smudged illustration downhill—pays the visible cost of leaving the only refuge she knows.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s reckless streak is shown through tunnel entry and radio-code “appraisal,” but the brother-abandonment guilt arrives as a late lumped confession rather than an embodied, scene-tainted undercurrent; the micro-choice of pocketing the valve is strong, yet the final surrender to memory feels narrated rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the arc tilts informed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s “witness without judgment” motive is concrete and drives every beat; his trembling hands and loosening grip on reality embody contradiction under pressure. Yet his interiority recycles phrasing (“loosely gripped,” “regenerative silence”) without fresh micro-choices once the swan is found—observation stays static, so the final endurance costs him little we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is embodied and specific; the curl in her palm and her “cautious exuberance” reveal layered grief and hope. Theo’s guarded twitch and tearful wonder are credibly childlike. Their bond shifts from wary parallel to shared breath under eclipse pressure, earning the final hand-off of the curl as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elowen’s odd historian persona is rich in concrete interiority ("pressed her ear to cracked plaster"), interior contradiction, and embodied emotion, but she remains largely reactive rather than driving decisive turns; her endurance that forecloses a path appears only at the thematic level, not in on-page micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet yearning to “transpose his life into a new key” is embodied in the tactile ritual of etching microdots; the moment he freezes when Maris repeats his unreleased fortune crystallizes his interior contradiction between control and fate. His flaws—hubris and isolation—drive the choice to seed the island’s future, and the cost is legible in the chill of recognition that he may be the tool, not the architect.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his embodied dread and resolve anchor the piece—but the “hidden assumptions” motive is asserted more than dramatized; we see the rhetorical attack, not the moment he confronts his own complicity. Still, the single POV holds, and the final renunciation (releasing the pedal) carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—aching to retrieve lost time while racing against exhaustion—is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing the shell, whispering fortunes). The final “attunement” is earned because each spiral he maps costs dwindling wakefulness, visible in trembling fingers and eyelids. Voice never slips into diagnostic cliché; “chronologically homesick” stays a lived ache, not a label. Could edge higher if a single memory beat forced him to revise self-concept rather than merely unearth nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her levitation feels like a lived power, not a label—but her “labyrinth of self” stays abstract; no concrete contradiction is dramatized inside the maze, so the final fusion feels foregone rather than wrested. The tablet is handled, yet its runes never resist or surprise her; she never misreads, drops, or doubts it, so the object reveals nothing new about her. Motivation is declared early and reiterated, but no micro-choice inside the labyrinth is sharpened by a visible cost; the shadow-self is dispatched in one line with no lasting sting. Earned stasis is asserted (“self whole at last”) yet the price paid remains invisible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile search for “a filament of hush” embodies the contradiction of a deaf musician craving silence to feel. The micro-choice to rig the broken needle and press her palms to the phonograph is a charged, embodied risk that crystallizes her arc. Emotional thaw is earned through these physical acts, not declared. Only the sister’s death remains slightly abstract, blunting the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s wistful caution is embodied in every beat—gloved hand, trembling uncorking, kneeling surrender—so the interior contradiction stays physical. The surge of memory that drowns him is credibly foreshadowed by his own prior warnings to clients, so the final collapse feels earned. The only gap is that Elara’s death is delivered in a single retrospective clause; because that trauma is the pivot of his surrender, the beat needs one on-page sensory flash of the fatal moment to lock causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—wandering freedom vs binding fate—are embodied in micro-choices: tracing grotto spirals, coiling rope, letting it fall. Interiority is specific and charged, but the poet’s stance crystallizes more than it decisively changes; the rope as talisman rather than active tool caps the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his acoustic perception is embodied in every gesture, and his contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—turning the bowl right-side up and letting others speak—earns its cost through prior causality and visibly forecloses his solo narrative. Secondary characters are sketched with just enough specificity to apply pressure without clutter. One minor slip: the boy’s “trees that dreamed of rain” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear interior contradiction—detached dealer who secretly longs to feel—drives every beat; the embodied static-tingle mechanic makes emotion legible without label-speak. Final collapse into widower’s grief is earned because the causal chain (scent → chemistry → memory → empathy) is staged early and paid off with tactile cost (petal turns to dust in palm). Thoroughness trait shows up as on-page cataloguing and constrains her speed of surrender, sharpening the stakes. Only keeps her out of 9-band because no second character on page means relationship crucible and status shifts remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s shrewd/caring duality is embodied in micro-choices—scanning donors, kneeling for the locket, offering cargo routes—yet interiority occasionally drifts into explanatory summary (“he knew compassion’s true power…”) rather than felt contradiction. Mira’s quiet competence is sketched through action, but her emotional cost is inferred more than dramatized. The final partnership lands as earned, with visible social capital risk.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her longing bruised by the orchard’s exclusion is embodied in the hum of the fruit-lanterns—and her final sculptural act crystallizes her integration (cost: solitude). Small scout: her “bold sympathy” label is flat in the last paragraph. Character arcs cleanly without slips.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s profession motivates every micro-choice: sketching guides her decisions, borrowed time pressures her tactics, and her illustrator’s eye charges the final echo. Flaws (curiosity, hubris) visibly compound in choices. Earned endurance at climax forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elowen’s grief and scholarly drive stay coherent; her tactile tracing of bark and stone embodies the ache. Still, the text labels the loss “ambiguous” so often that interiority tilts toward thesis rather than lived contradiction, muting the felt cost at the crucial beat where she pockets the eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tape fragment triggers a concrete childhood memory that re-weights his present goal. His shift from hidden caretaker to visible helper is earned by the father-memory and crystallized in the final note. Only minor: the young woman’s interiority is sketched rather than lived, slightly diluting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s scientific drive and loneliness are vivid; the decision to surrender to the leaf is foreshadowed by her studied hunger to “witness from within.” Yet the interior contradiction—yearning for fusion while fearing loss of human form—is asserted more than dramatized in scene; the bodily shift is recounted rather than chosen under micro-pressure. Still, her embodied sensations (“veins tingled, green threads weaving”) give credible cost, earning a solid mid-7 slot.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s insomnia and painter-identity are shown through action—night daubing, cracked-clay doorstep, brush in hand at the end—but interiority drifts into stock phrases (“phantom rains to combat the dryness of his soul”). The amber trade registers as a credible micro-choice that costs him an heirloom and buys sleep; still, Mira functions more as thematic mirror than crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s ambition to “magnify everyday magic” is concrete and idiosyncratic; her embodied panic as shadows coil (“cool and insistent”) sells the stakes. Interiority slips into dramatic self-diagnosis (“realized the unseen forces’ true nature”) at the very beat when contradiction should explode; a hairline disconnect between sensation and summary keeps her from an 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive to “compile fragments into meaning” is stated repeatedly yet never sharpened into a concrete risk or dilemma; interiority stays lyric-surf rather than contradictory under pressure. No micro-choice visibly forfeits an alternative path, so the final hum feels symbolic, not personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “analytically artistic” mind is shown through concrete choices—tracing cracks, decoding arrows, folding her sigil—yet interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical summary (“trembling certainty coil”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final boarding is earned, but the cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s skeptic-concerned heart is concrete; interiority shows simultaneous contradictory pulls, and her micro-choice to assist Lir re-channels the scene. There’s credible interior change, though the change is more emotional stance than full arc.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s boredom-to-curiosity pivot is embodied (“heart… quickened”) and anchored in concrete micro-choices (lifting the shard, weaving magnetic lines). The contradiction between immortal ennui and sudden hunger for the “after” is dramatized, not declared, and the final smile carries visible cost: the shard’s spent heat in her palm forecloses immediate re-use. Interiority stays specific to her dimensional sight; no stock therapy labels intrude. The only slack is the late, single-sentence plan to “plot the next storm”—a tell that slightly blunts the earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, the shiver from the ink—but the “mathematics of fair trade” remains abstract until the final letter; the shift from contempt to reluctant acceptance is earned, though the cost feels more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s obsession with “textures of different times” is vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him choose between conflicting values. The decision to descend is announced, not tested, so the cost feels assumed, not earned. Embodied emotion is strong early (gold-stained hands, lamp-hum matching pulse) but thins once the labyrinth becomes backdrop. Still, the sensory-specific vocation and the solitary ritual give him a memorable silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wanderer’s erased-identity flaw fuels every eavesdropping micro-choice; the accumulating self-portrait through stolen stories is embodied, not labeled. There is no interior contradiction shown in-scene, only a steady accretion, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged. Still, the final “nameless existence that filtered the labyrinth’s chaos into something whole” is earned by the prior layering beats and carries a visible cost: perpetual displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s skepticism, intellectual pride, and buried ache are shown through embodied reactions to the cello’s retellings; contradictory impulses (debunk vs. listen) coexist in scene. The shell’s warming pulsing against his palm externalizes the interior shift without label-speak. Micro-choice—eyes closing, accepting the hum—pays the cost of foreclosed certainty, earning credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “dual allegiance” is embodied in the moment she palms the stone chip and later when she absorbs the juggler’s turmoil. Micro-choices (daubing graffiti, scaling a lantern post) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final vote crystallizes her arc with visible cost: carnival soul preserved, but corporate order admitted. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s curiosity is concrete—she pockets the grain, rigs the chem-lab, keeps the vigil—every beat springs from that trait. Interiority stays sensory (“heart ached with dawnlit melancholy”), never diagnostic. The final endurance costs her body and future access to the summit, so renunciation is earned. Only minor flaw: the “precious” refrain flirts with label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingertips “reading” fractures in light and alloy—but the apprentices remain sketches; their dialogue is deferential wallpaper. The earned cost is present: the drone’s flight is his renunciation of control, yet the apprentices add no crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s cartographic obsession is concrete and embodied; the condensation epiphany shows thought in motion. Interior contradiction surfaces once—quiet mastery vs. latent dread—yet the renunciation at the end (“pressed on”) carries only muted cost, blunting the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elowen’s drive is clear and her patience is dramatized through stillness and micro-gestures, but she never makes a costly choice; the entire beat sequence is observation and gentle guidance. No contradiction or visible flaw complicates her stance, so the “earned” quality stays theoretical. Interiority is atmospheric rather than specific, and the single on-page farmer, Thorne, is a cardboard herald, not pressure. Closure is collective, not personal, so her arc remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her memories surface through sensory triggers rather than exposition. The contradiction between panic and deliberate calm is dramatized in the kelp sequence. Final choice to reseal the vial and pulse the beacon is earned by prior micro-choices. Minor slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “harness the ephemeral” could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his pulse aligning with the grooves of the door scuffs crystallizes the inherited burden. The final renunciation (“I am not my father’s echo”) is earned by the tactile confrontation with the lattice and the ghost-map. Flaws (the compulsion to overwrite legacy) actively complicate his choices. Cost is felt in the lighter yet irreversible inheritance he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “callused fingers,” “orchid solace,” and sleepwalking trance all reveal contradictory impulses (hope vs. ruin) in scene. The final act of sewing the paths is credibly motivated by her prior traits and the plate’s talismanic pull, with visible cost: she seals the weave alone at dawn, accepting perpetual stewardship. Minor slip: the shift from solitary weaver to communal guide is asserted more than dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Warmly-curious curiosity fuels every beat; embodied emotion in “hands callused from sifting soil” grounds interiority.  No contradictory impulses shown in-scene, and final restoration is only summarized, not dramatized with visible cost, keeping her change declarative rather than earned-under-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s margin-seeking impulse is concrete and embodied in the chalk ritual, but the stakes never press back; no contradictory impulse or visible cost complicates his inventiveness, so the arc flattens into mere performance rather than tested character. The final “Shadow Weaver” tag feels gifted, not earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet obsession to “listen for unheard stories” is embodied in her needlework and feigned clumsiness, but the interior contradiction—wisdom masked as foolishness—never quite collides with itself on the page; we see the mask, not the moment it slips and costs her. The final beat folds the chart and chooses stealth, a credible renunciation, yet the emotional price feels inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cryptic surface vs. aching need to speak—are dramatized in every beat; the shard-warmed hand and tear-mist fusion embody the fierce tenderness. The final renunciation of silence is causally earned by the prior visions and the condensation-messages she literally writes with spirit-compelled fingers. Cost is visible: the mended shard and evaporated words show the path foreclosed. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation to “graft new meaning onto old wounds” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a forked choice; her decrypting is steady, not pressured. The lotus-hearted ache is named, not embodied in a contradictory micro-action. Interiority drifts into lofty paraphrase (“tender sorrow for fragile lives”) rather than moment-specific tension. She never risks anything we can see—no withheld word, no mis-translation—so the ache stays decorative, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s desire to “rediscover lost joy” is stated early and re-activated by the orchard fragment, but his interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“pensive mirth bubbling up”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choice is present—kneeling, tracing, painting with light—yet none carry a tangible cost or risk; the emotional lift feels gifted by daydream logic rather than earned. The ending grin is credible, but the stakes never tighten enough to make the recovery feel wrested from him. Still, the vocation-specific sensory lens keeps him individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s “methodically playful” trait is shown—not told—via tactile coin manipulations and echo-weaving that visibly costs her poise. Elias’s transformation from fact-hoarder to wondering wanderer is legible in his dropped notebook and trailing fingers; the hobo nickel’s returning warmth marks the price she quietly pays to seed that change. Interiority stays concrete (“whistled softly,” “fingers tracing,” “nickel warmed”) and avoids label-speak. Relationship shift is present but compressed; a micro-choice on her part that risked exposing her private practice would have nudged this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s rogue charm and defiant spark are vivid, but interior contradiction is thin; the warp ritual is the only moment where desire and risk visibly collide. His charm is more posture than embodied flaw, so the final “guard” stance feels earned yet not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s insomnia and poetic drive are vivid, but her agency is largely lyrical—she “sings,” “whispers,” “sinks,” rather than choosing under pressure. The decisive shift from isolation to blossom-armistice is asserted more than dramatized; we watch imagery bloom, but the interior cost is summarized (“centuries of longing lifting”) rather than felt in a micro-choice. The postcard functions as muse, yet never tests or complicates her motive on-page. Interior contradiction is sketched, not enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s quiet, ritualized caretaking is embodied and specific; her “gentle defiance against oblivion” is dramatized in the act of mending the chime. The foxglove regret is felt, not labeled, and the final endurance—folding the cloth over the restored chime—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but muted; the piece leans on lyric accumulation rather than sharp internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "carefully reckless" paradox is dramatized in every beat—inkwell lifted, glyph risked, vow spoken—so Elara’s hierarchy of values is legible under pressure; Thorne’s wary thaw is embodied rather than told. Interior contradiction is sustained: exuberant hunger collides with real fear of betrayal, and both impulses stay active as she writes. The final restored partnership is earned because the inked promises sequentially expose and pay for her past secrecy; the cost (potential for metaphysical backfire) is on the page. Dialogue stays minimal, so no voice convergence penalty; what little Thorne says reads distinctively cautious.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his calloused hands, the tremor in his grasp—but the “conflicting values” remain abstract until the envelope’s cipher gives them concrete form. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the chain’s redefinition from conquest to unity. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his ritual of mapping dust motes to steady memory loss is specific and charged. The shift from forged histories to authentic song-sharing with Mira is earned through visible micro-choices and cost. Secondary pressure from Mira is minimal but sufficient to tilt trust. The final renunciation of reinvention carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s longing is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyric shorthand (“motivation burned softly”) that tells more than shows; the father’s voice flashback supplies motive yet arrives too late to shape her micro-choices under pressure. No embodied contradiction plays out in real time—she never hesitates, backtracks, or pays an on-page price for mis-reading the wood or the codes—so the final crossing feels gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s yearning for “the rhythm of belonging” is vivid and embodied in her coral-alignment test, but the interior contradiction—why a land-based astrologer doubles as deep-sea diver—goes unexamined. The feather moment forces a micro-choice (scan, not pocket) that reveals gentle ingenuity, yet her ensuing trance is asserted, not dramatized. Closure earns a poised resonance but the cost is abstract; we feel shift more than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s longing is palpable and embodied in her handling of the crater glass; the internal contradiction between cheerful resignation and active curiosity is shown through micro-gestures rather than told. Yet her final epiphany—“paths disappear because we conjecture without committing”—is articulated in clean therapist language that the text has not dramatized as her idiom; the insight feels imported rather than earned from her sea-foam diction. The bird encounter supplies outside pressure, but the emotional cost of her choice (planting the remaining seeds) is asserted, not tasted; we see tears but no irreversible forfeiture. Voice specificity is strong in early lyrical lines, falters in the closing moral phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “analytical” tag is repeated but never shows simultaneous contradictory impulses; his choices are smooth, low-risk orchestrations rather than pressured micro-decisions. The bishop piece operates more as prop than crucible—no moment where its loss or misuse threatens him—so the final pocketing feels administrative, not costly. Because no relationship or status crucible is on-page, the single-POV default is met, yet interiority stays safely ornamental (“analytical mind,” “satisfaction deepening”) without embodied irrationality under visible strain.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s desire to tattoo a cosmic verse is vivid, but her interior contradictions stay static; the “obsidian grace” refrain performs stoicism rather than showing fracture under pain. Spontaneous anchoring is declared, never tested against a counter-urge, so the final lift feels pre-sanctioned, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s yearning is palpable, but his interior monologue drifts into lyrical abstraction (“noctilucent reckonings”) that tells us the insight rather than dramatizing it. The single decisive act—adjusting a loose panel—feels light against the grand rhetoric; we need one earlier beat where glasswork visibly fails or costs him something so the final touch lands as earned sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—tender precision against burned stoicism—surfaces early and lingers, but the arrival of Lena forces no new choice; his monologue simply externalizes what reflection has already delivered. The porcelain box functions as an evocative proxy yet never tests or alters his stance; the final “enlightening” is summary, not a micro-choice with cost. Because no live option is foreclosed, the arc lands as illustration rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of the gauge and shells reveals a mind under pressure—but the “logical dreamer” label is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to release the balloon earns its cost, yet the contradiction between cold calculus and raw grief could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, the weight of legacy—but the shift from passive discovery to active atonement is compressed; the “map to follow” feels slightly asserted rather than earned in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to keep her twin alive while knowing the heartbeat is borrowed—are embodied in her careful song-codes and the tremor in her touch. The final renunciation (accepting the heartbeat’s release) is earned by the escalating mirror visions and costs her last illusion of control.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—peace broker who profits from endless war—surfaces only in generic “price” abstractions; no embodied micro-choice leaks her own blood or forfeits a concrete privilege. The clipboard-ceremony moment is graceful, but her renunciation is reported, not dramatized, so the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, her “operatively gentle” tactic shapes the final beat, earning a solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—empire-builder vs. bird-haunted boy—coexist in every beat; the egg warms in his gloved hand while he calculates exposure, and the final crack is earned by that dual track. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The cost is legible: he walks away with his alibi intact but his self-justification dissolved, a visible price scaled to the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s chastity and quiet rebellion are consistent, but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“her heart quickened, but her face remained serene”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her micro-choices (thread-pulling) align with motive yet the embodied cost is muffled by ornate filigree. She earns a renunciation, but the price feels aesthetic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s urbane calligrapher identity is vivid in the puppet-show flashback, but the pivot to “ethical storytelling” is declared more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels precipitated by abstract reflection rather than a concrete, embodied cost. His serenity is stated repeatedly but never fractures under observable pressure, so the internal contradiction remains theoretical. The story stick functions as a talisman yet never forces a micro-choice that hurts; thus the change is mild, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing walls, breath syncing with butterflies—but the “esoteric realist” label is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a sharper contradiction in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s grief, guilt and craft-based ingenuity are vivid; the embodied “snowmelt ardor” gives her a credible pulse. Yet her change from self-forgiveness to preservationist mission is declared rather than dramatized in-scene, so the decisive inner shift feels slightly convenient. No contradictory impulses play out live; the rope-braiding sequence shows dexterity but not wrenching choice. Still, the vocational specificity and tactile memory work keep her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s delayed-foresight gift and the enigma of “chosen paths” anchor every major choice; her final ascension into the storm ties motive to closure with visible existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s frugality and star-fixed devotion stay consistent; the tile discovery and schematic mapping feel motive-driven. Interiority is dense, sometimes drifting into abstract lyric rather than embodied moment, muting contradictory impulse. Covenant whisper is earned, but change is more cosmic confirmation than personal cost—still, the stance crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming is embodied in tactile micro-choices—offering the box, brushing Thorne’s hand—each action calibrated to awaken cellular memory. Her contradictory impulses (non-violent yet manipulative) coexist in-scene, and the final renunciation of force carries visible cost as she pockets the box again. Thorne’s shift from clenched fists to silent tears is earned by the memory transfer, not authorial fiat. Minor slip: “scheming pacifist” is once label-speak, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—pragmatic craftsman vs. dream-chaser—is embodied in every micro-choice (breath-sync, shard placement). The “runaway dream” is never labeled but enacted; his groundedness anchors the vision without therapy-speak. Cost is felt when fog thins and the orchard’s decay fuses with glass peaks. One slip: the dream’s origin is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the inciting wound.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s stubborn craft and embodied memory anchor the piece; his micro-choice to thread Mira’s ribbon into the quartz eye crystallizes generational stakes. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with contradiction—he grumbles yet persists. The final renunciation (refusing to descend until the eye gleams) carries visible cost. Only the off-stage Mira weakens relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid, but “bewildered” never complicates her choices; she passively receives visions instead of making a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The final resolve (“catalog no more”) is declared, not dramatized, so the turn feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” label is dramatized in the frond-pluck/ash-reveal beat, but interiority drifts into lofty editorial summary (“her motivation burned fierce”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so closure feels efficient, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s twin-quest motive is vivid and embodied (swatch pressed to thigh, voice weaving). Contradictory impulses—bliss in abnormality vs. dread of erasure—co-exist, but the beat where she “smiled” at the end feels unearned: no micro-choice shows her accepting the cage, so the cost is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “adaptable” and “methodical” traits stay visible—she fingers the rope, whispers incantations, re-braids—but interior contradiction is never activated under pressure; the wax seal decision feels pre-planned rather than wrestled-with, so the closure lacks felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her steady motivation to “find the quiet in the storm” is dramatized through tactile ritual and micro-choices. The echo chamber stone and ice-crack reading are not props but extensions of her lineage and psyche, revealing contradictory impulses (guardianship vs. surrender) under pressure. The final renunciation—allowing the bloom of hush to subsume the beings’ storm—carries visible cost: her maps are forever silenced. Flaws (solitary vigil, inherited burden) drive the mistake-compounding that earns the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calloused hands on frost-etched rails, the shard’s silence sharpening focus—but the “retrocognitively blessed” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we see visions, not the cost of using them. The final choice to rekindle the beacon is earned by her accumulated micro-choices, yet the emotional contradiction between doubt and faith could be more embodied in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, preemptive nostalgia, embodied dread—yet her decisive choice to reweave memory is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt but not fully earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the chant, the “serious playfulness”—but the story never lets us feel the contradiction between hope and despair inside one beat; the shift from defeat to resolve is narrated rather than embodied. The final smile lands as earned because the ritual of filtering the rag and igniting the word “Rise” externalizes the cost, yet we don’t witness a moment where he almost turns back. Secondary characters are absent, so the crucible is internal; that works, but the absence of a live counter-pressure keeps the arc from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her micro-choice to place the cicada at the pool’s edge crystallizes her stance and reweights Thorne’s future. The moment of empathy—watching the jade warm under starlight—grounds her motivation without therapy-speak. One slip: “her heart swelled with quiet empathy” edges toward summary rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s fear of enclosure and hunger for silence are vivid; her micro-choice to dart along the trellis to “sip” the gilded hush embodies the trait. The porcelain doll as externalized sensor is clever, yet her interior register drifts into abstract “flavor” cataloguing that feels analytic rather than visceral at the peak beat. Father’s single interrogation supplies useful contrast but no tangible status shift, so relationship pressure stays thin. Earned stasis is credible: she preserves the hush and refuses the bunker, cost felt in the tightening gravity, but the emotional price is stated more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet caretaker persona is consistent, but his interiority stays largely abstract; the single moment of embodied change—Lira’s shoulders easing—lands, yet his own emotional cost remains off-stage, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s longing for organic past is vivid, but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction; final ascent feels inevitable rather than wrested from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, the ring’s weight as anchor—yet the “tender shadow keeper” label is repeated rather than dramatized, and the companion’s interior state is ventriloquized without on-page contradiction. The final choice to release the ring is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s survivor-cunning and “virtuously mischievous” streak are shown through her decision to play along with the quantum messages rather than reject them; the embodied moment of tightening the bolt crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, but the text drifts into label-speak (“quantum promise,” “communal wealth”) that blurs contradiction under peak pressure. Motivation tightens to the beat, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral, capping short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied—his racing thoughts grounded by the cool crank handle—but the final epiphany is delivered via diary rather than dramatized choice, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elowen's shift from isolation to active orchestration is embodied and earned; the unsnapping of armor crystallizes his renunciation of solitude. Interiority is specific—"shivering bliss" and "murmured allegiance" reveal contradictory impulses without label-speak. The cost of re-engagement is visible in the final image: armor open, vulnerability embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliza’s grief-rooted drive to “magnify small kindnesses” is embodied in her tactile handling of the ledger and the final resolve to transcribe Josiah’s story; the interior contradiction between retreat and engagement is dramatized rather than labeled. Yet the moment of change—her heart “stirred” by the button—leans on summary rather than a fresh micro-choice, blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” tag is dramatized—key into driftwood lock, puddle-map read under drone threat—yet interiority drifts into thesis language (“tyranny of indifference”) that short-circuits embodied contradiction. Kael’s reappearance supplies relational pressure, but his erased-then-returned arc is told, not resource-constrained; the key’s loss registers only as symbolic drop, not micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory need to both honor and silence his grandmother’s prophecy is embodied in the hush he crafts; the saxophone becomes an extension of his silence, and the final renunciation—letting the prophecy dissolve into negative space—carries visible cost in the grotto’s hush. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the micro-choice to withhold sound rather than produce it reconfigures his stance. No secondary characters appear, so relationship bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s compulsive order and covert longing create credible tension; the leaf-reading obsession drives every beat, yet her inner shift from cataloguer to myth-weaver feels earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “itch to befriend uncertainty” is embodied in tactile choices like wedging the compass into rock. The contradiction between craving chance and clinging to precision is dramatized, not stated. Yet the late appearance of the compass limits how deeply it can re-weight his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The interior contradiction—steady-handed alchemist whose fingers now tremble—grounds Elarion; every micro-choice (grinding aurum with gutter-rain, inscribing her name into the crack) is traceable to his guilt and need to balance cosmic ledgers. Embodied emotion is vivid: steam mingling with tears, the crucible’s new weight “shared.” No safety-hedging: he admits negligence and accepts the scarred vessel as permanent penance. The only bar to 9+ is that Lirra remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is one-sided; still, her absent presence drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s modest fearlessness steadies every choice; her interiority juxtaposes sorrow and quiet resolve, embodied in tactile micro-decisions like threading the crocodile’s tooth. Internal conflict—between drawing confessions and guarding her own grief—drives each beat and earns the bittersweet closing embrace with Thorne. Credibly flawed, never self-diagnosing, she forecloses her own comfort to gift spectral laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-forgiveness vs. self-punishment—are embodied in the strap’s bite and the tree’s texture; the final vow to “walk until the mathematics revealed itself” crystallizes a cost-laden stance. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One minor slip: “displaced rootedness” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the lens fragment as talisman anchors her choices. The father’s absence is felt as pressure, not exposition. One beat—her whispered translation—earns the closure cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s motive—“what ceilings hide”—is concrete and distinctive, but we never feel it collide with a counter-desire or fear; the ghosts register only as pity-objects, not as complicating mirrors of his own hunger for secrets. His single decisive act (pocketing the barrel) is motivated by generic compassion rather than a prior, visible internal conflict, so the cost feels light. Competence and observational gift are shown, yet neither trips him up nor exacts price; the flaw line is thin. Interiority stays sensory, not diagnostic, but the emotional hierarchy never sharpens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s longing to compress eternity is stated early and drives the final act, yet interiority remains abstract—no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure until the uncorking. The bottled whisper catalyzes a visible cost (library’s collapse, his isolation sealed), but the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized. Still, the arc from obsession to earned stasis is coherent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—defeatist elegist vs. visionary myth-maker—co-exist in the same beats; the shard-etching micro-choice visibly forecloses scholarly purity and costs him his last claim to militant truth, earning a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow,” “polished grief”) and avoids label-speak. The small circle of skeptics functions as status mirror: their shift from weary dismissal to tentative hope externalizes the stakes. Motive progression is steady: grief → shard-as-tool → invented myth → revolutionary rebirth, each step causally tethered.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and embodied—his love for the world’s melody drives every micro-choice. The interior contradiction (doubt vs. hope) is dramatized through the chip’s wilting, not told. A credible renunciation of certainty earns the dawn, though secondary characters are absent, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s eccentricity and yearning feel lived-in, and her compass-born visions push her into decisive latent action. Interior contradiction surfaces when sensuous petrichor clashes with sterile limestone, grounding her arc. One clear turning beat (compass reading) earns a modest earned-stasis close.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the compass crystallizes her quest without resolving it, shifting her perception of mystery and cost. Causality holds as each beat narrows her options toward the lagoon. The inferred lens (Causal) is consistent with the final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s driftwood sculptor identity is embodied through tactile carving and storm-battered hands; her “perpetually learning” trait drives the micro-choice to carve the hybrid figure, but interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical summary rather than concrete contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is textured and specific; Elara’s sensory attention to glass, postcards, and snow feels lived-in. Yet the decisive shift—choosing to paint the pavilion wall—rests on a conceptual leap (“flowers bloom at night to claim their own light”) that the story articulates but does not dramatize through a visible, costly choice in the final beat. Motivation sustains across beats but never tightens under a tangible trade-off or irreversible act; the emotional arc completes more as recognition than stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s solemn resolve is embodied in tactile detail—hands sifting silt, lungs burning—yet her contradictory fear of psychic dissolution is only summarized, not dramatized in-scene. The final vow lands as earned renunciation, but interior contradiction could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s refusal of escape and turn to memory-forged planning is credibly rooted in earlier cowardice, giving his interiority a sharp contradiction. The “rejects false comfort” trait shows up in two micro-choices—leaving the bottle untouched and stepping into the mist to stake garden plots—so the endurance carries cost. Emotional embodiment stays specific (salt-crusted windows, pocketed vial) rather than label-speak. Flaw is present but cost feels moderate, not gutting, capping the band just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the drum of his heart—but the “archive emotional patterns” motive is asserted more than dramatized. The childhood theft and lifelong vow create a credible through-line, yet the final beat of pressing the shaving to his chest feels slightly abstract rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—guardian of borrowed time—remains consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract lyricism (“wild serenity,” “velvet rasp”) that blurs embodied stakes. Micro-choices (placing acorn cap, tracing runes) are concrete yet feel pre-ordained, not wrestled with. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure; the arc is too smooth. Cost is gestured at, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet listening credo is embodied in every micro-choice—fixing the rope, hesitating at the switch, pulling the bell instead—earning the Earned Stasis of renouncing the siren. Interiority is concrete (“glue dried true”) and cost is felt. Passes the 9+ test via visible renunciation with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “spiritually curious soul” is embodied in tactile acts like cradling the lantern glass—but the shift from cosmic janitor to cosmic guardian is asserted more than dramatized; the cost of his new stance is implied rather than felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is quietly specific—“mute eloquence,” tracing seams—yet his contradictory impulses (preserve silence vs. intervene) are told, not dramatized in scene. The final gesture earns an Earned Stasis, but the cost is implied rather than embodied; we see glass realign, not what Elias forfeits. Still, the perceptual signature holds: his astonishment stays credibly restrained, never tipping into self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s visceral need to feel time’s texture is embodied in every beat—his trembling hands, fevered assembly, final step into “forever.” The orphan wound and Mira’s loss charge each micro-choice with felt cost. Interior contradiction surfaces when he both clings to and releases borrowed time. The arc earns its renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and poet-specific; her micro-choice to cradle the scarred conch embodies the “beauty in the incomplete” motive. The internal contradiction—clinging vs. releasing—peaks when the string snaps; cost is felt in the emptied hand. Yet the kite’s flight is observed, not chosen, so agency is observational rather than active, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quietly defiant calm anchors every choice; the diary-as-confidant and copper spirals externalize his gentle systematic nature and welded stubborn hope. Interiority stays concrete (“callused yet gently systematic,” “breath caught… awe”) without lapsing into label-speak. The final, bodily sense that orchard energy loosens the cancer’s grip feels earned because his prior tactile labor (root-mapping, wire-humming) dramatized the same communion. Missing secondary pressure keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s skeptical drive is vivid and embodied—her fingers on Galileo’s bust, her boots sinking in mud—but the interior contradiction between rebellion and yearning for homecoming is asserted more than dramatized; the final nod from envoys feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned by her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet, fierce motive (“let a garden reclaim this battlefield”) is the engine of every beat; his ritual scattering of seed-dust dramatizes an internal contradiction between enduring guilt and stubborn hope. Embodied micro-choices—kneeling, cracking pods, murmuring extinct syllables—keep interiority concrete; no therapeutic self-labeling. The ending’s Earned Stasis (he forecloses retreat, accepts the fragile sprouts as sufficient cost) is fully prepared by the satchel’s weight and the hermit-taught tongues. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible untested, capping short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harlan’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. survival—are embodied in the leaf and cylinder; his final acceptance of Elara’s betrayal is earned by prior sensory decoding and costs him the fantasy of reunion. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The wax leaf’s reprise crystallizes his renunciation with visible ache.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara reads vividly—her heightened temporal sensitivity dramatizes interior conflict, each tremor of compass-driven perception embodies both gift and exile—and her earned shift from pariah’s isolation to deliberate explorer anchors the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s “chivalrous thief” code is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him spare a foe or weigh mercy against gain. Interiority leans on abstract labels—“wonder,” “balance,” “entropy’s gloom”—instead of visceral contradiction. The final swap earns poignancy only because the pocket sundial and Lirra’s nod externalize the cost; Elias’s own hierarchy of values stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and historian motive are embodied in beat-level micro-choices (spelling “release” with her feet, erasing chess pieces). Contradictory impulses—benevolent yet ruthless—surface in the deliberate severing of the “unscripted” pawns, earning the late shift inside the whispering gallery. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular without stock metaphors. Closure choice freezes the kings because pawns are already liberated voids: credible Earned Stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen's contradictory impulses—burying sight to escape pain, yet driven to reclaim home—are embodied in mercury-glass flesh and micro-choices (feather on stone). The arc from suppression to architect of memory is earned, culminating in a visible cost: she accepts the thunder of loss as engine rather than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt and need for absolution are palpable and embodied in every chess move and thread he unspools; the interior contradiction between self-loathing and the desire to teach forgiveness is kept alive in scene. Micro-choices—tracing walls with a pawn, whispering absolution to his reflection—carry visible cost and crystallize his hierarchy of values. The single on-page character sustains pressure without drift; no stock phrasing intrudes. Closure beat lands as earned stasis: he forecloses exile by accepting the role of tutor to the thawing village, cost felt in the twitch of a villager’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—giddy mischief against the gravity of permanent judgment—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to launch the first poem in the bone alcove crystallizes motive under pressure. The cost she feels (“her own truth…threatening to overwhelm the spectrum”) is palpable, but because we never see her actually risk discovery by the elders, the stakes feel partially asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the spectrum-building strategy grows logically from her artist-flawed need to avoid erasure, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—doubt vs. the need to forge meaning—are embodied in trembling hands and held breath; the final quilting of regret into resolve is earned by the ritual’s cost and visibly changes him.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his grief, nostalgia, and the private vow anchor every beat. Yet the “intimately aloof” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no on-page moment shows him wrestling with closeness versus distance. The final choice to seal the shell’s truth inside himself is earned, but the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief-tinged resolve is embodied in tactile micro-choices—uncorking, kneeling, recorking—yet the interiority drifts toward abstract “vibrations of intent” rather than contradictory impulse. The mentor’s absence is felt, but Harlan never appears as living pressure, so the relationship crucible is off-stage. Still, the final renunciation (sealing the magic for another day) carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the moon-phase mind-flux and bronze censer anchor contradictory impulses. His midnight calls enact micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values—solace through service—yet the wife remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred, not staged. The earned renunciation (staying to guide others) carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s involuntary truth-telling and goal of psychological safety are clear and thematic, but interiority sometimes resorts to abstract labels instead of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s reclusive habit and memory-borrowing gift are vivid; the final decision to wear the flower shows visible cost. Yet his contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized (“isolation was his creed”) rather than enacted in scene, and the stranger’s off-stage absence prevents relationship pressure. Interiority is atmospheric but drifts toward poetic label-speak (“mocking his solitude”). Still, the micro-choice to pin the Edelweiss to his own coat credibly seals his altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s grief and “empirically intuitive” gift are asserted more than embodied; the interior contradiction between rational map-reader and credulous seeker is declared (“dismissed it then… haunt him”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until he actually kneels to the ants. The final step through the arch lands as an earned renunciation of solitude only because the visions explicitly list what he forfeits; the emotion ischarged but still externally narrated. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the loneliness is atmospheric, not tested in scene beyond the initial statement. Meets the 9+ quick test weakly: causality is present but the cost is told in summary visions, not body.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s disenchantment is concrete—her midnight exit, hem snagging, fingers on cobalt stone. Interiority stays sensory, not diagnostic. The final choice to seal the stars is motivated, yet the contradiction between royal self-loathing and instant spell-crafting isn’t dramatized under pressure; the cost is asserted rather than felt in body or status.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority pulses—her fingers “tracing the curl’s smooth arc” while pocket-suns itch for release—yet Thorne’s cartographer identity never presses a single concrete choice; his confession lands as summary, not crucible. The earned shift is hers alone, costing her a vial and risking the relic, so friendship’s re-valuation feels credible but lopsided.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—Elias’s envy of “feral nostalgia” fuels the writing beat—but no contradiction plays out in-scene; the grave vision is recalled, never re-experienced under pressure, so the final “peace” feels declared rather than earned by micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the screw while fearing its memory—surface in her tactile buffing motion, not in labels. The micro-choice to pocket the polished screw crystallizes her shift from paralysis to tentative renewal, with the weight against her thigh as embodied cost. Silas acts as gentle pressure, not full crucible, so relationship dynamics stay minor. Interiority remains concrete, never drifting into therapy-speak, and the final endurance carries credible, scaled cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the crystals in her veins literalize stress in a character-specific way. The micro-choice to dip the quill in tear-ink anchors reflection to present action. The final renunciation—scars becoming luminous dust—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the elder remains too peripheral to exert relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid—Elara’s metaphor-drunk mind feels singular—but the apology motive is declared, not dramatized until the final speech; no micro-choice shows her fighting the urge to flee or stay. Theo’s translucent-note form is evocative yet passive; he supplies lyrical replies rather than pressure. The reconciliatory hand-brush registers as earned only because the text says “reconnect we have”; prior beats never test her pride against concrete risk. Emotional hierarchy (gossip-columnist identity vs. sister guilt) stays stated, not stressed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The witness’s interiority is vivid—his doubt about whether he truly saw the end is embodied in the dictionary’s pages—but the story withholds any decisive choice that alters tactics; he merely observes and arbitrates. The cost is conceptual rather than personal, so the arc feels slightly external to him.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s solitary obsession is credibly salt-etched into callused ritual, and the backward-count choice is a clean micro-turn that externalizes his need. Yet the interiority drifts into thematic abstraction—“gnawing need,” “razor edges of existence”—that sounds like author commentary rather than a shepherd’s lived language, muting contradiction at the hinge beat. The final smile is too light to register as felt cost; we see realization but no bodily price after the blood drop. Still, within single-POV brevity he does foreclose his former clock-winder identity, satisfying the low-word Earned Stasis bar.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her spatial gift and grief over her brother are shown through action and choice. The final renunciation—letting go of the ghost—lands with felt cost. Minor slip: “physics of letting go” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (rebellion vs responsibility) are dramatized in the lantern-lit moment. The final renunciation—teaching instead of gambling—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: “theoretically rebellious” is label-speak before it is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—nurturing connection only to sever it—remains embodied in every micro-choice; the final renunciation of Clara’s call lands with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One slip: “teach endings how to begin” edges toward thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied, yet her single decisive change—choosing to restore the covenant—leans more on inheritance than earned contradiction; a notch short of the 9+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s reluctant need for connection drives every beat; his interior split between rescuer identity and private ache is embodied in each micro-choice and the final slip-away without thanks. One hairline slip: “gnawed at his nomadic soul” leans label-speak, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mapmaker who must chart the unseeable—lands early and steadies the arc; the platinum ring’s pulses force micro-adjustments that externalise her guilt. Interiority stays concrete (“skin prickled with absorbed phrases”) and avoids label-speak. The final absorption of “forgiveness” risks epiphany shorthand, but the prior trail of loss-memories pays for it. Cost is felt: silence after absorbed screams is permanently replaced by a live melody she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s guilt-driven need to edit the past is vivid; her interiority (“confidently uncertain,” the nib-straightening as self-resolve) is concrete and embodied. Yet the brother remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only asserted via backstory summary, muting the cost she pays now. Still, her micro-choice to twist the pen and accept the anomaly’s lullaby crystallizes a credible hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s hollow longing is embodied early; the camera-as-mirror and his halting sign-language replies show interior contradiction. The final hum costs him social invisibility and charges the camera with new purpose, meeting Earned Stasis. Yet Lir remains an emblem rather than a crucible—his charisma described, not tested—so the relationship side of the rubric stays thin.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s fire-setting motive is vivid, but the off-stage two-year gap keeps us from watching the trait corrode or evolve under live pressure; the “analytically intuitive” label is declared, not stress-tested. Her climactic claim of the codex registers as want, yet the beat is compressed into a single tearful line—cost is asserted, not embodied. Interiority is atmospheric but repeats “volcanic tenderness” until it becomes perfume rather than contradiction. Still, her body-at-work in the archive—calloused fingers decoding weave—gives credible, specific hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses to obey the program and to subvert it play out in embodied drumming and spatial choices. The final renunciation (guarding the dream alone) is earned by prior causal beats and carries visible emotional cost. Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single-POV focus is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet “whispers > shouts” creed is dramatized through the stealth rescue and the final handshake with the coin; Marco’s bull-gait contrast supplies crucible pressure. Interiority stays concrete—heel-strike echolocation, micro-choice to pocket the coin—without label-speak. The only drag: Marco’s panic is seen from outside, so the relationship shift feels reported, not mutually embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief is embodied and specific; the dental mirror as relic anchors her interiority. The guardian’s silence is consistent but remains archetypal—no contradictory impulses or visible cost surface in his stillness. A credible shift occurs when she re-weights the mirror from burden to tool, yet the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his gift of hearing unspoken doubt is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (cradling the king, mapping windows). The contradiction between quiet coach and clandestine strategist is held in scene, not summary. Mira’s brief appearance supplies relational pressure that alters Elias’s stance, though her interiority is filtered through his perception, keeping POV clean.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dock-worker grit vs. mer-blood pull—is dramatized in one continuous motion from crate to dive; the “combative tenderness” toward her own suppressed nature shows in the way she polishes then hugs the scalding scrimshaw. The final shift into scales is earned because the bone has already burned her grip and the whale-song has rattled her sternum—cost is visceral, not declared. Still, the mother-imposed “land-bound normalcy” is asserted once rather than tested in a micro-choice, so the flaw never compounds action. At this length that single-exposition reliance keeps the arc just shy of the 8-band where every beat would reverberate through body and tool alike.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—performer’s reflex versus exhausted numbness—are vividly embodied in the whittling beat; the blank mask is sustained without slipping into diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to narrate the mundane task crystallizes her hierarchy of values: voice as last shield against void. Grief for the sister is anchored in tactile bouquet memory, supplying credible cost. Moral ambiguity remains shield, not evasion, because the text lets it constrain nothing in the present beat—she neither confesses nor atones—so the arc plateaus at renunciation rather than change, capping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s aesthetic drive is repeatedly stated but only once visibly impacts action (wading into thawing ice). Interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The “tremor of certainty” is told, not embodied as a cost-carrying choice, so final stride feels pre-declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s color-blind painter trait is dramatized in his search for “imperfection’s beauty,” but internal conflict stays static—no contradictory impulse is shown mid-beat. The final exchange feels generous rather than costly because Elias never visibly risks or forfeits anything he values. Thorne’s half-dream state is evocative, yet his awakening is supplied by the reed, not by a choice that costs him on-page. Relationship pressure is hinted but never crystallizes into a mutual crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s yearning is palpable and embodied through the carbide lens and bell, but her contradictory impulses stay largely in reflective summary; no micro-choice visibly risks anything until the final ring, so the cost feels muted rather than paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile craft, but her interiority drifts into abstract “curtains of intention” therapy-speak that blurs contradiction. The micro-choice to gift the lotus is present yet feels externally orchestrated rather than wrestled from flaw. Lira’s hollow eyes are sketched, not tested; no status tension complicates the transfer. Overall, a serviceable arc but insufficiently lived-in under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied and specific—her fingers tracing the cards, her voice steady yet vulnerable. The inherited deck and grandmother’s lore anchor her contradictory impulses: to predict and to understand. Theo’s presence forces a micro-choice—she risks sharing the full scope of her quest—which crystallizes her stance. The cost is the exposure of her private method to another, altering their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s longing is vivid, but interiority swerves into abstractions (“anguished joy,” “atoms of nostalgia”) that report rather than embody contradiction. No micro-choice visibly alters tactics once the dance begins; the purification ritual is described, not decided. The child-apparition offers a late external cue instead of an earned internal pivot, so the final acceptance feels given, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile grip on the river stone, the ache of “luminous regret”—but the final choice to stabilize the shadow feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (tears) more than the internal contradiction that forces her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s gentle handler trait is embodied in tactile care; his interior contradiction (trust vs self-respect) is on page, but the decisive choice to report Mira is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the change feels lightly rather than forcibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to “read scars” is concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (digging, pressing opal to skin) flows from the car-crash wound. Interiority keeps returning to bodily sensation, avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation—bandaging after vision—pays the cost of reopening grief, earned by the opal’s reveal. Only minor slip: the telepathy quirk is declared, not dramatized as contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory yearning to both hoard and release love is dramatized through tactile psychometry. The moment she presses the film to her palm crystallizes her stakes and flaws. Secondary pressure is absent, yet her micro-choice to descend with the strip earns credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s desire to recover lost creativity is cleanly dramatized through the astrolabe alignment and deliberate surrender; the moment her fingers tremble over the brass rings shows embodied cost. Interior contradiction is thin—no active self-doubt interrupts the lyric trajectory—so the “cage” shatters more by cosmic fiat than by earned internal fracture. Still, her micro-choice to lie down and invite risk of failure gives credible hinge for the release.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s dreamless hollowness is rendered through bodily detail (clutching the clock, “voice rough from disuse”) and the final micro-choice—pressing the clock to the crate—externalizes his motive. Internal contradiction is present yet subtle: he yearns to seed possibility while accepting his own vacancy. The earned cost is the lingering hollow behind the “faint smile,” a credible endurance stance. Voice stays spare and specific, never drifting into diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s yearning is stated repeatedly but never tested by an opposing want; the gear and hum nudge him forward, yet every beat is acquiescence, not choice. Interiority drifts into lyrical tags—“buzzing with fragments of insight”—rather than embodied contradiction. The final “wild frontier” opens because the forest gifts it, not because Elias risks anything or forfeits an alternative. No cost is legible on the page, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s fear-of-leash interiority is concrete early (“the leash was her fear, not his chain”), but the shift from passive follower to active guide is declared rather than dramatized on-page; star-stamp card acts as external proxy for courage, so the final cost feels symbolic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s muteness and past choir trauma are viscerally anchored in the bolt discovery; the pocketing micro-choice crystallizes his new stance. Interiority stays concrete—“fragile melody hummed in his chest” bodies emotion without label-speak. The final endurance costs him the fantasy of restored song, earned by the bolt’s physical weight against skin. Choir-as-family backstory is kept ≤20 % and cued by the object itself, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s calm, ruminative purpose is consistent, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“slow ember”) rather than dramatized in a moment of wavering; the final activation feels pre-decided, so the cost reads symbolic, not personally paid. Micro-choices (picking ink, writing marginalia) are present yet interchangeable with any careful scribe, so titanic identity does not shape tactics. The regally unpretentious trait is stated repeatedly but never forces a trade-off on the page. Closure satisfies Earned Stasis only at the mythic level; character-level price is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s grief-borne solitude is vivid in the coral-memory beats, but her present-tense desire (“to discover why some paths disappear”) is declared, not dramatized until the overlay scene; the final smile feels prepaid by abstract determination more than by a prior micro-choice that visibly costs her. Interiority leans on stock phrases—“haunted her dreams,” “motivation burned quietly”—without embodied contradiction in the moment of discovery. The tapping ritual is specific and inherited, yet its emotional function plateaus; it steadies rather than complicates her stance, so the Earned Stasis carries only faint cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and awkward confidence are embodied in curling toes and squared shoulders, grounding her motivation. The contradiction between her self-conscious body and decisive stride is dramatized, not labeled. Her final hum with the stones crystallizes an earned shift from scavenger to signal-caller, with the cost of abandoning anonymity. Interiority stays concrete, though the rebellion’s losses are summarized more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s insurgent past and intent-to-evolve motive are declared rather than shown in moment-to-moment contradiction; she never faces a live trade-off that forces her to question or test that motive. The choice to unseal the embryo is single-track once the kite is found, so the interior tension flattens. Cost is asserted (“her rebellion…bloomed”) but not dramatized on her body or relationships. Still, the telepathic quirk is anchored in one sensory beat and fuels the discovery, keeping her above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s embodied grief and botanical talent are vivid; the photograph and orchid anchor her contradictory impulses. The final integration of loss into forward motion is earned and costly. Minor therapy-speak (“somatic markers”) slightly blurs interiority at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, hollow reflection, and deliberate severing of memory-threads embody a man split between despair and the need to remake himself. The contradiction between wanting to paint souls and fearing the darkness he must enter is dramatized in every micro-choice. The final renunciation of past failures carries a felt cost: the ache remains luminescent, not erased. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis (“necessary darkness”) keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s serene anger is embodied in micro-choices—kneeling to trace ink, activating the drone, vanishing via ink—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The albino tracker’s traits (pale skin, crimson eyes) are not labels but constraints that shape tactics in bright desert light. Interiority stays specific: “quiet fury born from the crisis” is shown through deliberate, risky moves rather than stated. The final disappearance is an earned renunciation that forecloses direct confrontation, costing her immediate revenge for deeper knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—guardian of dormancy vs. smuggler of truth—is dramatized through trembling fingers and the decisive upload; the cost (treason, betrayal of her order) is felt on the page. The “bravely conflicted” trait is embodied, not labeled, and drives the final irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist stance and “senselessly perceptive” gift are shown through tactile ritual, not label; the embedded petal/knife beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, yet the father-daughter contradiction is mostly summarized rather than enacted in scene, muting the final wound.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s calm resolve is consistently embodied—measured breaths, steady reeling—so the “cool-headed” trait lives in scene, not label. The buried-grief motive is anchored to a single childhood image, then transliterated into blue pulses of light, keeping interiority concrete. No contradictory impulses are shown under pressure; the stance is admirably steady but emotionally one-note, capping depth at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “devotedly observant” trait is asserted, not embodied; her only micro-choice is waving the pen nib. Quill’s panic is generic, not cousin-specific. Interior contradiction is missing; she never doubts her own family’s guilt. The rosewood pen’s personal history is told, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—wanting to silence guilt yet clinging to a hope of reconnection—is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (wiring the amber, tracing her tattoo). Guilt’s transformation into forgiveness is earned via tangible on-page cost: the firmware’s final translation that reweights her past.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s whimsicality and social perceptiveness are shown through tactile sand-play and tactical placements, but interior contradiction is muted; we hear her motives summarized rather than felt as clashing impulses under pressure. The final “smile” is a label, not an embodied cost, so the renunciation reads lightly rather than foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle empathy vs. steel-clad resolve—drives every beat; the retrocognitive visions are embodied (kneeling, palm on stone, breath fogging) rather than abstract. Her forgiveness of the arsonists is dramatized as a micro-choice that costs her residual hatred, supplying visible price. Minor slip: “gentle radical” is named but never translated into idiosyncratic speech or gesture, so the label hovers above the skin instead of living in it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eliza’s synesthetic interiority is vivid and specific; her grief is embodied in “silence that tasted of ash.” The ghost’s hunger for an encore is clear, yet his sudden pivot to mentor role feels lightly motivated—no contradiction or cost inside the relationship is dramatized. Micro-choices (taking the coin, mirroring the dance) track, but the final emotional lift is voiced rather than earned through visible trade-off. Still, her flaw (escapist nostalgia) complicates the choice and remains unresolved, satisfying “earned stasis.”

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s affectionate skepticism is enacted in every beat—she hugs while doubting, proposes a bodily alternative to pills, and her tactile micro-choices (hand on solar plexus, scar trace) force Theo’s stance to shift. The internal contradiction is live, embodied, and drives the final renunciation of chemical telepathy; cost is felt when she trades her static-shock skin for a shared canvas. One decimal off perfect only because Theo’s prior bootleg dose is recalled rather than dramatized, blurring the depth of his longing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sensory mapping and the fossil’s pulse are embodied—but the “voice of the unknown” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the final stance feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s yearning to free others from fate is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of buttons and hourglasses; the final choice to carry the jar outward shows earned change. Interiority is vivid, though “quietly inspired” is repeated as label rather than dramatized contradiction. No secondary character pressure on page, so relationship crucible untested.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. daring—are embodied in her tactile snow-search and the micro-choice to kneel at the bluff’s edge; the reunion with Marcus crystallizes a cost (shared betrayal) that reconfigures their bond. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The pillbox and codes act as extensions of her psyche, not props.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—fear of endless duty vs. longing for clarity—shown through tactile needle-work and ambient listening. The micro-choice to mend only what matters distills his arc; cost is the abandonment of inherited burdens. No stock phrasing; voice stays specific to gloom-hill stoicism.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s zen calm and “phototropic” kindness are stated more than dramatized; the lantern-vision beat shows micro-choice (holding the glass steady) but no contradictory impulse under pressure, so interiority stays flat. The final insight arrives as summary, not embodied cost—no felt residue in hands or stance—so the arc reads observational rather than crucible-forged. Character functions adequately for an allegorical vignette, but lacks the contradiction or stakes-tested flaw required for high-band interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers linger on petals, her breath syncs with oars—yet the final resolve feels slightly pre-announced rather than wrested from live contradiction. The rosebush loss and father’s absence anchor motive, but the pivot from grief to communal garden plan is more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior arc from brittle isolation to earned self-reliance is clear and embodied; fragile awakenings solidify into decisive flight. Micro-choices (tracing the sundial gnomon, aligning the solstice light) show hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s emotional arc registers: she arrives adrift, recognizes her own letter in the spiral, and chooses re-engagement. Motivation is explicit but generic (“thread that connects all things”) and never complicated by contradictory impulse; interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than embodied tension under pressure. Her one micro-choice—opening the envelope and walking toward Liora—earns the reunion, yet the cost is asserted (“no longer adrift”) rather than dramatized on her body or future options. Voice remains consistent but never surprises; competence outweighs visible flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent: to outwit cosmic tricksters before chaos blooms. Her cautious hope collides with gritty resolve in the moment she chooses sub-sonic interference (“her fingers danced over the controls”), showing embodied cost (Harlan staggers, crowds falter). Interiority stays anchored to specific stimuli—charts, dials, the oscilloscope’s dance—rather than generic awe. One flaw: the final beat leans on “honest silence” as summary instead of letting her body register the victory, so the cost is legible but not fully incarnate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in every micro-choice—her tremor, the steady fingers on the map, the refusal to lunge blindly—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “wistful rebellion” shorthand rather than concrete sensation, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s face-blind empathy and methodical art practice are vivid, but interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“awaken dormant empathy”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final sketch choice is earned yet the cost feels intellectual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s ancestor-quest motive is vivid; her trembling fingers and locked-door decision embody the “nervously confident” tag. The copper nail beat—decoder then talisman—shows micro-choice altering tactics. Yet no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; emotion stays singular, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to “never” versus the flake’s invitation to cross—are dramatized in the scaffold-map beat; the final bow-stroke on the arch costs him his lifelong alibi and is earned by the hitchhiker’s vanish and the glass relic’s pulse. Interiority stays concrete, tied to fiddle muscle-memory and mountain wind. Flaw (scarred hands) complicates rather than decorates. Only minor gait: the ash-of-never phrase flirts with label-speak yet is immediately embodied by the bow he lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s trauma and inheritance are rendered through taut micro-choices (staking the circus bills on route surveys, maintaining composure when rivals appear); the contradiction between reverence and rejection of his father’s legacy is embodied rather than exposited, and his final renunciation carries an earned cost that forecloses reckless repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s yearning to decode the temple inscriptions is explicit, but the interior contradiction between solitary scholarship and communal healing is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene; her “heals with words” trait appears as label until the dream-vision, so the cost of that gift is still abstract. The micro-choice to weave empathy into the cosmic staircase moment is present yet floats in dream logic without risking anything concrete on her waking body or future. Mentor’s spectral lantern is a beat of pressure, but because it repeats advice already given in the telegram, the relationship doesn’t tilt. Closure lands as insight, not irrevocable renunciation, so the change feels intellectual rather than a path foreclosed at personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elowen’s guarded nature and gift for finding lost things are anchored early and pay off when she claims the seed, but interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“raw, unvarnished guilt”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s visionary role is vividly rooted (pun intended) and her arc—twisting prophecy into present action—earns the mantle; interiority stays tactile, not didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s fierce-gentle paradox is embodied when she “pressed the card against a root… whispering interpretations,” a micro-choice that fuses tenderness with reckless resolve. The interior contradiction stays live: hope vs macabre bargain, enacted in tactile beats. Thorne’s guarded curiosity supplies status pressure that forces her to double-down, cementing the arc. Only the family-fire backstory is told not shown, muting full cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jack’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the grille cloth vs. wanting to hurl it away—are dramatized in one tactile beat, giving us interior conflict in scene. The micro-choice to pocket the cloth at the end costs him the illusion of final severance and is credibly prepared. Emotion is embodied (trembling hand, frayed weave against thigh) rather than labeled. Still, the stance shift feels more stated than tested: we’re told “longing softens into resolve” rather than shown a new risk taken.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of the seed, the ache of “touching distance”—but the mentor’s absence is told more than dramatized, muting the cost of her haunted ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s shifting form and quiet desperation are embodied in the moon-phase mechanic, but interiority remains more atmospheric than contradictory; the final act of “smelting” a smelt into ink is a vivid micro-choice that earns the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s shift from detached assessor to redemptive agent is sketched more than dramatized; the shell’s pull and the instant oath are declared rather than embodied. Interior contradiction is absent—no moment where professional skepticism collides with sudden faith—so the final motivation feels imposed. Still, the micro-choice to pry the pearl and press it into stone is specific and irreversible, giving a modest earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority leans on stock phrases (“raw solace,” “frayed nerves”) and diagnostic self-labels that dampen embodied contradiction; the accordion beat late provides a micro-choice but the forgiveness turn is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the shift feels pre-decided. Still, the river-observer vocation filters perception consistently and the brother-guilt motive stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract (“exhilaration bubbled… wariness of one who had chased illusions”); no embodied contradiction in-scene. Micro-choices (wind watch, jot notes) advance plot yet never sharpen a value hierarchy or flaw. Final stance is wonder, not renunciation; cost is mentioned (“weight… fulfilled—for now”) but not dramatized on her body or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interior ache is embodied through tactile handling of artifacts; her mulberry longing is dramatized in the violin beat and leaks into her final stance. Contradictory impulses—dream vs empire—are present in scene, forcing a crystallized choice that forecloses the archive path. The change feels earned via prior causality and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—beautifier of corpses yet facing her own erasure—grounds every move; the emerald chip forces a tangible micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion stays specific (“chip warming in her palm like a living ember”) without therapeutic self-labeling. The final renunciation costs her existence and is causally prepared; still, the absence of any second character keeps relationship crucible untested, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s caretaker identity is embodied through tactile ritual (scalloping) and the final interior turn—accepting cyclical rebirth in lieu of static “contentment”—is earned. However, her brother’s betrayal is only summarised, so forgiveness cost is asserted, not dramatised; that weakens the emotional price anchoring her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her desire to “welcome nuance into certainty” is concrete, embodied in the mirror shard and the act of unhooking. The contradictory pull between escape and self-interrogation is kept active in scene. Thorne remains a cipher; his “sincerely insincere” mask is asserted not shown, so his pressure on her feels stylised rather than personal. Still, her final micro-choice carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is richly textured and stays anchored to her paradoxical goal (“to teach vanishing to appear”). Micro-choices—selecting the stone, syncing breath with ripples—externalize the scientific-mystic fusion without exposition dump. Motive is consistently forwarded: every beat serves the surrender-to-reverse-age obsession. Flaw is lightly present (hubris of withheld truth), but no interior contradiction actively complicates the climax; still, the visible cost is her accepting unspoken personal risk, earning the Earned Stasis close.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s centuries-long endurance and the embodied harmonics in her veins give her a singular, weathered interiority; the final press of the arrowhead to her forehead crystallizes her earned renunciation of physical wandering, sealing the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s underachiever status is embodied in fizzling spells and frozen tears, but the interior voice drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“her mage’s heart no longer underachieving”) rather than live contradiction. The final awakening is credible, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his childhood vow, the “luminous vows” dimming under routine, and the embodied chill of the sea all reveal contradictory impulses. The final choice to surface with the orb is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the spent key tag). Minor slip: the synesthetic quest is stated more than dramatized in scene, slightly blunting the internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “quiet enthusiasm” pulses against stellar doubt in every beat. The casting of lots and the final sweep of coins into the void are micro-choices that crystallize her hierarchy of values. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses the safety of past symbols. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“her purpose locked in harmony”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual—handling the atlas, channeling light through Lira’s crystal—yet his contradictory drive to both mourn and redeem remains vivid. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final pocketing of the crystal crystallizes a micro-choice that re-orders his hierarchy of values. The only minor slip is a touch of grandiloquence in “name them all, and find me in the naming,” which edges toward therapeutic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s lukewarm magic and brittle devotion are embodied through tactile micro-choices—timing drops, adjusting for wind—that reveal contradictory impulses (faith vs doubt). His interiority stays concrete, never slipping into label-speak. The final toll and returning moisture crystallize his earned stance with visible cost. Only the off-stage Lira feels slightly abstract, a minor cap.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s vigilance and measured humanity are woven into every beat; his grandfather’s photograph becomes the hinge that forces the communal reconciliation. Interiority stays grounded, and the final renunciation of inherited bitterness is earned with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (logic vs. intuition) are dramatized in the crystal-flame beat. The final choice to embrace wonder is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the crystal’s loss). Minor slip: “secretly sentimental” is asserted more than embodied in dialogue or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers trembling, muscle memory guiding the buckle—yet the contradictory impulses (doubt vs duty) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of doubt is credible but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kai’s numbness-driven motive is explicit and constant; the micro-choice to merge with the duplicate is credible, embodied, and paid for with instant emotional torrent. No contradictory interior beats undercut him, and the closing crack of feeling proves the arc. However, his pre-dojo past is delivered in explanatory blocks rather than triggered memory, muting the interior contradiction that could have lifted this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s inventor-trait stays consistent, but interiority drifts into echoing abstracts (“safeguarding space for innovation” repeated) rather than fresh contradiction; no embodied emotion undercuts his calm. Micro-choice at the seed-planting is present yet cost remains prospective, not paid, so the beat feels safe. Relationship crucible is absent (single POV), within scope but limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory grief-driven resolve is embodied in every gesture; the “mournful eagerness” is dramatized through the physical strain of starting each blower. His interiority is specific—half-sung lullabies crack on the notes his wife once carried—yet the final choice to flood the tunnel with wind feels inevitable and costly, foreclosing the option to keep grief untouched. The only drag is a slight drift toward therapeutic self-diagnosis in the phrase “tending to the unspoken,” which momentarily abstracts the embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s contradictory impulses—feral instinct vs. ordered guardian—are embodied in every beat; the final choice to wear the pendant crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One minor slip: “dimensionally homesick” leans label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s hopeless-to-vivified arc is embodied in trembling fingers, cracked laughter, and micro-adjustments at the bench; the “stoically sensitive” trait drives every iterative decision. Interior contradiction is alive in the same breath: reverence for the crozier and the need to smash it. Cost arrives in the grandfather relic’s destruction and the church bond severed—felt, not declared. Flaw remains credible: he almost quits, hopelessness still nips, no tidy sainthood.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interior motive—“find the beginning in every ending”—is stated repeatedly but never sharpened into a concrete want she could lose. The ritual of listing biases is shown, yet no contradictory impulse collides with it; the choice to “let go” is risk-free, so no cost is legible. She finishes exactly where she started: hopeful interpreter with a new reading. Earned stasis requires a visible price; here the only toll is abstract “assumptions” cast into a gorge we never see strike bottom.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s optimism is stated repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulse; the hourglass moment should force a visible crack in his zeal, yet he stays buoyant without cost. Interiority leans on stock phrases (“heart swelling,” “mind racing”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—radioing across folds—feels externally imposed by lore rather than driven from within.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s solitary obsession is rendered with fevered specificity—his fingers “steady despite the feverish haze,” the thread “coiled like a dormant serpent”—and the interior contradiction (craving connection while engineering illusion) stays active in every micro-choice. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned stasis—he remains alone but now knowingly bound to “gritty, unyielding weave”—carries visible cost in the cracked mirrors. Memory alterations could read as convenient, yet each is tethered to a concrete weaving act, keeping knowledge states character-bound. Voice stays architect-cold even at climax, avoiding therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to bridge abyss and sky is clear and embodied through the anchor-link lessons, but her interiority stays slightly generalized; the “balanced curiosity” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s vocation (“contact tracer for hearts”) is vivid and stakes her motivation at once, yet the interior contradiction promised never surfaces; she never hesitates, misreads a pulse, or pays a visible price for her curiosity. The final “assurance” to Mira carries no bodily cost or moment of dread, so the arc is flat. The profession is memorable, but the character feels like a flawless conduit for plot rather than a pressured person.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is embodied in ragged breaths and tightening corridors; his vow to the unremembered is dramatized by the codex micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak. The final renunciation (codex dissolution) costs him the relic and his mentor’s promise, earning closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to mend Elias vs. accept exile) act simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to cut her finger and guide the ink is specific and stakes-raising. Flaw: Elias’s ghost speaks in slightly therapeutic cadence (“Your anxiety rises”), a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elar’s copper-veined body and quiet articulation are embodied in every beat; the ache of loss glows in his veins and drives the final endurance. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the cost of the curse is felt in his flaring skin. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the self-conflict is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s bitterness and quest for truth are vivid, but the metamorphosis leap feels slightly under-motivated; the cosmic-joke turn lands more as concept than embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction or embodied cost; she never doubts, tires, or chooses against self-interest. The locust shell functions as an external talisman rather than a pressure point that forces a value hierarchy. Because the orchard’s transformation is externally willed through music rather than paid for by a visible sacrifice, the arc feels warmly symbolic rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s respectfully rebellious stance is clear and embodied—every subtle mail-drop risk carries felt cost—yet interior contradiction could be sharper at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s silence is embodied through tactile action and the final sung note, but the interior contradiction between muteness and sudden song is only gestured at, not dramatized in-scene; the cost of breaking silence is felt yet abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s “sanely eccentric” flourish is convincing and embodied (footnote-hoarding, silk ritual) and her private quest gates the climax; yet interiority stays safe, lacking jagged contradiction under peak visual rapture—credibly idiosyncratic, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clutch the dream vs. release it—drives every micro-choice; the final hand-lift of renunciation is earned. Brother-loss backstory is kept under 20 % and anchored to present stimuli. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. One slip: “she understood” is mild label-speak at closure, blunting embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied, specific, and contradictory (fear vs longing); a micro-choice (handing the hair) triggers the revelation that recharges closure. Motivation shifts from passive grief to active resolve, showing earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and memory-hunger are vivid, but interiority drifts toward abstract nostalgia rather than embodied contradiction; the final recovery feels more granted than earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Gut-punch interiority: Elara’s reflexive heel-scraping recoil, calloused fingertip on tea-leaf fractals, the soft-blade “It doesn’t” all die-cast her combative tenderness. Lir’s arc from cornered-animal flinch to nod that loosens the shadow is micro-observed without label-speak. The final forward step pays the exile cost she hoarded—resilience mentored is resilience spent—under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to “preserve the color of wonder” is vivid and embodied, but her interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical abstraction rather than concrete contradiction. The final planting act is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the closure test. Secondary characters appear only as recipients of succor, so relationship crucible is absent. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with minor drift into poetic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s guilt-driven compulsion is visceral and embodied; the trembling hands, salt-stiff fibers, and whispered confession keep interiority concrete. The contradiction between her stated duty to “ground restless spirits” and her private wish to erase her own guilt is active in every tug of the needle. Yet the brother’s spectral “eyes pleading through the cracks” is the only moment he exerts relational pressure; his agency is symbolic, not interactive, so the relationship crucible feels one-sided. Still, her final silence after the secret is out reads as credible renunciation with cost: she inherits the quiet she once feared.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven empathy is embodied in tactile map work and silent film comparison; the final crossing into the chapel crystallizes his father’s absence as a felt cost. Interior contradiction—yearning vs. dread—remains vivid without diagnostic self-talk. Micro-choices (latch turned, door creaked) align with motive and foreclose retreat. One slip: “methodically curious” is asserted more than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quietly analytic trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (teasing cables, brushing seaweed, pocketing the note) that externalize grief and curiosity; the contradiction between intellectual control and emotional surrender is present but interior summary (“he felt the weight…”) occasionally abstracts the wound. The snow-globe talisman anchors personal cost, and the final whispered line shows earned renunciation, yet the on-page link between the trait and the decisive release could be sharper under water-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her “driftingly alert” stance and embodied reaction to the ghost’s pulse show contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to merge ghost with mural is earned by her established vocation of voicing the overlooked, and the cost (loss of solitude, irreversible fusion) is felt. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-talk. Minor slip: “seldom-heard” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s “warmly inquisitive” stance is consistent, yet every beat is observation—no micro-choice alters her course. The diary reads her rather than her reading it, so agency stays flat and no cost is incurred. Because she never risks or forfeits anything, the arc lands as curiosity rather than character change.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief is palpable and embodied in the tactile handling of brass, journal, and telescope; the interior contradiction—scientist vs. bereft husband—drives every micro-choice. Yet the final beat (“he had proven it”) is asserted, not dramatized; no new risk, forfeiture, or visible cost crystallizes on the page, so the arc lands just short of earned renunciation/change.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s face-blindness and fractal aesthetic are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the instant she rubs the coin’s grooves she re-prioritizes tactics, proving interior contradiction under pressure. The final vow to carry the book shows credible renunciation with visible cost (the mural left to die). No second character on page, so relationship crucible exempt. Brief “her breath caught” skirts diagnostic-speak but is instantly grounded in tactile action, keeping the slip sub-deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid—she “cross-references the symbols” with a “dog-eared” phrasebook—but interior contradiction is missing; we never feel her fear of error or envy of the laughing crew, so the final triumph feels preordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara feels layered—lunar-eclipse locksmith premise drives her solitude, fear of sorrow, and compulsive need to mend. Interior contradiction between fixing locks and locking away feelings is embodied in mirror reflections. Protagonist passivity lifts only at uncapping; earlier meandering hurts urgency. Final uncapping choice earns renunciation of her former stance with visible cost (synced heartbeat timepiece).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's nurturing directive provides a clear through-line to the climax; the ghost’s gentle intervention is well-motivated, though the living characters' interiority is less sharply etched.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her tactile communion with the puppet head and the clock reveals a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—adjusting the clock to gentle fade rather than doom—carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Minor drift toward lyrical self-diagnosis in “bruised awe” refrain prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s reluctant-caretaker identity is vivid in scene-level micro-choices (expert nut-trace planning, self-deprecating errors) and motivates every beat; internal contradiction visible but occasionally lapses into abstract self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s grief/regret is embodied through tactile contact with the chrysalis and river foam; the interior contradiction between scientific pattern-seeking and emotional avoidance is palpable. The phone-call beat, however, collapses into therapeutic paraphrase (“Let me visit, hear your music. Let's translate this apartness…”) that over-articulates what the foaming water has already shown, softening the cost. Micro-choices are visible but the final articulation of motive is spoon-fed rather than left in charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s hunger to locate “where stories begin” is the engine every micro-action services; the orphaned-backstory void is tallied, incised, and finally answered on the page. Interiority stays concrete—fingers tracing fog-stone, slate warming under palm—without therapeutic self-labeling. The final smile carries credible cost: the spent moonlight bottle and the reopened shop codify her renunciation of endless search in favor of serving others’ blank pages. Only absence of embodied contradiction under peak pressure keeps it from the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, absorbing regret—but the moment she kneels at the pool the text tells “remorse flooded her” rather than showing a contradictory impulse in scene. The final absorption of orbs is a decisive micro-choice, yet the cost (physical chill, psychic overload) is asserted, not embodied. Still, her chef-sensorium is specific and steers every beat; no stock phrases intrude. Enough motive clarity and sensorial particularity to clear the 7-band, but not yet the 8-band where we would feel the orbs scraping her soul in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority stays lyrical but concrete; Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear of rejection vs. decisive empathy) are staged in the same beat when she oils the gears while humming. The pine-cone weight works as an embodied micro-choice that externalizes her hierarchy of values. One interior cliché (“heart a choral library...”) keeps it from the 9-band. Closure cost is legible: her talisman is now lighter because she has spent some of her own vulnerability to buy communal song.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s helix-minded obsession and buried-ember motive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (fractal-mapping fingers, neural interface activation). Contradictory impulses—precision vs. chaos—surface in the same beats, and the final smile carries visible cost: he has rewired himself into a “guardian of what was forsaken,” foreclosing normal cognition. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, synaptic lightning and canyon whispers externalize the struggle. The only minor slip is a touch of grandiose phrasing (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) that edges toward thesis rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s obsessive curiosity is vivid through ink-stained fingers and the “latent blaze” refrain, but interiority leans on abstract labels (“prism-minded”) rather than contradictory impulses acted out in scene; the final ascent is motivated yet cost is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elowen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “mapping the fractures born of storms and neglect” shows embodied empathy. The contradiction between her need to heal silence and the risk of reopening wounds is dramatized in the act of strumming. The final choice to keep playing despite the cracks widening carries visible cost. Minor slip: “symphonically minded” is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s self-exiled persona materializes in precise micro-choices (rolling the stone, kneeling to translate silence under time pressure); the dented worry stone externalizes regret while his final re-configures exile into purposeful agency—earned and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s pacifist-inventor duality is vividly sketched through tactile micro-choices (tuning the clasp with “listener” intent), but interiority drifts into performed lyricism (“eclectic heart fuller”) that abstracts rather than embodies final cost; the diary’s grief is felt, yet his resultant vow is declared, not dramatized, so the interior change registers as sentiment rather than paid-for stance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s ambition and olfactory sensitivity are embodied in every beat—her nausea at the bloom’s stench, her kneeling to journalize, her refusal to flee. Contradictory impulses (revulsion vs. resolve) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation of pure ambition for tempered wisdom. The cost—her sensory torment and recalibrated ambition—is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her grip on the controls, her racing heart—but interiority stays surface-level; no contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure. The final choice to safeguard the arrow tip is motivated, yet the cost feels external rather than internal. Competence slightly outweighs struggle; the inversion never truly endangers her stance or values.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is embodied in every beat—he kneels for the patch, climbs for vantage, logs data—yet interiority stays surface-level; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the arc feels single-track rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s synesthetic gift and monastic purpose are vividly interiorized; the amber sheet and mallet become extensions of her will. Yet her only real choice—when to strike—remains a single beat, so the “hierarchy of values” is more stated than tested. The smile at the end feels slightly unearned because no contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes her quest. Still, the embodied sensorium keeps her from abstraction and lifts the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and specific; flaws (iron-grip vs. vulnerability) drive key beats and charge the ending’s renunciation. The earned stasis—yielding instead of guarding—feels inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory drive—borrowing personalities to map emotion—drives every beat; the final renunciation of formulaic empathy is earned by the prior collapse of her borrowed selves, with visible cost in the torn broadsheet.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s trembling hand on the pendant and his resolve to pass it on crystallize a credible shift from fear to stewardship; the shepherd’s transformation under the pendant’s hum shows the mentor’s legacy living through embodied choice rather than abstract tribute.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath fogging the glass, the prism warming with her tears—but the “truthful lies” epiphany is delivered as label-speak rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered, but her contradictory impulses (cling vs. release) are asserted rather than dramatized in real time; the final sacrifice is credible because the loom has been made synonymous with her life’s work, yet the bead’s agency feels given rather than earned by character flaw or choice. Still, her stoically sparkling refusal to dim is consistently embodied in gesture and threads, and the decision to unravel decades of tapestry carries visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—meek yet stubbornly resolved—stays concrete through bodily micro-choices (wrapping silk, measured hammer taps). Quiet determination turns to costly action, but the epiphany beat (“confusion swirled…”) drifts into label-speak, muting embodied cost. A single POV piece, so relationship bullets N/A. Meek trait drives the decisive descent, earns the final stance; still, emotional layering flattens in the climactic shaft vigil, keeping it just below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s cyclically spontaneous intuition drives every pivot; the withheld-truth motive threads through her micro-choices, and her renunciation at the end lands as earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s reticence and observant nature are embodied in quiet micro-choices—adjusting the stone stack, pocketing the sea glass—but the interior contradiction between solitude and inherited duty is more summarized than dramatized in scene. The final vow to protect the chain is credible yet feels slightly under-cooked because we never witness an explicit moment of internal cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Herald’s lone-puppet mastery keeps agency clear, but interiority stays cosmic-superhero generic (“shadowed elation,” “joy at creation’s edge”) rather than embodied; no bodily sensation contradicts the grand mood. His final laugh/self-extinguish counts as a renunciation with cost, yet the prophecy-of-his-fade is reported, not felt through trembling grip or frayed breath. Still, single-POV discipline holds and micro-steers map motive-to-action. Enough for mid-band credibility, short of lived-in contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—guardian-of-vats vs. story-magnet hunger—is stated, not dramatized; no mid-scene choice tests her new pulse. The donor memories arrive as a packaged info-dump rather than an on-page micro-choice that changes tactics. Closure is an announced rather than embodied shift; cost remains conceptual, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with the trees and his method of “mapping dreams” give him a distinct interiority, but the story keeps him largely in passive observation; the final smile feels more symbolic than earned from a visible internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her trembling fingers on the mica window show the cost of memory. Yet her interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“fractured mosaic of half-remembered lives”) that blurs contradiction and stalls micro-choices. The final song-ritual is earned, but earlier beats lack visible struggle that would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sketched with crisp internal contradiction—recluse who actively chooses to reach out—and his micro-choices (hiding invitation, descending stairs) flow from empathetic motive; still, one-note reclusive profile in final third keeps it shy of full three-dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt-driven need for redemption is embodied in tactile micro-choices—planting seeds, breaking bread—yet the interior contradiction between her past betrayal and present gentleness is more summarized than dramatized in scene, keeping her final poise slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in the lantern-slide calibration and frequency sampling, but interior contradiction is thin; she never risks failure or questions her oath, so the arc is flat. The final beat re-stabilizes rather than reconfigures her stance—no visible cost or path foreclosed. Still, the occupational micro-choices are specific and consistent, keeping her above mid-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s loyalty and dread are palpable, but interiority slips into summary (“curiously steadfast”) rather than embodied contradiction. The watch-fob beats show micro-choice, yet the final cost feels narrated rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s skepticism and taste-shift quirk are vivid, but her final “might carry weather” epiphany feels externally bestowed rather than earned by prior micro-choices; interior contradiction is shown early yet not fully leveraged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—charcoal-stained fingers trembling, memory flooding with tactile detail. The contradiction between his mnemonic gift and creative paralysis is dramatized in every beat, culminating in the earned choice to open the safe and reclaim his art. No therapy-speak; the cost is felt when he confronts the “bottled visions.” Minor slip: the phrase “inevitable calling” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering vanished candor—drives every move; her evolving interiority under pressure is concrete (“her gilded leaves vibrant once more” shows earned change). The lie-sensing gift is dramatized twice with visible cost (brown curling, Kael’s exposure), anchoring agency. Missing: micro-choice beat inside the Vault that would crystallize internal contradiction at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet stays abstract—“quiet forge of sound,” “vivid spectrum fading”—so his contradictory impulses are announced, not dramatized in a single pressure-cooked moment. The seasonal muteness is evocative but never once interferes with a concrete choice; he simply watches the sculpture work. Because the final beat is a generalized nod rather than a costly micro-choice, the arc feels vicarious, not personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—tending roses vs. purging static—are dramatized in real time; the burn sequence embodies cost via blistering synthetic skin. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Final stance crystallizes through earned renunciation of total erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s discerning eye and “listening” stance are shown through concrete micro-choices (sitting, following stories, prizing the locket); the quiet but visible cost—accepting others’ pain without defensiveness—lands in the final image. Interiority stays specific to her thrift-store idiom, avoiding label-speak. One contradictory impulse (curiosity vs. fear of intrusion) could have been sharpened under escalating pressure; as is, motivation is steady but not yet compounding risk.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief and resolve are embodied in the dance and the dice—but the sister’s restoration feels slightly external, softening the cost. The “calm defiance” trait is consistent, yet the final beat leans on holographic spectacle rather than a deeper internal renunciation. Still, the contradiction between vulnerability and strength is dramatized, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored motivation and gradual reclaiming of his wife’s memory feel lived and earned, with micro-choices (kneeling, digging, lantern steadiness) tracking his emotional arc. Flaws are minor: one line of premature diagnostic-speak (“a fragment of memory, deleted”) and a slight over-articulation of the memory-return epiphany. Still, his Earned Stasis at the end—accepting the cost of remembering—lands under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elar’s conflict feels embodied: inner peace clashing with high-stakes purpose. Motive is dramatized—not told—through the ritual choice, showing hierarchy of values. Final “earned stillness” stance is credible, with visible cost. Micro-moments reveal flaws under stress, avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied and consistent; her micro-choice to press the seal under meteors crystallizes her arc. Thorne’s guarded warmth and “mysterious familiarity” create credible status tension. Both characters’ flaws—her naïve hunger for secrets, his protective secrecy—drive the final trust-gift. Relationship shift from wary neighbors to co-custodians of the building’s voice is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's skepticism is asserted but never tested in scene; she pivots from doubt to resolve without a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. "Ghostly resolve" is declared, not dramatized. Interiority leans on lyrical labels ("tragically radiant," "luminous sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. The archiving beat shows agency, yet the emotional stakes remain abstract because her own quarantined memories are summarized, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to the empire vs. the need to excise its rot—are embodied in her trembling fingers and the bead of blood she draws with the thorn. The interiority is character-specific, never generic, and her final act of unlinking is earned by the prior decade of calibrated betrayals. The cost is visible: the thorn’s prick and the blood that mingles with the marble’s glow. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s grief-propelled vow is clear, but interiority drifts into poetic paraphrase (“reed-like sorrow”) that keeps emotion at arm’s length; no embodied contradiction is shown under pressure, and the climactic decision to sacrifice her echo is declared rather than rendered as a micro-choice with bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing for “purity” is evocative but abstract; it never collides with a concrete counter-desire on the page, so her final smile feels bestowed rather than earned. Her physical scars are mentioned but not once activated in a present-tense choice, so interior contradiction stays theoretical. The absence of another live character keeps relational pressure offstage; what remains is a lone obsession that deepens but never visibly forks.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Hiroshi’s interiority is textured—calloused hands tracing knots, the whisk’s memory—but his contradictory impulses remain summary (“refusing to let night’s veil dim pursuit”) rather than enacted in a single pressured beat. No live relationship or secondary character tests him, so the promised “philosopher” is only a reflective lens; the final resolve is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. Meets baseline embodiment, misses crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s drive to “excavate truth” is declared early and threads every beat; the micro-choice to pocket a shard of the crystal literalizes her cost. Yet her interiority never cracks—no contradictory impulse or embodied fear under the Geiger-silent trees—so the renunciation feels efficient rather than wrenched.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his breath fogging, palm on cobalt glass—but the “lonely visionary” label is asserted more than dramatized. His motives (forge dawn via radio prophecy) are clear, yet the shift from passive listener to active prophet happens largely off-stage, muting the cost. Still, embodied emotion and micro-choices under storm pressure keep him distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s longing to “translate between generations” is stated early and re-activated by the music-box find, giving his jar-pouring sequence clear motive. Interiority stays concrete—sand on tears, pockets jingling—yet the emotional turn hinges on an untested quasi-magic (sound → gears) rather than on a visible contradiction he must navigate. The final beat earns a quiet cost (tears, lifted weight), but the lack of an embodied obstacle or interior dissent keeps the arc thinner than the lyric overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s guardianship motive is clear, but the “logically emotional” trait stays abstract—no moment shows logic and emotion colliding to produce a costly micro-choice. His interiority drifts into lyrical self-summary (“profound, visceral yearnings that no equation could fully map”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The beat where he “logically charted the harmonic convergence” while “emotionally enraptured” is told, not dramatized; we don’t feel the tug-of-war steering his tactics. The ending stance is legible, yet the absence of a visible personal cost keeps the change lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “restrained wildness” and “quiet force” are shown through gesture and stance. Thorne’s arc from clenched fists to patient sketching is credible, though compressed. The final crossing crystallizes her earned patience with visible cost—she stands last, alone, watching the lake crack.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s investigative composure and hidden grief slot together believably; the micro-choice to pocket the lantern shard crystallizes his arc and motive.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt and need to “turn apology into action” are concrete and embodied in the handing-over of the box; the micro-choice to ask Thorne to “tell me about him” exposes fresh risk. Interiority stays specific to a chaplain’s register (“unspoken apology,” “hurried prayers”) and avoids label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—he never wavers or faces a live fork—so the arc is emotional accumulation rather than earned turn; cost is asserted, not paid on page. Thorne’s backstory is implied, not activated as pressure, keeping relationship crucible latent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is vivid and embodied, but the interior contradiction between her irreverence and yearning is asserted more than dramatized; the final activation feels inevitable yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to find deleted truths is crisp and consistent, but the interior contradiction between her role as “memory keeper” and her active deception never quite surfaces under pressure, flattening her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—pacemaker duty vs. personal pull to the shard—shows in micro-choice (mirrors before orchard). Embodied grief in the shard-warming beat gives cost, but men’s pain is mirrored, not crucible-tested; she never risks status or safety, so the “anomaly” stays asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory pull—between seeking death’s whisper and choosing to guide strangers to safety—grounds her interiority; the parasol-tip anchor is tactile and specific. Her “loose grip on reality” is shown through sensory slippage, not label. Final renunciation (turning from the marina) costs her the quest that once defined her, earned via Kai’s recording and the storm’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s guarded solitude and tactile attachment to the vineyard read convincingly; the burned-letter memory and bench-side micro-gesture (“traced the singed border”) externalize regret without label-speak. Contradictory impulses (stay rooted / wonder what escaped the fire) surface early but stay verbal; no embodied in-scene clash pushes her to a visible, high-stakes fork. Liam functions more as echo than crucible—his presence never pressures her status or future, so the relationship axis is flat. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the choice to remain sentinel is asserted, not dramatized with fresh cost; thus motivation rises to very good, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elar’s “strangely honest” trait is embodied in the exposed eye and refusal to grandstand; interiority stays concrete (“admitting the fear that the echo might slip away”). Motivation is steady—anchor the wisdom—yet the beat structure is one long circling ritual rather than a rising choice sequence, so the final consecration feels predetermined, not hard-won. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; he simply succeeds. Still, the sensory-bodied attention and occupational nuance lift him well above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “fingers steady as the lavender’s quiet bloom” shows calm under pressure—but her contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the final act of gathering photos feels inevitable rather than wrestled with. The cost is present yet soft, more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and weathered innocence are embodied in tactile gestures and whispered testifying; the crystal’s sonic mirror forces a final, costly renunciation of linear certainty. Interior contradiction—yearning for fixed meaning while witnessing its erosion—drives every micro-choice. The earned stance (language survives in pauses, not pages) is paid for by decades of solitude made palpable. No secondary characters dilute the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s brittle memory and tactile obsession stay embodied—trembling hands, chalk smudge, cassette pressed to rust—so the interior contradiction feels lived-in. The final recording moment crystallizes a credible renunciation: he trades future forgetting for one preserved hum, cost shown in the softening of “longing ebbed slightly.” Flaw: the precognitive flashes are announced more than dramatized, so the scalar drop toward 9-band is self-inflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's luminous ache and sage intuition give steady interior tension, but the emotional arc stays more observational than active; choices feel guided by fate rather than his flaws driving irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s decisive kindness and clear goal to craft a flawless goodbye materially shape every beat: her choice to invoke the vinyl shard and guide the duet is a micro-turn that forecloses Elena’s isolation. Interiority stays concrete, devoid of therapy-speak, and her endurance carries visible emotional cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s obsession with shadows-at-noon is lucid and her tactile rune-work shows micro-choices, yet interiority drifts into generic “cosmos secrets” shorthand; the final Earned Stasis feels credible but the emotional cost is asserted (“island hum aligned”) rather than embodied—still, she’s individualised enough to lift the piece above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is character-rich and exact (“mistakes into constellations”), but some shepherd-backstory lapses into summary rather than shaping urgent choices. Her forgiving-skeptic stance crystallizes believably when she clicks the tooth to the fountain, yet a few beats read slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting sky yet bound to stone—remains embodied; the glass-polishing micro-choices trace a credible shift from isolation to luminous service. Backstory intrusions (fire, mother) are anchored to present tactile cues and tilt her stance each time. The final “bridge for others” renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits her private grotto sanctuary. Yet the villagers remain faceless, so status crucible and voice distinction bullets are dormant; the score tops at low-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “watchful dreamer” label is asserted rather than dramatized; her proactive choice to offer the pendant is earned, yet Kai remains a cipher, muting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—completion vs. unraveling—remains vivid throughout. The shell fragment and cameos externalize his psyche without slipping into label-speak. Yet the climactic “vow” is more ritual declaration than embodied cost; the page never shows him sacrificing an actual alternative path. Still, his micro-choices (whispering incantations, pressing shell into spine) keep motive legible and tied to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elowen’s whimsical-mystic tinkerer trait stays consistent; her interiority is concrete (“fingers dancing like fireflies”) and links to embodied action. The micro-choice to pluck the tendril on the loom crystallizes her hierarchy of values, and the cost—exposure as the village oddity risking failure—is felt. Yet the absence of a second on-page character keeps status/relationship crucible dormant, capping the arc short of deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief is embodied and concrete; her stooped vigil and frost-numbed fingers externalize the interior wound. The micro-choice to pour starlight “heartbeat by heartbeat” onto the copper plate crystallizes her hierarchy of values—daughter-loss over self-preservation—yet the text stops short of dramatizing a contradictory impulse mid-ritual, so interior conflict is present but not simultaneous. Motivation is steady and escalating, and the final endurance (she rises with the map inside her) carries visible cost. Still, the absence of any live opposition or second voice keeps the relational crucible dark, capping her complexity just beneath the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reflective locksmith nature is sharply particularized through tactile micro-choices—angling mirrors, filing gears—so interiority never drifts into label-speak. The arc from fleeing war-loss to bottling wonder is credibly powered by his trait of “peripheral focus,” which both enables the breakthrough and costs him solitude; the final Earned Stasis (“the harvest was his own reflection”) shows that cost on the page. One slip: the silhouettes that “urge him onward” are never tested or refused, so that pressure reads external rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s fractal-curse/quest dynamic grants her interiority with recursive scars and embodied motion; choices calcify burdens to stakes, though reverie sometimes flattens micro-choices. Interior contradiction—love of infinity vs need to end it—grounds her. Closure renunciation (bearing all weights) feels earned, emotional cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cling vs. release—are dramatized in her literal grip on the carving blank; the sculpture project she chooses is a credible, visible cost that forecloses wallowing forever. Interiority stays concrete (“the hollow in her chest”) and circus-bred specificity grounds her perceptions. She is the only on-page character, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; her arc meets the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the carousel while scavenging its ruins—are embodied in her calloused grip and damp pockets. The ghost’s accusation crystallizes her internal split, and her final bargain shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her “stoic wonder” is more asserted than dramatized; the sextant fragment nudges her curiosity yet never forces a hard choice with visible cost, so the arc feels gentle rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet endurance crystallizes in the final kneel—an earned stasis that feels inevitable—yet his interiority leans on poetic abstracts rather than concrete embodied stakes, nudging the score down from mastery range.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “serene upheaval” and tactile salvage work reveal contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of conquest for understanding is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts choices.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “callused fingers” and “tears mingling with snowmelt” anchor his patience and reverence. The contradiction between his quiet compulsion to preserve and the risk of loss is dramatized in the moment he presses glass to rope. The final renunciation—accepting the weavers’ gift at personal cost—earns its resonance. Minor slip: “infinitely patient” edges toward label-speak once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his tactile handling of the thread, the “ink-stained journals,” the quiet resolve to stay—yet the story never dramatizes a moment where his flaw or misbelief collides with irreversible cost. The final renunciation (choosing the garden over the ship) is felt, but the causality is more lyrical than character-driven; we see the choice, not the internal contradiction that makes it inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elarion’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “callused hands,” “matted hair,” and “quaking reverie” anchor us in his obsessive stance. The contradiction between his yearning for organic beauty and his mechanical surroundings is dramatized through micro-choices (selecting, aligning, cradling the egg). The final vow to nurture the fragile yolk crystallizes a cost: he must guard it inside a hostile, quivering palace. One hairline slip: the phrase “hypothesized about everything” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting the embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—proving scars can sing—drives every tactile choice; the coin-thread ritual embodies filial guilt turned healer’s vow. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the “black sand in the union” instantiates her creed under pressure. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when she slices bark with firefighting blade—compassion outranks vengeance. No contradictory impulse on-page; final stance costs her the coin’s old luck, a felt forfeiture that closes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is well-inscribed: interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and micro-choices under pressure. She acts, regrets, and reorients; growth is late but earned via the stained-glass box closure. No significant lapses—competence balanced with struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elowen’s interior contradiction—yearning to break the cycle yet cradling its emblem—remains vivid; the gear’s warming against her palm bodies the conflict. Micro-choice to enter the nexus is causally tied to lineage memory and pings of foreseen descendants. Cost is legible: she settles among kin knowing the sigh persists. The slight drop from 9-band: we never feel her flaw produce an on-page mistake that compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his chisel pausing, the ribbon unrolling, the stone yielding under pressure—yet the “fiercely meditative” trait is more asserted than dramatized in contradictory action. The final renunciation of solitary grief for collective inscription is earned, but the spectral mentor’s dialogue edges toward thematic exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s guilt-anchored interiority is visceral; the trembling hand, the remembered hush before the swing, the etched rake-splinters all embody cowardice under pressure. The contradiction between public custodian of order and private breaker of it powers every beat. Only the brother-ghost’s silent nod feels slightly convenient, blunting the cost curve at the exact hinge where a harder refusal might have hurt more.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias feels specific and internally consistent, but his decisions never tighten stakes; everything happens to him. What pushes the mystery forward—picking up the case—reads as arbitrary cheer, not compelled choice. A passive protagonist keeps this below strong-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her “groundedly imaginative” trait shows in the iterative modeling beats—but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page; the quill hovers but never commits, so the required earned change/renunciation is only declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s copyist precision and solitude are concrete, but his pivot from passive transcription to clandestine dust-animator is asserted more than dramatized; the broadcast supplies motive, yet the interior contradiction between obedience and rebellion is summarized rather than felt in a single micro-choice. Cost is present—the risk of censorship—but it never narrows his options on the page. Interiority stays vivid (“ink-stained fingers,” “ember light flickering”), avoiding label-speak, yet the emotional inflection arrives pre-cooked. Enough specificity to reach the 7-band, but the decisive beat lacks embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is embodied in charcoal-stained fingers and the ache of withheld grief; her contradictory impulses—preserve vs. obliterate—collide in the act of grinding her mother’s outline into dust. The final choice to leave the mask on the stilled chair is earned by prior ritual and carries visible cost: the emotion is fixed only by relinquishing it. No headcount or dialogue issues; single POV holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “rational rebellion burned cold and clear” anchors the voice—but the internal contradiction between hoarding and sharing the cog is more summarized than dramatized in scene, muting the cost of his final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his war-torn past and present mission braid cleanly—but the three students remain sketches; their voices merge rather than clash, muting the crucible effect. The earned stasis lands, yet the cost feels generalized rather than individually lacerating.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s memory-tasting gift is embodied through sap on his lips; contradictory impulses (reclaim vs. forget) act in-scene. The pruning micro-choice visibly costs him old bitterness and seeds new resolve. Final smile carries earned cost: he forfeits anonymity to draw others into the greenhouse. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s compulsion to speak truth is stated more than dramatized; the only on-page cost is the involuntary info-dump about the bees, which Lira immediately absorbs without friction. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“preserve wonder amid the grind”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice shows him weighing disclosure against personal risk; the matchbox riddle is offered as flourish, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's quiet vigilance is concrete—his fingers brushing the orris shard, the scrape of chair legs—but the "inadvertently profound" label is unearned self-diagnosis rather than dramatized contradiction. Interiority stays selective and embodied; still, the final stance crystallizes more by authorial assertion than by a last micro-choice that costs him something we can see withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s synthetic nature and fear of emotional void are embodied in her trembling hands and recoiling thoughts; the telepathic exchange with Lirien forces a visible shift from certainty to nuanced acceptance, earning the closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every beat—his dice ritual, the chalked equations, the final reach into the rupture—yet the interior contradiction between hope and regret is more asserted than dramatized in scene. The chipped die as scar of past failure is vivid, but the “balancedly daring” trait is stated more than tested in micro-choices. Closure is earned: he pays with eternal ascent for one touch of the missed texture. Still, a hairline slip in embodied contradiction keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s insomnia and benevolent drive stay consistent; the brush-triggered visions dramatize his values. Yet interior contradiction is told (“his heart quickened”) rather than embodied in micro-choice, and no external character pressures him, so the arc is solitary and static. The final renunciation of sleeplessness feels foreshadowed but not costly because no live alternative is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s conservationist drive is lucid from first line to final gesture; her split-second, self-sabotaging use of the opera lens crystallizes both flaw and cost on the page. Interiority stays concrete—spectacles adjusted, palms slick with meltwater—avoiding stock dread labels. The only drag is a brief explanatory phrase (“a dying art she was desperate to rescue”) that names what action already proves.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession to reverse fate is vivid and embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing grooves backward, spinning the orb). Interior contradiction—“victory and doom”—threads every beat, and the final trembling hands give felt cost. Slight over-articulation of motive in the closing paragraph keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid (“repulsive allure,” “velvet over thorns”) and the buried guilt over the sister is concrete motivation, but the confession beat is rushed—no embodied contradiction in the moment, just spoken declaration—so the change feels announced rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward’s vow and tactile use of the mallet give him clear, escalating motive; interiority stays embodied in salt and wood. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The earned crescendo—storm transmuted into orchard’s music—shows credible endurance with visible cost in vibrating fruit and spent energy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile mapping and the final whistle act; her grief and resolve crystallize when she learns Thorne is now a watcher. Interiority stays concrete, though “sunwashed dread” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is precise—his “emotional rationality” is dramatized in the moment he tempers the surge of hope with logic—but the trait never complicates or costs him on the page; it remains a stable lens rather than a flaw that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s “stoically sensitive” duality is embodied in the mortar work and ink ritual; the inkwell beats give concrete micro-choices that charge his final stance. Motivation stays anchored to the single dominant stake—excavating abandoned dreams—and the notes he embeds foreclose his old surveyor neutrality with visible cost. Interiority is specific to his profession (“every contour of the eroding coastline”) and avoids label-speak. Flaw is quiet but present: his empathy could drown him, yet the page lets that risk stay suspended rather than paid, so the change feels partial.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is consistently concrete—her fingers tracing the stamp’s brass ridges embodies the archive-bred hunger for truth. The contradiction between inherited duty and the emergent “deliberate submersion” thesis is held in-scene, not alternated in summary. Final decision to re-index the world costs her the safety of accepted history; cost is legible when she pockets the stamp and feels the library’s tilt realign her stance. Single-POV focus keeps hierarchy of values tight; no label-speak under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief’s pull toward oblivion versus the artisan’s drive to shape light—are enacted in every micro-choice: selecting the amethyst, recalling Lira’s laughter, folding grief into paper. The final release of cranes carries visible cost: his shadow stays gone, the island keeps spiraling, loss is not erased but externalized. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; pain is rendered as thorns hidden in silk, a tactile, embodied image that reappears in the basilica’s jasmine-thick air. 9+ test met: contradiction in scene, renunciation earned, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven quest is visceral and embodied; the geode crystal anchors his contradictory impulses. His final choice—to weaponize the discovered satellite—emerges credibly from prior causality and carries visible cost (he seals the airlock, stepping into the void). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The only minor slip is a touch of explanatory phrasing near the end (“bleak, exhilarating, eternal”).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority is sensorily rich (“perpetually surprised eyes” reflecting cosmos), but trait never complicates choice; drone insertion and lever pull are competent, not costly. No interior contradiction under pressure; closure brings wonder, not renunciation or new risk. Missing embodiment of surprise as obstacle or micro-choice keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in trembling hands and the “sieged hush” ritual; the contradiction between forging histories and hoarding one truth is dramatized. The vow to speak at the end is earned via the watch-hand epiphany and costs him the safety of silence. Interiority occasionally drifts into stock phrases (“guilt gnawed,” “relentless tide”) but the hierarchy of values—Eliza > self-image—remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—his wish to atone versus the reflex to control—surfaces only late and is less embodied than summarized; Tomas receives the token in silent beat, so relationship change is declared rather than dramatized. Still, Elias’s earlier miscalculation and the palpable weight of the brass pull give his final gesture credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his half-laugh/half-sigh, salt-in-wound regret—but the “merrily melancholic” label is asserted more than embodied; the final embrace feels earned yet slightly under-cooked because Lena’s presence is off-page until the last beat, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—cynical grifter vs. reluctant empath—surface in concrete micro-choices (newspaper decoding, right-hand path). Interiority is specific, but the “jaded wonder” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s grief and longing are palpable, but her interiority leans on lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction; the transformation beat shows resolve yet lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to cartomantic control while craving absolution—remains embodied in ink-stained fingers and trembling breath; the tracing ritual turns memory into a micro-choice that visibly costs her composure. The daughter’s absent handprint still governs the final beat, so the maternal stake feels causal, not ornamental. Flaw: “willingly perplexed” is announced more than dramatized until late; a single earlier beat of her refusing clarity would have locked 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s pacifism and inherited trauma are vivid, but interiority slips into therapeutic paraphrase (“clinging to a code of non-harm that defined his every circuit”). The micro-choice to scan the tears is present, yet the gravitationally-lighter trait is announced rather than embodied under pressure; still, the final buoyant rise gives a credible costed shift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-abnegation vs. the need to witness transformation—surface in the moment he pockets the jars, then again when he releases them. The embodied cost (empty pockets, ragged coat) is visible and consistent. Final renunciation of material security for communal prophecy lands with felt price. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s calm-inventive trait is dramatized through tactile lock-work and the sundial cipher, giving us embodied competence under pressure. The interior contradiction—guardian duty vs. insurgent intent—drives every beat; her micro-choice to twist the quill holder clicks a visible cost. Yet the supporting cast arrives as clean archetypes (sentinel, cook, archivist) who echo her purpose without pressing back; no status friction or personal stake sharpens her risk. Still, the earned ignition of sparks on palms crystallizes a charged poise that forecloses retreat, satisfying the closure cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s precognition and mentor-promise motive are vivid, embodied, and escalate to the final step into aurora; the eel-herding persona is distinctive, though secondary characters remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his pacing, the “hum of ancient telescopes,” the act of rarefying memories—yet the story withholds any contradictory impulse that would complicate his final resolve; the cost is felt but not dramatized in a second, clashing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's metallic limb and duel-scarred history are embodied through decisive micro-choices—tilting the needle card, tracing sundial angles, lunging at shadows—that reveal both wound and wit; his diplomatic ferocity shifts from suspicion to alliance in one credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s “molting” is announced but never complicates a single on-page choice; the coffee-tin reveal is neat yet lacks prior behavioral seeds. Marcus fares better—his binding talent surfaces in action and the dream speech shows stakes. Relationship arc is legible (quiet alliance → shared risk) but status/power shifts stay off-stage; final “hope” is asserted, not embodied. No interior contradiction is dramatized, so the promised personality cycle feels decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s longing is embodied in the aching fingers and the cracked clock; his strategic creativity is dramatized when he repurposes the reel and clock into a projector-piano. The final chord is a credible renunciation that costs him the frozen past and re-opens the future. Interiority stays specific and avoids label-speak. One character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is lucid from the first paragraph and stays tethered to the seed; her interior contradictions—“luminous doubt” vs. resolve—are shown through bodily gesture and dream logic rather than label-speak. Yet the dream-ancestors do the interpretive labor for her; the final ritual choice is less a crucible moment than a relay of instructions she passively transmits, so the cost feels distributed across the group rather than personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s grief-rooted need to “name the hue” of apology is steady and embodied; the compass-lace test forces a visible micro-choice. His interior contradiction—pride vs. regret—shows in the remembered harsh critique and the salt-water ritual, so change is motivated. The pine-sprig graft into the lace makes the cost tactile, fulfilling the Earned Stasis. Still, the apprentice remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in her shift from "needless drama" to humility, embodied through dust-stained fingers and trembling notebook. Micro-choices like capturing butterflies to "gently brush wings" reveal her reconfigured values with visible cost in the final equations.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "artist to fugitive" shift; embodied "hands trembling" avoids therapy-speak. "Purpose in pauses" phrasing risks abstraction but earns resonance through concrete frost-retracing. Final choice forecloses isolation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority shows embodied trauma (sweat, vibration felt in bones) and contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve), but capsize memory lacks visceral sensory flashbacks to deepen internal conflict beyond label-like "unspoken terror."

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (solitude vs. duty) drive pivotal blood ritual and lingering cost; embodied weariness fuels agency. Slight abstraction in "unspoken pleas" prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation (intergenerational legacy) drives every choice; her embodied restraint—pulling the girl into the arbor while murmuring warnings—reveals contradictory impulses: protect youth yet empower them. Flaw: "heart swelling with motivation" edges toward label-speak without deeper physiological contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong embodied emotion in healing sequence, but "spiritually curious soul" labels weaken interiority; micro-choices like breath-syncing reveal values, though old man lacks depth beyond plot function.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("itch to impose order" vs. "mind quivered in reverie") grounds motivation in embodied emotion; final disintegration choice earns transformation through prior causality. Micro-choices under retrocognitive pressure (pressing shard to arch) reveal value hierarchy with cost ("forever changed"). Lacks secondary pressure but single-POV execution compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction lacks active tension; "patiently strategic" trait informs decoding but isn't tested under stress. Final planting choice earns closure with visible cost, yet emotional complexity remains underdeveloped beyond stated motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong interiority via synesthetic perception ("blues sighing like ocean swells"), but final resilience realization lacks contradictory impulses in the climax beat; micro-choices under pressure remain abstract despite embodied scars.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction strong (thief vs guardian) but "luminous disbelief" edges toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; final choice earned by prior decoding of floral code.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines when Elias's theatrical narration ("primordial fire") masks despair, but "thoughtfully spirited" trait occasionally veers into authorial voice (e.g., "weighty lightness" feels imposed rather than embodied). Micro-choice with father's bookmark—tracing fissures while recalling debate—perfectly crystallizes motivation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's embodied phobias ("claustrophobia that clawed") and adaptive dexterity during decryption create visceral contradiction; Marcus remains thin as a villain despite functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority vividly embodied ("bare feet crunching shards") but lacks contradictory impulses; obsession drives action yet no visible struggle or tradeoffs weaken earned change. Flaws don't complicate choices—she succeeds unimpeded despite booklet fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (machine logic vs. mystical curiosity) drives choices, but "thoughts came from everywhere" edges toward abstraction; micro-choices like delicate violin handling ground motivation despite minor thematic echo in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias's internal contradiction (registrar logging others' truths while hiding his own) manifests concretely through the lens's warmth and hesitant doodle strokes; the final choice to draw his vulnerability feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in "weight of his guarded heart thawing."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    No contradictory impulses evident; Elias's steadfast pragmatism lacks internal conflict despite high stakes. His "wisely pragmatic" trait drives actions but remains unchallenged until the climax, missing micro-choices that reveal value hierarchies under pressure. The polished marble ritual shows embodied belief but no genuine struggle against his own flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation for sideways time is clear and embodied in action (breath fogging viewport, lever pull), but lacks contradictory impulses; Jax's "obliging" trait isn't tested under pressure, reducing earned change. Emotional progression remains overly rational without layered irrationality during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lacks contradictory impulses; Elias's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear but unconflicted, with no visible internal struggle during the pivotal disruption. Embodied emotion is strong (trembling fingers, water seeping trousers), yet the resolution lacks a credible endurance cost beyond conceptual weight. Micro-choices like tracing symbols with his bow reveal values, but the final shift from mystery to resolution feels unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (isolation vs. necessary departure) manifest concretely through tactile choices—touching the smudged illustration, stepping to the fogged window—with embodied cost in the "auroral sorrow" that "washed over her." Mira's fault-tolerant method avoids oracle clichés by showing pressure-altering mechanics in action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias's skepticism versus emerging belief, embodied through valve wheel handling and parallel guilt. Final realization earns closure via prior causality, but "drowsy alertness" repetition slightly dilutes embodied specificity during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation ("witness change without judgment") is clear but remains abstract; embodied contradiction appears only late as "body aching but mind alight," failing to manifest earlier under pressure like library decay.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority shines in embodied grief (crushing sage leaf, harmonica guidance) but "soft as her laugh" veers into label-speak. Final choice lacks contradictory impulses; Theo's shift feels earned through tactile details like the curl's transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet static with no earned change or visible cost during discovery. Sensitively perceptive trait shown via actions but no struggle or tradeoffs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias' interiority feels authentic with embodied contradictions (e.g., "tremor of excitement" vs. "hands steady"), but Maris lacks depth beyond functional plot device. Motivation ("transpose life") integrates cleanly with micro-choices like sealing the microdot cookie, though the "symphony of hidden purpose" metaphor edges toward abstraction without sufficient concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interiority leans abstract ("muffled clarity," "hidden assumptions") with diagnostic phrasing that risks Q1 penalties; embodied emotion surfaces in sweat-beaded brow and sandal's click but contradictions lack simultaneous tension during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via "chronologically homesick" embodied through memory mapping micro-choices, not labels. Final conductor transformation earned by shell etching sequence with visible cost ("exhaustion's tide rising").

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines in "doubts and alternate lives coiled like serpents" and shadow-self confrontation; embodied emotion avoids labels. Minor abstraction in "conquer the labyrinth" phrasing slightly softens final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (numbness vs. seeking spark) embodied through callused hands tracing hides and vibration-focused choices; final change earned by backward song's tactile assault on emotional frost without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority grounded in storm-recording habits ("boots whispering against mossy tiles"), but "credibly curious" phrasing edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses lack simultaneous action in pivotal moments; follower threat remains abstract without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority masterfully embodied through sensory triggers; "trembling fingers" uncorking vial shows contradictory impulses (caution vs. need to understand). Elara flashback integrates flawlessly with present action, avoiding therapy-speak. Slight abstraction in motivation ("gnawing motivation") prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in "trade scars for stardust / cling to the fray" but "poet's soul igniting" veers into label-speak; embodied emotion falters at climax where "heart quickened with subtle passion" lacks concrete physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lacks internal conflict; motivation is clear but not tested through contradictory impulses. Backstory told not shown, and secondary characters serve as passive audience without altering Elias's state.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction in "affectionate detachment" is clear but lacks visceral embodiment during transformation; "widower's grief subsumed her detachment" risks abstraction without physicalizing the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction (shrewdness vs whimsy) drives micro-choices like envelope retrieval, but emotional progression feels tidy; Mira's reaction lacks layered conflict when locket reveals her lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's "bold sympathy" manifests concretely in proposing the search and insisting on the crater descent, with her marsh-reed craft directly enabling the resolution. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs. belonging) act simultaneously in her hesitation at the arbor and final integration, earning the closure through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "heart raced" is label-only feeling during critical borrowing moment. Embodied emotion present elsewhere but pivotal choice lacks simultaneous conflicting drives required for 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elowen’s grief-as-equation struggle, but single-character limits relationship crucible; "ambiguous loss" drives embodied micro-choices (aligning glass eyes) with visible cost in the final lightening of heart.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines via Elias's methodical invisibility versus yearning to be seen, embodied in his tentative emergence and caching ritual. Flaw visibility lacks sharper tradeoffs in the final scene where risk feels underweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (control vs surrender) manifests physically in transformation; micro-choices like pressing the leaf earn the hybrid resolution with felt cost in "fingers elongating into tendrils." Avoids diagnostic label-speak through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias's solitude-seeking yet connection-craving; micro-choices like tracing rain trails reveal hierarchy of values. Mira's thinness slightly weakens relationship crucible despite efficient introduction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "panic surged" relies on label over embodied struggle. Motivation for touching pearl feels under-conflicted despite strong setup. No visible trade-off between magic amplification and self-preservation during critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("emotionally rational" yet feeling pull of lies) drives micro-choices like folding the letter carefully; embodied emotion via chest ache and petal symbolism avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of solace for truth earns cost through grandmother’s uncles, though emotional progression slightly abstracts in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "stoic facade cracked inwardly" during inkwell discovery; embodied micro-choice to embed notes reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. Motivation slightly abstract but anchored by tactile repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority grounded in archival work, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension; "tranquilly perceptive" label repeats without embodied tradeoffs during critical stamp discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines: grief clawing "like thorns hidden in silk" while folding paper birds embodies simultaneous hope/despair.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority leans on physics jargon as emotional buffer; "bleak exhilaration" label lacks embodied contradiction. Final choice earns cost through prior causality but micro-choices under pressure feel sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s simultaneous urge to protect and confess, embodied through physical tremors and the watch hand micro-choice; however, Eliza’s absence flattens relationship stakes despite credible guilt-driven motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction evident in Elias’s hesitation at midpoint, but Tomas lacks depth; "uncommonly thoughtful" trait drives micro-choice to verify brother’s release, though brother’s redemption feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Contradictory impulses ("jaded by world's indifference yet wondering at fragile beauty") embodied through micro-choices like selecting the right labyrinth path to confront crimes. Final empathy kindling earned by visceral victim visions and baseball's warmth, though "kindle empathy" phrasing edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior contradiction in destitution vs. generosity is concrete, but motivation ("texture of transformation") remains abstractly told without sufficient embodied conflict during key choices; micro-choices (detour, releasing bugs) reveal values yet lack deeper friction between want/fear.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lacks contradictory impulses during crisis; Elara’s flawless calm under pressure flattens interiority despite strong embodied choices like tracing wards. No visible struggle between vigilance and revolutionary risk.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation (unravel sacred patterns to end precognition's torment) is rooted in consistent traits; her contradictory impulses (hollowing visions vs. ritual focus) manifest concretely during rock placement. Final choice to step into aurora earns closure through prior causality, though the curse's flaw doesn't actively complicate mid-ritual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong motivation ("protect cultural memory") but interiority leans abstract; "luminous doubt" repeats as label without sufficient embodied contradiction during ritual climax. Micro-choices align with goals yet lack visceral stakes in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s pruning vs unspoken regrets, but Mira’s absence limits relationship crucible; the pine-weaving closure earns endurance with palpable cost ("wound reopening like a poorly healed branch").
