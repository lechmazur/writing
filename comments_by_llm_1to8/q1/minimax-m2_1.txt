    Mira's interiority is vivid and embodied—"feeling the residual warmth," "loosening of the grief that had calcified"—but her arc relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from survival to pursuit is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The glass-artist backstory provides rich texture but occupies substantial real estate without altering present tactics until the final turn. Internal conflict remains largely retrospective; no genuine mistake or live tradeoff emerges to test her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is grounded in sensory method (heat-mapping) and embodied through careful movement, but her arc toward "understanding" arrives via epiphany rather than a choice under contradictory pressure. The tuning fork case is handled repeatedly, yet remains symbolic rather than forcing a trade-off. The final paragraph's claim that she "had succeeded" and "had become the translator they needed" reads as self-awarded rather than earned through an on-page renunciation or decision with visible cost. No secondary character is present to apply relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's weariness and professional dedication are embodied through his stubborn adherence to old mortuary methods and the "persistent ache behind his ribs." His choice to engage with the souls shows motivated action, and the revitalization he feels ("The ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade") demonstrates earned change. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—his shift from tired to "ready" lacks intermediate micro-choices that would ground the internal contradiction more deeply. The final stance crystallizes cleanly but the path there could show more struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her leadership style ("gently persistent") is embodied through concrete actions—midnight deliveries, whispered requests handled quietly. However, the interiority remains somewhat abstract; we see her観察 and actions but lack visceral internal contradiction or embodied emotional cost in peak moments. The final choice to ring the bell feels somewhat declarative rather than earned through prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses. The lack of on-page resistance or friction within Mira herself flattens what could be a richer arc.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mei's interior experience is richly rendered through embodied perception (grief leaving "a signature of salt on her tongue"), and her spiritual vocation shapes how she sees. However, her agency is mostly receptive—she is guided by warming artifacts and breathing changes rather than making difficult choices under contradictory impulses. The final act of photographing the tendrils feels like following a predetermined script rather than a decision that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost. Label-speak moments ("spiritually curious by nature") and the therapeutic framing of "healing" slightly flatten what could be sharper characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is specific and her actions are motivated by her grandfather's legacy, but the piece leans heavily on abstract conceptualization ("arguments about how human consciousness might move through time") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "design a maze that could trap...the texture of time itself" is declared more than earned through on-page struggle. Her embodied experience of tracing spirals and holding the fragment grounds early beats, but the climactic moment lacks visceral cost—she begins to draw without visible friction or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear—preservation against erasure—but her interior life remains largely abstract. The chains-as-disguise detail and patient vault-walking convey strategic competence, yet we see no micro-choices under immediate pressure, no embodied contradictions that would reveal her as an individual. The final-paragraph "keeper of futures" declaration edges toward label-speak rather than dramatized cost. Interiority stays thematically consistent but lacks the particularized texture that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's synesthesia and her drive to capture trust's dissolution are established with specificity, and her embodied perception ("red sounded like tearing paper") grounds interiority. However, the final "breakthrough" reads as a quiet settling rather than a choice under pressure; she realizes the sound architecture but makes no on-page decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. David's memory loss provides backstory weight, yet the piece never dramatizes a present conflict between contradictory impulses—Elara observes and understands rather than acts against competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira remains entirely internal and observational throughout; the man with camellias never becomes a live participant, reducing him to a prop. Her "art of the golden-hour theft" and "jar of captured moonbeams" are presented as established competencies without on-page struggle or cost. The ending gesture—her smile of "quietly savvy knowledge"—asserts completion without dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path or alters her stance. Interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("moments chose their observers," "destiny's door") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glassblower's interiority is vivid and particular—his relationship to glass craft and internal glaciers is embodied through handling the bookmark and shaping the vessel. The motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains abstract and told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. No secondary character pressures choices, and the protagonist's reflection dominates without on-page micro-choices that alter present options. The final act of placing the bookmark beside the cooled glass reads as a symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's phobia is named but never constrains a live choice—she "listened to stars humming," spiraled into the library, then stood and declared herself transformed without on-page struggle against enclosure. Internal contradiction is asserted ("fear and power could coexist") rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses in scene. Daniel's shift from mentor to captor is summarized in a single expository block ("he had known the truth all along") instead of revealed through action. The final declaration "I am not who you made me" feels unearned because no micro-choice under pressure tested her resolve or foreclosed a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The oracle's motivation is clearly established—drawing a map of endless night—but her interior life defaults to summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final peace "her mildly obsessed heart... finally found peace" reads as label-only emotional closure without embodied cost. Micro-choices are absent; she executes her task without visible friction or trade-off. The grandmother's teaching and pebble-shore backstory occupy substantial space but never tilt a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit 7-Kappa's interiority shows consistent robot-POV filtering and the recursive awareness loop creates genuine internal contradiction. The shift from maintenance routines to questioning consciousness reads as earned through the Procedure's effects. However, the final "acceptance of flow" moment leans toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction acting in the peak beat, and the robot's emotional language ("curiosity," "feeling") occasionally slips into unearned human affect without sufficient mechanical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied—the lens-polishing habit, the hand contact surprise, the weight shift of the lens at closure. Internal contradiction appears in the ambiguous clarity stance: believing presence means something while words fail, wanting transparency through obscurity. However, Mira remains largely opaque; her arrival and departure feel more symbolic than character-driven, and her motivations are told rather than tested on the page. The final micro-choice to begin drawing arrives but feels predetermined rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's character is consistently rendered through tactile detail (sap stains, cloth molded to palm), but her choices lack meaningful stakes. The mended deception backstory arrives pre-resolved, removing agency from the present frame. The protagonist's endurance and ritual are embodied, yet the final moment offers contemplation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; she operates from settled wisdom rather than live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a genuine trade-off. Her actions proceed smoothly from hypothesis to confirmation without internal conflict or embodied cost—she simply pulls the lever and succeeds. The "mechanically warm" trait appears twice as a label without constraining a choice or creating friction. Interiority remains abstract ("beautiful, impossible multiplicity") rather than rooted in specific contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to decode Marco's message is established early and drives her to the piano. Her interiority leans toward abstract reflection ("liminal hollow," "bridge between worlds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to stay and play reads as inevitable discovery rather than a choice with visible competing costs—she understands what to do and does it without meaningful internal friction. The final departure feels like ceremonial closure rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly embodied—her guilt over Elena's death manifests in physical sensations (copper taste, fever's aftermath) and contradictory impulses (wanting to touch the smudge but never doing so until the pivotal moment). The choice to touch the illustration and then issue the warning feels earned by her three-day fever-dream of processing Elena's face and the "word she could never quite hear." Minor slip: "fault tolerance as an oracle" reads slightly expository for peak interiority, though it's quickly grounded in dream imagery. The final shift from terror to lightness tracks causally through the smudge-touch revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is established early—he seeks to unload a swallowed truth—but his interior remains abstract and distanced. The "religiously skeptical nature" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final confession is gestured at ("something he had never spoken aloud") but never embodied or specified, leaving the change asserted rather than earned with visible cost. Reflection is heavy but anchored; the interiority tilts present choices minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper is characterized entirely through abstract attributes ("patience," "reverence," "loose grip") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. No on-page micro-choices under pressure demonstrate hierarchy of values; the piece narrates philosophical stances rather than dramatizing them. Interior experience reads as timeless meditation, never degrading under stress or confronting a trade-off with visible cost. The final paragraph's "loosening" is asserted rather than earned through causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and her role as therapist shapes her approach, but her interiority relies heavily on therapeutic abstraction ("linking," "nurturing wonder") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The touch from Maya offers a moment of connection, but Elara's response feels observational rather than conflicted—she witnesses rather than struggles. Her decision-making remains comfortably within her professional role without a meaningful internal cost or trade-off that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to collect stories is clear and his "sensitively perceptive" trait is embodied through his careful handling of ash-fragile pages, but his choices remain largely observational rather than conflicted. The realization about Miriam's theory and the warming tapestry suggest interior shift, yet no action or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal—he moves from collection to comprehension without genuine struggle between competing impulses. The final decision to "probe deeper" restates his initial purpose rather than transforming it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is established through concrete action (folding fortune cookie wrappers with the same precision as microdot specs) and his interiority shows a consistent perceptual filter rooted in his espionage past. The interior contradiction between orchestration and trust in flow provides depth, and his relationship to his past drives choices throughout. However, the final moment—standing at the window while the woman and fisherman arrive—lacks a decisive on-page choice with visible cost; he observes rather than acts, and the alignment between writing "Some journeys end where they began" and the convergence feels more thematic echo than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Father Matthias's interior world is vividly rendered through his scholarly preparation and ritual precision, with embodied choices (adjusting the loop pedal, examining the palette). His motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions feels authentic and shapes his investigative stance. However, Gabriel exists only as an off-stage scream; the possession's collaborative architecture remains abstract rather than dramatized through concrete contradiction or micro-choice. The final walk toward the vestry reads as setup rather than closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elira's motivation—writing fortunes from unlived memories—is established but remains abstract throughout. The protagonist performs tasks (tracing the shell, mapping memories, writing the fortune) without visible internal conflict or embodied stakes that force difficult micro-choices. The condition "chronologically homesick" is labeled via clinical language ("temporal displacement syndrome") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt cost; she completes the assigned prophecy without struggle or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her "gravity-defying mind" and relationship to the tablet remain static attributes rather than sources of internal conflict—she floats, observes, and accepts rather than struggles with contradictory impulses. The childhood memory fracture is summary-only ("a wanting that had grown into the gravity-defying curse") without embodied emotion or a micro-choice that alters present stance. The final paragraph asserts control and readiness ("she would be the one who had dropped it") but no prior scene dramatizes the shift from fragmentation to agency.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interior journey from numbness to receptivity is clearly embodied through physical response to vibration. The transformation follows a credible arc grounded in sensory specificity: her palm against wood, vibrations traveling up her arm. Minor weakness: the final paragraph's forward-looking summary ("would become") tells rather than dramatizes the cost of her choice. Koren remains functional but flat, serving primarily as guide without internal contradiction or pressure of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to document truth is established early and drives her final choice to send evidence, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The transition from observer to actor is structurally present but lacks embodied contradiction—she moves too smoothly from fear to resolve without genuine internal friction. The "credibly curious mind" functions as a label rather than a dramatized trait that creates costly mistakes or hesitation. Marques exists only as exposition delivery; the followers are atmospheric pressure without physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is dense and embodied through her rope-tracing ritual, but her central choice never fully crystallizes into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she circles the threshold without dramatizing the tension between documenting transformation and joining it. The "ethically playful" attribute remains label-only; no on-page action tests boundaries with visible cost. The final decision to "remain on the threshold" reads as a refusal to choose rather than an earned renunciation that forecloses a path, muting the cost required at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and specific—"chronic hush," "echo-harbor violinist," the mendicant's bowl as inheritance all ground her. Her motivation to "unbind something" is embodied through the violin and carried by her grandmother's storytelling tradition. The final choice to carry the bowl forward feels earned by the accumulated grief and stubborn beauty. Minor: the internal contradiction could be sharper; her grief is asserted more than it conflicts with her resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is densely rendered with concrete physical anchors (static electricity, paper texture) and her micro-choices show professional methodology translating to personal risk. The grief moment embodies contradiction—she maintains "affectionate detachment" even as sorrow "rearranges the furniture of her interior world"—yet the final surrender ("she already knew what she would do next") reverts to comfortable professional stance without visible cost that forecloses a path. The transformation feels observed rather than suffered; no prior option is closed by her epiphany about "whole lies," only suspended, which reads as Earned Stasis but the price remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's cargo-broker shrewdness and attentiveness are well-established through concrete details (tide-reading, freight calculations, noticing silent bells). Her decision to pursue the letter is motivated by her grandmother's voice and professional instinct, though the stakes of this choice remain primarily internal and contemplative. The encounter with Elias yields emotional resonance but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses create visible struggle—she moves smoothly from discovery to connection without meaningful hesitation or cost. Elias is convincingly rendered through his wariness and the accumulated detail of his copyist career, but he functions more as a mirror than as a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Yara's interior contradiction is legible: she craves connection but her sympathetic nature previously drained her, creating a lived tension between wanting to give and needing to receive. The arbor scene embodies this paradox through concrete image—she sees her younger self offering endless help without asking for reciprocity. The shift from performative giving to "ask[ing] what shapes they needed from her hands" demonstrates character-particular growth with visible cost (abandoning her familiar martyrdom). Motivation is consistently rooted in her fear of dissolving into others' grief, but the final choice feels slightly summarized rather than dramatized in a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's profession filters perception aptly (moth species, documenting vanishing creatures), and her choice to journey toward the echo chamber under pressure is motivated. However, the climactic action—pressing the pendant and "borrowing" fragments—relies on abstract mechanics explained rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. The final choice feels declarative ("She understood now what she must do") rather than earned through on-page conflict between fear and resolve. Interiority remains generic in key beats: "troubled her deeply" and "sudden clarity" are stock phrases that flatten what should be a charged decision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conjurer's interior is established through metaphor-heavy reflection on ambiguous loss, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to leave the glass eyes feels more like acceptance of a poetic idea than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a live path. The motivation remains abstract—"mathematics of emotion"—without embodied stakes that alter tactics under pressure. Interiority leans toward philosophical summary rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's methodical kindness reads as consistent essence, but interiority relies heavily on abstract assertion ("the only form of love she has ever known") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The character lacks genuine internal conflict—her discovery proceeds smoothly without competing impulses or visible mistakes. The final "smile in the sapphire dark" and fulfillment claim feel unearned; no on-page micro-choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Her competence is never balanced by struggle that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (the grant letter settling "like a stone," hands shaking in mornings). Internal contradiction operates well: decades of studied detachment clash with her terror of uprooting. The phone call to Sarah demonstrates a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses evasion with visible cost. Minor slip: the caterpillar metaphor in the final beat edges toward over-articulation, though it remains grounded in shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's physical state (nineteen days of insomnia, trembling hands, seeing double) is embodied effectively, and her interior logic—trading a valuable brooch for a telescope—aligns with the post-war value shift. However, her motivation remains abstract ("thresh meaning from experience") and the final decision to "let go" feels declared rather than earned through visible on-page cost or contradiction. The stranger is functional but passive, applying no pressure that forces Mira to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Varen's arc from prideful certainty to humility is traced through concrete moments—gathering warm cave pearls that show him nothing, experiencing the "first crack in his certainty." The nine-day learning process feels compressed but the shift from "a man who believed the future was a country he had already visited" to one who has "seen the limits of seeing" carries embodied progression. Interior contradiction operates in the pearls scene when his vision fails. The ending renunciation forecloses his old relationship to clairvoyance with felt cost, though the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany-assertion rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation to compile fragments is consistent and his visionary ability is well-embodied through the visions triggered by touch. However, his interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted—he processes meaning but faces no genuine internal resistance or contradictory impulse that would complicate his choices. The final understanding of the valve's purpose arrives as epiphany rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Sera functions primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aria is present and her route-mapper identity is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on paraphrase and label-speak ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic mind"). The climactic reveal—"I never told him I was afraid to lose him"—arrives through reflection rather than embodied conflict, reducing emotional cost. The mentor relationship is told rather than dramatized, so the final confession lacks grounding in on-page pressure. Micro-choices that would demonstrate her values under stress are absent; she follows arrows without meaningful internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's skepticism is established early and her shift feels earned through concrete experience with the tile, but the transformation lacks sufficient internal friction—she moves from doubt to wonder too smoothly. The interiority is generally concrete ("something shifted in her chest—a loosening of doubt") though occasionally drifts toward stock phrasing. Her final stance preserves skepticism while adding wonder, which reads as credible endurance rather than collapse, but the micro-choices leading there need sharper contradiction to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's immortal weariness is established, but his motivation remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The "waiting for the right moment" for three millennia lacks concrete embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal character under pressure. Interior language drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the vast and terrifying absence that every mortal feared") that reads more like narration than a mind in the moment. The final "understanding" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior is specific and grounded in concrete choices (death certificates, precision work), and her father's legacy creates authentic internal friction. The decision to help Darius feels somewhat abrupt—her analytical process is summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Darius remains functional but flat, present primarily to receive Elena's help rather than applying pressure that forces her internal contradictions into collision. The ending renunciation ("how to give fairly") lands with conceptual weight but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—her belief that silence carries memory, her methodical charting—but she remains oddly static across the entire piece. No internal contradiction pressures her choices; she simply continues the work she's done for seven years without friction, renunciation, or cost. The "earnest studious pursuit" is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or doubt that would make her final gesture feel like a choice rather than continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nameless protagonist remains consistent in their observational stance, but the piece withholds agency until the very end. Interior life is filtered through heavy abstraction ("the nameless one understood then") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to continue collecting is thematically coherent but feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's professional identity as myth-buster is clearly established, and her progression from debunker to reluctant embracer shows some internal contradiction. However, the final transformation feels explained rather than embodied—"she felt something gentler" tells the shift without showing the micro-choices under competing impulses. The turn toward acceptance arrives through extended reflection rather than a dramatized moment where her skepticism and longing genuinely collide on the page. Interiority leans toward summary and thematic announcement in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's role as "culture shock absorber" is stated but her internal contradiction between preserving community and accepting inevitability shows some depth. The foundation stone chip is handled physically and emotionally, grounding her purpose. However, her competence is never tested by genuine failure—she paints symbols with assured purpose but faces no on-page cost that would deepen characterization. The grandmother's teaching and Mira's fluency in the cipher feel convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and professionally obsessive, with clear embodied choices (setting equipment methodically, checking the camera twice). The grain of sand and Yusuf's mentorship provide character history that tilts present stakes. However, the final beat lacks contradictory impulses—she simply executes her plan without genuine internal friction or a choice that forecloses a meaningful alternative path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions more as a symbolic figure than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. His interior is told through general emotional labels ("heartfelt," "quiet satisfaction") rather than embodied contradiction. The blindness attribute is well-handled as a different kind of perception, but the repair itself proceeds without meaningful internal friction or cost—he moves with "practiced efficiency" to a foregone conclusion. No genuine struggle or foreclosed path appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is specific and character-particular—her atlas-editor's lens shapes what she notices. The choice to pursue the convergence is established rather than dramatized under pressure; the story tracks observation and interpretation more than decisional turning points. Embodied emotion appears in "the particular silence of a discovery about to be made," but most beats describe reading and inference rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful cost forecloses a path on the page; the ending remains anticipatory.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliorn is characterized through her patience and specialized knowledge, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"learned patience that transcended mortal waiting" tells rather than shows contradiction. The motivation is clear (restore the town's resonance), yet no meaningful internal conflict emerges; she walks with unwavering conviction across the entire arc. The piece offers embodied detail (fork pressed to sternum, warm from use) but lacks micro-choices under pressure that would reveal competing impulses or a hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's descent past survival instinct and her final transformation are motivated, but the shift from drowning panic to transcendent acceptance lacks embodied struggle—the "no drowning" moment arrives as assertion rather than earned through micro-choices. Internal contradiction is present (survival vs. task completion) but flattens once the perfume activates; the protagonist becomes a passive vessel for memories rather than wrestling with the cost. The grandmother's legacy provides clear motivation, yet Marina's individual stakes dissolve into collective essence without visible friction at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus carries interior contradiction—grief and purpose intertwined—but his motivation to "thread a labyrinth with his own story" remains largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose paths. The final act of speaking his father's words aloud reads as symbolic closure, yet the embodied cost is abstract; we see no visible trade-off or struggle in the moment itself. Interiority leans toward elevated philosophical phrasing ("membrane between what was and what might have been") that distances us from immediate sensory experience. The character arc traces a clear before/after, but the escalation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's core motivation (debt repayment through loving service) is consistent, and her final choice to pass the work to the gardener shows coherent progression. Interior life relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses under pressure—she drifts, manifests, presses the bead, but we don't see her weighing competing desires in the moment. The gardener's sudden inheritance of "loving venom" and unexplained tears feel asserted rather than earned through prior characterization. Embodied emotion is present but leans decorative (ashen veil, translucent fingers) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's motivation (to transform ruin into reverence through sewing paths) is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract throughout. The piece tells us she experiences "haunting optimism" and "orchid solace" without dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sew the spring's rim feels inevitable given her established pattern but lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing want resisted. Interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("haunting optimism," "orchid solace") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is densely rendered with concrete anchors (grandmother's tears at apple blooms, the birthmark matching the gnomon), and her decisions to remain and excavate show agency under pressure. However, the emotional progression from "warmly curious" through "cautious enchantment" to the final homecoming reads somewhat smooth and uncontradicted; the piece would benefit from a moment where her scholarly detachment conflicts viscerally with personal grief. The final paragraph's "cautious enchantment of a homecoming that was also a departure, a death that was also a kind of rebirth" tilts toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is established through her action of crafting pseudonyms and her attention to margins, but the interiority remains abstract—"wondered which child would see them" tells rather than shows micro-choice under pressure. Eleanor exists only as reported request; no on-page relationship creates crucible. The postscript addition reads as a micro-choice, but the cost of this particular letter remains asserted rather than felt through embodied emotion or contradiction. The final stance (gathering clipboard, stepping out) lacks visible foreclosure or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing ("whispered secrets," "let them think her foolish") and label-only wisdom rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices—threading filament, pressing palm against fabric—feel observational rather than high-stakes micro-decisions with visible cost. The "disguises wisdom as foolishness" attribute remains a told trait without on-page friction where it forecloses a path. Emotional embodiment is thin; most affect is asserted ("allowed herself a small smile") rather than dramatized through perception or gesture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her interiority shows contradictory impulses—the desire to heal versus self-punishment, the impulse to run versus the need to face her past. The gargoyle shard as a witness and the handling of it across beats embodies her emotional state effectively. The final renunciation (she doesn't go back in time, but finds internal permission to stop punishing herself) is earned by the swamp's pressure and carries visible cost in the years of grief. Minor deduction: the sister remains somewhat abstract; we see Maren's guilt more vividly than the relationship itself.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is specific and embodied—the anesthetic softening, the translator's instinct to witness—but the pivotal "grafting" moment lacks visible cost or contradiction. Her choice to decode the cast is unobstructed; no competing impulse or foreclosed path appears on the page. The phrase "shrewdly innocent" is labeled but never dramatized through an on-page tradeoff. Fatima's touch and the grandmother's relief are concrete, but Elira's arc feels more observational than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied—the hollow efficiency and shaking hands ground her need—and the final uncurling is earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction appears in the laugh with its "pensive edge," acknowledging joy's fragility. The old women and children serve as witnesses rather than full secondary characters, keeping focus tight. Minor slip: "whatever impulse made forgotten things reach out to be remembered" drifts into abstract commentary where concrete agency would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interior life relies heavily on abstract epiphany ("the first stirring of something she could not name," "bewitch through a method she could not explain") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The seventeen-year backstory and restoration expertise are told rather than dramatized through on-page choice. The final stance—"completing a conversation"—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causal decisions that narrow options. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's scholarly rogue persona is asserted through labels ("charming rogue scholar," "particular warmth of a woman who knew secrets worth dying for") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her planting action proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal conflict or trade-offs that would reveal character through friction. The backstory about "seventeen closed libraries and three interrogation rooms" is summarized exposition rather than lived experience shaping present choices. Elder Okonkwo exists primarily to deliver world-building rather than to create relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interior state is vividly rendered through concrete metaphors (greenhouse of the spirit, photosynthesizing pain) and her continuous action of writing. However, the piece lacks on-page contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure—she simply continues doing what she has done for years/centuries. The longing is embodied through the galaxy postcard and her accelerating writing, but no micro-choice alters her stance or reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The characterization is poetic and coherent but static, operating more as portrait than dramatic agent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caretaker is defined entirely by her role—"glass-orchid caretaker," "keeper of vanished things"—with label-only interiority ("foxglove regret," "gently systematic grace") that never contradicts or complicates her stance. No micro-choices under pressure appear; she moves through rounds "with reverence" in a static loop. The work is preservation without friction, cost, or competing impulse. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible price emerges by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and drives her final action, but interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("symphonies of truth," "unsnarling meaning") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The trembling hands and hesitation gesture toward internal conflict, but the prose often tells us she "understood" rather than dramatizing competing impulses in real time. Elian's arrival and tears feel somewhat convenient; his three-year silence and sudden reappearance lack on-page friction or cost that would make the reconciliation earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivations are coherent—tracing her father through chemistry, inheriting his work—but internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from grief to resolve without visible struggle between competing impulses. The "dappled resolve" phrase at closure attempts to signal ambiguity, but on-page micro-choices never dramatize a hard trade-off or foreclosed path with felt cost. Interiority leans abstract ("love could be encoded in the smallest physical decisions") rather than embodied perception under stress. The final choice to continue his work feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible wrestle between preservation and control.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's interior world is detailed and her grief-driven motivations are consistent, but the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to "remain open to messages" feels more stated than earned through a visible on-page struggle that forecloses another path. Backstory dominates (~40% of the text) and although it anchors to the present meteorite work, micro-choices that alter present options are sparse. The phrase "recalibration of a heart" and similar abstractions drift toward therapy-speak without embodied cost in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("necessary distances," "sacred thresholds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The character's epiphany at the terrace—that drift patterns follow flight paths—arrives through observation and pattern-reading rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The mother remains off-page throughout, reducing relational crucible to symbol. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing ("featherly determined") that labels rather than dramatizes trait-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's interiority is consistently filtered through his inherited quest and the feather's significance, showing embodied engagement with the facility. However, his change at the end—understanding that belonging is "a breath to be shared"—arrives as an epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother's backstory and researcher notes provide texture but the protagonist's own stakes remain abstract; he never faces a concrete trade-off or renunciation on the page. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves through discovery to realization without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority shows some concrete embodiment ("breathed deeply, letting her senses expand outward") and her professional skill is established early. However, the fisher's emotional state relies on stock phrasing ("eyes carried the particular emptiness") and his transformation at the end—tears falling freely—lacks the contradictory impulses that would earn higher scores. The decision to offer consolation rather than certainty feels gesture-appropriate but not deeply conflicted; no visible cost constrains her professional choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's interiority is concrete and his philosophy of "probability made palatable" feels character-specific. However, the piece leans heavily into contemplative summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure—he performs, but his decisions never face genuine internal contradiction or a moment where competing impulses force a visible cost. The reflective mode dominates without enough present-frame friction to earn the final "analyst's smile" as genuine change or renunciation. Embodied emotion and stakes-driven agency remain largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tide dancer remains passive throughout—her choices are already made before the story begins, and the cosmic verse writes itself without dramatized struggle. Interiority is heavily filtered through figurative language ("salt of her former world would evaporate into memory") rather than embodied emotion. The final smile and insight feel unearned by on-page contradiction or cost; she walks away lighter, but we never see her genuinely struggle with exile's weight in the present scene. The human woman is a prop, not a character applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glazier's interiority is consistently reflective and voice-specific, filtering perception through her professional lens. However, the piece lacks embodied emotion under pressure; the protagonist observes patterns without facing contradictory impulses or making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final turn toward her workshop feels like resumption rather than transformation. Motivation remains abstract—"illuminate value in the mundane"—without a concrete stake tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied in places—the weight of the box, the tracing of scars—but her interior journey toward "translating pain into something others could carry" arrives too cleanly without ambivalence or competing impulses. The final paragraphs lean on abstract self-awareness ("the hard softness she had learned to inhabit," "letting the slow dance of stars witness her quiet vigil") that reads as diagnosis rather than lived contradiction. Emotional progression toward earned wisdom feels assured rather than wrestling with doubt, capping the score before the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is described exclusively through abstract labels—"logical dreamer," "meticulous precision," "imaginative spirit"—without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her interiority consists of philosophical assertions about hope's methodology rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. No micro-choices with visible cost appear; she continues her research in a flatline of serene confidence without struggle, blind spots, or genuine stakes. The piece reads as a character sketch rather than a person facing contradictory demands.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior world is richly textured through her perceptual signature—she reads walls and traces emotional residue—but her agency remains largely observational until the final paragraph. The climactic decision to "sketch what she heard" arrives quickly after discovering Ashworth's partial chart, without visible on-page conflict or cost that forecloses a competing path. Embodiment is strong (breath clouding, boots finding worn stones), yet the stakes feel inherited rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria's motivation is consistent—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—but her interiority remains decorative rather than conflicted. The borrowed heartbeat is mentioned repeatedly without creating internal friction or forcing difficult choices. Her "perceptively calm" attribute functions as a label throughout; no moment dramatizes a cost of that calm or tests it under genuine pressure. The piece gives us graceful action but no embodied struggle, no trade-off that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clearly rooted in her brother's death and twenty years of persistence, but her interior life remains largely summary-driven rather than embodied contradiction in the present scene. The shift from "peace would honor him" to "peace saves the living" is told as completed wisdom rather than dramatized through on-page struggle. Lord Varen and Duchess Sera show embodied grief through trembling hands and softening eyes, but their arcs compress too quickly from vengeance/loss to handshake without intermediate friction. The final "redemption" feels abstract—a thematic claim rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly established through backstory—the memory of the dying bird—but her choices on the page remain limited to following a pre-determined plan (walking, kneeling, placing the egg). Interior life leans heavily on summary ("She had given up everything") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "amoral philanthropist" framing is told rather than tested through on-page choices with visible trade-offs. The final act of walking away without looking back reads as a prepared ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courtesan's interior world is richly rendered with embodied resistance ("her wrists turned in ways that meant 'I refuse'"), but her agency remains observational rather than decisional through most of the piece. The work of untangling threads is described in metaphorical abstraction without concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The defiance claimed in the final paragraph feels asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost—she was always awake, so what path was foreclosed? Interiority leans heavily on elevated, poetic register that occasionally distances rather than grounds emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and his contradiction between colonial mapping instinct and ethical restraint reads credibly. The epiphany about "stories we refuse to complete" feels earned by the reverse-telling experiment. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("half-lit epiphanies," "territorial conquest") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. Mira exists only as summarized accusation; her absence weakens the relational crucible that would sharpen Elias's cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her hands-on work, but her actions remain largely unopposed and internally frictionless. The "esoteric realist's mind" label appears three times without dramatizing what that stance costs her or how it conflicts with other impulses. The final choice to rebuild tomorrow reads as philosophical acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The monarch's descent feels more like witness than agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara's interiority is concrete and particular—guilt as "a stone in her chest," forgiveness "forged" through hammering at locked doors. Her technical gentleness constrains her night-long work and the final choice to return to the world she fled is earned by five winters of isolation. Minor slip: the epiphany structure ("After forgiving yourself, the world looks different") edges toward therapy-speak, though the subsequent imagery grounds it. Internal conflict between guilt and duty operates clearly, and the protagonist's arc integrates with her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Foresight remains largely interior and passive; her motivations are told through backstory rather than tested by scene choices. The "transcended" ending bypasses embodied cost—no micro-choices under pressure show what she risks or renounces. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("emotional cartography") and the grandmother's directive functions as exposition rather than lived contradiction. The final beat asserts transformation without dramatizing the internal conflict that would make it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maruk's frugality and scholarly nature are established early, but his interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory under pressure. The discovery sequence shows methodical dedication but lacks embodied emotional conflict—his "trembling hands" at the climax arrives without prior physical manifestation of doubt or fear. The final choice to renew the covenant feels inevitable from his character but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply continues his post with a secret, which reads more as Earned Stasis than a decision that alters his stance with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's pacifist stance is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she simply refuses violence without internal friction. The cellular-memory mechanism arrives as exposition rather than emerging through embodied choice. Kael's resentment is told ("calcified his heart") rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final release feels asserted by authorial fiat rather than earned through prior dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is distinct and embodied through her sensory relationship to materials ("breath and the glass becoming a single system"), with her mirror-making philosophy showing consistent character logic. The work suffers from a lack of internal contradiction or competing impulses; her certainty about boundaries and thresholds remains untroubled throughout, reducing tension. The woman who brings the sextant exists only as a delivery mechanism, applying no meaningful interpersonal pressure. Mira's final realization involves no visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply waits and sees the mountains, making the character arc feel more like skilled execution than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation (repairing the statue, seeking reconciliation with her daughter) is clear and embodied through concrete action—grinding, fitting shards, tying the ribbon. The interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden and unearned") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (offering the ribbon, crossing to her daughter) is earned by prior action, but the epiphany feels declared rather than discovered through pressure. The daughter's arrival reads as coincidental rather than causally linked to Mira's work, weakening the agency test at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is dense and specific, with concrete details like the orchard's humming fruit and the bathroom's sealed door grounding her emotional state. However, her bewilderment is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves from confusion to understanding in the final paragraph without visible internal conflict forcing micro-choices. The inheritance backstory occupies substantial space but tilts present stance only weakly; the grandmother's voice and the cameo warm her palm, yet no on-page decision alters tactics before the final realization. The ending's shift from "bewildered" to "understanding" feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to rescue knowledge is stated but her micro-choices under pressure remain abstract—she "traces fingers along spines," "realizes," and "understands" without embodied contradiction or visible cost in the moment. Interior life consists largely of reception and translation rather than competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "rescue mission" realization arrives as epiphany rather than earned through dramatized friction. No secondary character appears on the page to test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is established through concrete backstory (chimera twin consciousness, brother's death, her search), but her choices on the page are largely observational. The "curse of blissful aberration" is named rather than dramatically embodied in contradictory impulses during the present action. The final step forward into fog reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority leans toward lyric summary rather than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's methodical nature is embodied through her actions (examining the seal, tracing the rope braids), and her decision to reconfigure the rope flows from established traits. However, the interior life remains surface-level—her "particular excitement" and the moment she "understood" feel asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final smile caps the arc cleanly but without visible tension or cost that would elevate the characterization into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied ("ripple-mark skin tingled with borrowed energy"), and her mapkeeper training shapes her perception consistently. The choice to use the echo chamber stone and produce the tone feels earned by her professional skill set, though the emotional progression toward "hammered repose" arrives quickly without sustained internal contradiction. Minor issue: the moment of inviting the bloom reads slightly more procedural than conflicted, dampening the felt cost of her isolation before finding refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is rich with sensory detail and her retrocognitive trait is signaled, but her motivation to "prove that coincidences have meaning" remains abstract and unearned by concrete choice under pressure. The custodianship role generates atmospheric detail but no visible internal conflict or competing desire that would create genuine tension. Her decision to climb at midnight feels predetermined rather than fought-for, and the eleven-year endurance lacks dramatized cost or renunciation on the page. The blessing functions as a label more than a constraint that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait is asserted through exposition ("This was not weakness but method") but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions—moving among monuments, examining shadows, writing—trace a meditative observation loop without genuine internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path. The final shift ("her own identity shifting, becoming less a thing she carried") reads as conceptual summary rather than earned change rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her chanting ritual, the tactile handling of tools, and the embodied knowledge from her grandmother ground her motivation. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary about her "serious playfulness" and "fire's true purpose" rather than letting those contradictions act simultaneously in scene. The final lighting choice is earnest and legible, but the opposition is atmospheric (starless sky, quiet villages) rather than forcing a genuine internal conflict or micro-choice trade-off. Minor penalty for over-articulated philosophy ("controlled combustion was possible") that occasionally drifts toward label-speak instead of embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is character-particular and embodied ("pressed the jade cicada to her lips, tasting its mineral coolness"), with micro-choices that reflect her chronicler's sensibility. The sister remains present but passive, providing pressure without agency; status dynamics exist but don't evolve. The closure choice (placing the cicada between them) feels somewhat abstract—a gesture rather than a decision with immediate foreclosed cost. Internal contradiction is present (the desire to document vs. the difficulty of being present in pain) but underplayed in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to escape the bunker is clear, but her interior life leans heavily on abstraction ("intangibly tangible," "flavors of different silences") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to return to the bunker with a new understanding reads as resolved epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path—she will build "something different" someday, but no present stake is surrendered. Emotional progression is summarized ("she understood now") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation to comfort through silence is established and her micro-choices (extending route, uncorking vial, humming) are clear, but her interior remains somewhat external and competent without genuine struggle or contradiction. The boy functions as an object of care rather than a source of dynamic pressure; his nightmare state shifts too smoothly under Maren's intervention without resistance. The "fluidly logical" trait is label-only; we never see it constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Emotional progression is linear and the final move (humming at exact frequency) reads as skill demonstration rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared via backstory and told through forty years of study, but her on-page choices are procedural rather than conflicted—she decodes, follows instructions, presses her palm. The ruby flake responds to environment rather than her internal struggle. No embodied emotion or contradictory impulses complicate the ascension; the character reads as a successful scholar executing a plan rather than a person forced to choose under pressure. The final "custodian" realization arrives as epiphany without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is legible—isolation as suffocation—and the final choice to step through the threshold with the doorknocker ring is clear. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("love could suffocate," "isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation") rather than embodied contradiction. The shadows as "memories made visible" remain ornamental; they watch but do not pressure choices. The arc from severing to reopening is present but the micro-choices that earn the turn are thin on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's trajectory from pyramid-scheme survivor to quantum-promise witness is motivated, but the transformation at the mushroom farm feels under-earned—her shift from total distrust to tears of belief lacks sufficient on-page friction. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is asserted but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Interior voice is distinct (the coffee-can detail, the mark's-eye view), yet the final epiphany arrives without dramatized resistance, lowering the cost legibility of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured through embodied perception ("the creak of rusted hinges sounded like a greeting from a dying world"), and her contradictory relationship to inheritance drives the narrative. However, the ending truncates before we see her emotional response to the revelation, leaving the final choice or stance invisible. The grandmother's voice and the "truth" arrive but Elara's agency in response never materializes on the page, weakening the arc's closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's interiority relies heavily on abstract therapy-speak ("withdrawn knight," "memory might finally quiet its relentless accusations") rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation to manipulate the marionettes emerges late and feels more thematic than grounded in character-specific needs. The final transformation ("he does not feel alone") reads as declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that trade one path for another. No secondary character appears to test his stance under relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is specific and embodied through her archival practice, but she remains largely observational rather than decisional—the story delivers extended reflection on her broken-heartedness and philosophy without a present choice that costs her something on the page. The button discovery prompts contemplation rather than a dilemma that narrows options. Internal contradiction is present (wanting to honor grief while maintaining distance as "not the person who decided"), but it never crystallizes into a micro-choice under pressure. The final act of documentation feels like continuation rather than transformation or renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear and consistent—preserving truth against regime erasure—but her interior life remains largely functional rather than contradictory or deeply embodied. The eleven-year span of invisible resistance is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her grandmother's legacy provides backstory anchoring, but Mira's own emotional texture stays relatively flat; we get competence and determination without the messy simultaneity of fear, doubt, or competing impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band. The final choice to descend feels inevitable given her role, but lacks visible cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The saxophonist's motivation is clear and his duty is embodied through the ritual act of playing, but internal contradiction is minimal—he executes a practiced task without meaningful temptation or conflict pulling him in another direction. The moment when "a phrase broke through" and he answers with three sharp notes shows competence under pressure, but no visible cost or mistake that compounds. Interiority leans toward atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a person struggling with competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Seraphina's interiority relies heavily on abstract spiritual language ("tingle at the base of her skull," "mossy delight") rather than embodied contradiction. The forty-season backstory and grandmother's moonstone establish motive, but the protagonist never faces a choice with visible cost—she simply descends, retrieves the seed, and "emerges transformed" by declaration. The phrase "she always emerged transformed always" is a tell, not a dramatized struggle. No conflicting impulses act in scene; the discovery unfolds without friction or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and consistently rendered—her refusal to accept bureaucratic closure and her methodical yet accepting stance are established early. Interiority remains concrete ("broken-clock tinkerer" who finds "peace in gears") and embodied through her careful movement through debris. The character lacks sufficient on-page pressure to force contradictory impulses into simultaneous action; she moves through the scene without meaningful internal conflict or a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final descent feels like continuation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's grief-driven motivation is clear and her decision to restore the coin using kintsugi is character-specific, but the interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("the weight of names pressed upon her") rather than embodied contradiction. The brother exists only in memory and summary, which limits relational friction. The final realization "she had come to redeem her brother's work...but instead she had redeemed herself" feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional terrain, approaching diagnostic clarity rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, but her choices feel preordained rather than pressured. The soldier's shift from shame to laughter is told through summary ("the beginning of a smile") rather than dramatized with embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is claimed ("the familiar ache in her chest") but never shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "adjust the harp's misaligned bridge and begin to play again" is continuation, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's proprioceptive enhancement provides concrete embodiment throughout ("every joint slightly displaced from where memory insisted it should be"), and the shame of compliance during interrogation registers viscerally in her stomach. Her micro-choices—walking forward despite the beacon's call, refusing to remove the strap—demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to remain at the clearing's edge facing an unknown cost forecloses the path of comfortable numbness with visible psychological stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—"reader of the in-between" feels earned through seventeen years of carrying the fragment. The motivation to honor overlooked histories drives present choices, though the final acceptance feels slightly rushed. Internal contradiction is present (thought she was honoring vs. being prepared to become), but the grandmother's deathbed scene and the alchemist encounter could show more embodied tension. The shift from keeper-of-memory to continuation-of-work lands with conceptual weight but minimal visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's gift is established through concrete, embodied perception (dust patterns, temperature drop, peripheral vision work) rather than label-only exposition. His choice to climb toward the hatch demonstrates agency under pressure, though the "weightless burden" framing occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction. The internal contradiction between professional assessment and supernatural sensitivity creates authentic tension. Minor slip: "the echoes never guided him falsely" tells rather than showing earned trust through prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is dense with world-specific perception ("reading the frost," recognizing "compressed histories"), but her motivation remains abstract—she follows patterns without dramatized internal resistance or competing impulses. The final choice to "open, not hold" the whisper arrives as epiphany rather than friction-laden decision; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Her embodied reactions are sparse: "ink-stained fingers" and "felt the familiar resistance" do not ground emotional stakes under pressure. The piece leans on atmospheric detail in place of contradictory desires that would elevate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vespera's interior life is rendered with specificity—her "poet's heart" understanding storms, the vase shard teaching her to carry fragments without being cut. Her evolution from revolutionary to curator is embodied through concrete choices (covering mirrors methodically, touching the shard's edge) rather than summarized. The final decision to cover the final mirror while holding space for multiplicity shows contradictory impulses crystallizing into stance. Minor deduction: the revolutionary backstory remains somewhat abstract; we see the failure's residue but not the specific wound that reshaped her.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cassian's interiority is detailed and texture-rich, but his agency remains largely observational until the final connection. The work across forty years is told rather than dramatized through a meaningful choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; he expresses doubt about midnight's nature but never acts against the covenant's demands. Embodied emotion appears sporadically—"feeling the vibration travel up his arms"—yet much of the passage substitutes metaphoric abstractions ("weight of every note") for concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly embodied through her perceptual signature—petrichor collection, psychometry—and the piece shows micro-choices (uncorking vials, touching the compass, descending) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation ("she would not return") carries visible cost tied to her entire professional identity. However, the decision feels somewhat foregone; internal contradiction could have been sharper—she never resists the pull, so the choice to stay reads inevitable rather than torn. No therapy-speak, strong sensory grounding throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aria's interiority is concrete and embodied—her reading of driftwood grain and the lantern slide's shifting images anchor her perceptual signature. The epiphany about "timewoven alliance" arrives with minimal on-page struggle; she understands in a single observational moment rather than through contradictory impulses acting under pressure. The final sculpture choice feels more thematic declaration than earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict remains largely reflective rather than dramatized through competing desires in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly textured through her sustained fascination with night-blooming flowers, and her discovery moment at the cathedral window feels earned by months of contemplation. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure—we're told she "worked with a persistence" and "spent months trying to understand" without witnessing concrete decisions that test her commitment or reveal contradictory impulses. The final epiphany ("not merely about flowers opening in darkness but about...profound patience") edges toward therapy-speak articulation that a character mid-crisis would not summon so tidily. The renunciation or cost remains implied rather than dramatized with a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Miriam's motivation to reach the lagoon is clear and her grief/wonder mixture is embodied, but her agency at closure is passive—she witnesses her grandmother's apparition and receives information rather than making a difficult choice. The grandmother's crystalline appearance and the "parley" feel externally delivered rather than earned through Miriam's struggle. Interior contradiction is minimal; she moves from desire to revelation without genuine conflict that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—he rejects comfort and wishes to rebuild through memory—but his interiority reads as exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice (walking into the new world) lacks visible cost or renunciation; he has already decided and the amber bottle simply executes the plan. Embodied emotion is largely absent; phrases like "rejected false comfort" and "teach them to live without magic" are assertions rather than dramatized struggle. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the conflict abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphine's interiority is densely layered—her professional identity and mystical receptivity interweave—but her agency reads mostly as passive reception rather than active choice under pressure. The grandmother's childhood voice and the ancient tablets provide atmospheric texture, yet Seraphine's final "understanding" arrives through immersion rather than a dramatized decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied contradiction is present (the "velvet disquiet"), but the peak beat describes insight more than it enacts a renunciation or transformation that narrows her path. The piece leans heavily on reflective immersion; while the BRR exception allows expanded reflection when interleaved with micro-choices, here the present-frame choices remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara possesses clear motivation (discovering borrowed time's texture) and her "furiously tranquil" nature is embodied in controlled movement through crisis. However, the piece lacks genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously—her paradox is asserted more than dramatized in conflicting micro-choices. The final "understanding" arrives as declarative epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost, and interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the texture of borrowed time was not borrowed at all but borrowed forward") that reads more like thematic summary than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven ("the moment just before, when everything aligned and she became part of a system larger than herself"), but her internal conflict remains largely reflective rather than dramatized in scene. The comparison to monks and the bell-rope moment approach contemplation without foregrounding contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her agency at closure—throwing the switch—is competent execution of her role rather than a choice that costs or transforms her, limiting the score despite clean embodiment and consistent motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    The cosmic janitor remains consistently observant but never makes a meaningful choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Interiority is entirely summary ("they believed," "they had learned," "they understood") without embodied contradiction or pressure-driven micro-decisions. The kneeling gesture and star-fragment collection feel ceremonial rather than dilemma-driven; no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. Label-only emotions ("empathy," "vulnerability," "strength") replace embodied experience throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is atmospheric but often abstract—"tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"—label-only traits that don't drive on-page choices under pressure. Her decision to dig and accept the covenant feels more like fulfilling a prompt than a motivated choice shaped by contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; the ghost interaction and final acceptance lack visceral friction or visible cost that would emerge from genuine internal conflict. The ending grants her a role without dramatizing what she sacrifices or refuses to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The timekeeper's interiority is consistently abstract and poetic but rarely embodied—she "thought about" things rather than experiencing visceral impulses. Her motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" remains declarative; no on-page micro-choice tests competing desires with visible cost. The final "understanding, settling into her chest" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through assertion rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's internal landscape operates through embodied perception—"warmly attentive" hands, the feather cradled "with a tenderness usually reserved for the nearly broken"—and the observation of the injured kingfisher creates a clear parallel that drives the tending action. However, the piece leans heavily on contemplative processing rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the poet's stance remains consistent and affirming throughout without genuine internal friction. The final choice to carry incompleteness feels thematically declared rather than earned through a visible micro-choice that forecloses another path. Micro-choices exist (gathering feather and kite, working while watched) but they don't reveal competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied choices under pressure (climbing the ladder despite weakness, wrapping wire as "language"). Her terminal diagnosis drives a renunciation—she doubles workload rather than retreating—with visible cost in physical weakness. However, the diagnosis functions more as backstory frame than ongoing pressure that forces contradictory impulses in scene; her calm acceptance flattens potential internal conflict. The final stance feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is stated clearly but her choices remain largely internal and reflective rather than pressured by competing impulses in scene. The "luminous skepticism" trait is label-heavy; the piece tells us she has "academic rebelliousness" and "skepticism" but rarely dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "transformation" is asserted through summary ("she was no longer the same being") rather than a visible forfeiture or renunciation with on-page cost. Embodied emotion is thin; much interiority reads as philosophical musing rather than character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman is rendered through vivid particulars—his "weathered hands," his fluency in bird calls and dead languages—but he remains more archetype than individual. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves through the piece with unwavering purpose and no visible struggle or doubt. The "fertilization spell" moment offers embodied ritual but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal competing impulses. The final smile reads as satisfaction rather than costly renunciation or transformation earned through prior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular—bloodhound sensory gifts, tactile cylinder reading—but the brother remains a voice-in-wax abstraction without contradiction or friction. The final "understanding" arrives as serene epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost attends the revelation. Embodied emotion is present in the leaf-handling and fingertip work, but the closure beat ("I knew with certainty") asserts resolution without dramatizing renunciation or stake-altering decision. Reflection dominates (~40% by line count) yet anchors concretely and interleaves with micro-choices (constructing the device, shifting methods), meeting the BRR expanded allowance; Q1 and Q5 remain uncapped.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior is dense with abstraction ("blessed pariah," "architect of temporal breakthrough") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "peace" moment arrives through summary rather than a micro-choice under pressure. Her motivation remains told ("confusion into exploration") without dramatized stakes that force competing impulses into collision. The glimpse of her father functions as memory rather than present decision friction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Caelius's motivation to amend the theft is established, but his interior life remains abstract—"the weight lifted from his shoulders" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Seraph's "sacredly playful wonder" is a label applied twice without dramatization; her reaction to the chess pieces ("This is impossible") does not reveal character-specific stakes or cost. The final choice feels unmotivated because we see no on-page struggle or trade-off; he simply kneels and hands over the pouch. No micro-choices under pressure differentiate him from a generic penitent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to archive small gestures is established, and her interiority shows embodied grief through the walking patterns and chessboard handling. However, the character reads more as a conceptual vehicle than a fully contradictory presence—her "benevolently ruthless efficiency" is stated but never generates an on-page dilemma where care conflicts with triage. The sister's absence drives the action, but Mira's choices feel pre-decided; she walks patterns and releases sound without internal friction or a moment where competing impulses force a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mercury-glass seer possesses a concrete physical form and her interior contradictions appear (fear versus gift, isolation versus connection), but her emotional progression feels abstract and label-driven. The pivotal moment—"I want to remember what home felt like before I learned to fear my own sight"—arrives as articulated insight rather than embodied struggle. Her decision to leave at the end reads as declared rather than earned through on-page choice under pressure. The keeper functions more as oracle than character, offering wisdom without his own stake.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority carries specificity—her chess-tutor lens filters perception, her fidgeting hands serve character and plot. The past failure (nobleman's son) is concrete enough to motivate present stakes. However, the final epiphany ("permission to winnow through the accusations") arrives quickly after she sits; the arc from exile to self-forgiveness compresses without visible internal contradiction or struggle in the present scene. Embodied emotion is present but the therapeutic framing ("permission," "forgive herself") edges toward label-speak at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's defiant artist identity is established through embodied action (writing on bone walls, kneeling with the child) and her motivations are clear. The internal contradiction between her past compliance and present resistance creates texture. However, the child's instant emotional connection ("That's about my mother") feels unearned, and Sera's shift from solitary rebel to surrounded teacher happens too smoothly without visible tactical adjustment or cost. The priests' arrival at the end lacks embodied reaction from Sera—no pulse quickening, no tactical recalibration—which flattens the stakes of her exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout—"uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic" reads as assertion rather than embodied struggle. The matching-wounds ritual provides concrete action, but motivation stays philosophical rather than grounded in contradictory wants under pressure. The final "smile, uncertain still" attempts to close the arc but lacks the micro-choices that would show competing impulses acting simultaneously. Embodiment is present in physical gestures (trembling hands, pressing the charm) but emotional stakes remain concept-driven rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's grief-driven withdrawal is embodied through his cave wandering, and his decision to place the shell in the pool marks a credible shift from grasping to releasing. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical musing ("the illusion of permanence revealing itself as the fragile construction") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandmother's shell provides motivation, but the epiphany feels more declared than earned through on-page struggle; "he felt the familiar itch in his fingers" reads as a reset rather than a costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority shows commitment and embodied tension ("pressed her palm," "remembered her grandmother's words"), and her choices drive the resolution. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between wanting recognition and needing to purify intention, though this could be sharper. The purification process feels somewhat abstract ("vibration that had no name") and the cost of her choice—renouncing ego—is more told than dramatically tested on the page. The grandmother's teaching and Thessaly's gift provide motivation, but the climactic moment leans toward epiphany without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior is grounded in concrete ritual (bronze censer foot, moon-phase clarity) and her micro-choices to answer midnight calls show agency under pressure. The woman at the marsh is given tears and a reverse-migration pull, but remains a figure to be guided rather than a second living consciousness with contradictory impulses. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure—Mara commits to repeated midnight navigation with visible cost (she will walk north into grief)—but the final encounter feels more like illustration than dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her rationale for seeking the cure is established through reflection, but the piece lacks genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "involuntary truthfulness" is asserted but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The reflective passages dominate without meaningful micro-choices that alter present options; her climb and study feel predetermined rather than forced by conflicting impulses. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs—she simply continues her established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aldric's gift of "borrowed memories" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure. The final revelation—mother's abandonment—arrives via exposition rather than forcing a live decision with visible cost. The stranger remains a cipher whose motivations are told rather than discovered through pressure-tested inference. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("witnessed isolation," "peculiar gift") without specific embodiment or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear—following her father's last wish—and her decision to step through the doorway feels earned by the accumulation of clues and the rising water. However, interiority often relies on abstraction ("the calm recognition," "empirically intuitive knowledge") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice lacks visible internal friction; she moves forward with certainty rather than conflicted impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which limits the emotional cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's interiority is consistently filtered through a specific perceptual lens (memories "weighted," warmth "drained"), and her micro-choices (pausing at the narrow passage, kneeling at the pool) show embodied emotion under pressure. However, the final "reborn with mystery solved and purpose reclaimed" reads as a label-only epiphany rather than a contradictory choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The twenty-three-year backstory establishes weariness but does not create an on-page dilemma where competing impulses act simultaneously at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("density of presence," "scientifically romantic investigation") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "realization" about depth of attention feels asserted rather than earned through prior on-page struggle with visible cost. Sera functions as a receptacle for Maren's insights rather than applying independent pressure. The protagonist's arc reads as lecture-mode self-discovery without genuine flaws complicating the choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is densely layered with contradictory impulses—jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia, jaded wonder—and these operate simultaneously rather than sequentially. Embodied emotion appears in "tears I didn't realize I was shedding" and the physical act of tracing epitaph letters, grounding abstract states. However, the piece leans heavily on label-speak ("lucid dreaming," "chronologist's disease," "feral nostalgia") that names states more than dramatizes them, and the final choice to "let the feral nostalgia take me" reads as acceptance without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied ("hands knew the language of essential oils"), and her arc from loss to adaptation shows genuine progression. The renunciation of scent as "the point" carries cost, though the final realization feels slightly over-articulated ("she understood now that the sensing had never been only about smell"). Mira's backstory as midwife adds depth but remains largely static; her choices don't pressure Elena on the page. The protagonist's internal conflict—mourning versus acceptance—could be more contradictory and simultaneous rather than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and her arc from intellectual rejection to intuitive acceptance is earned. The crystallizing trait is presented but functions primarily as metaphor rather than forcing embodied trade-offs under pressure. Internal contradiction exists (scholar's precision vs grandmother's intuition) but the final epiphany—"runes only answered those who could be honest with their wounds"—leans toward label-speak rather than dramatized discovery. The grandmother's influence shapes the choice but remains largely reflective rather than a live obstacle on this platform.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her apology speech carries embodied weight ("words felt like stones dropping into still water"), but her occupation as "gossip-column exorcist" remains decorative—it never constrains a choice or creates friction in this reconnection scene. Margot's accusation about speaking in riddles when truth is heavy lands well, showing prior patterns through conflict. The six-year silence and Eleanor's fear-based withdrawal are dramatized adequately, though the final beat leans toward summary rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara exists only as a container for abstract movement through conceptual space. No contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. The "journeying inward while walking out" remains pure assertion without dramatized internal conflict or cost. No choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aira's interiority is consistently embodied through physical actions (squinting, pressing palm to glass) and her relationship with the clocks shows genuine devotion. The seventeen-year motif and her decision to "smile...content to tend her clocks for seventeen years more" suggests endurance with cost, though the choice feels more declared than dramatized through competing impulses. Internal contradiction is minimal; her peculiarity is told rather than shown through a difficult on-page decision. The final stance of contentment reads as acceptance but lacks visible forfeiture of an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, grounded in her dual identity as professor and daughter. The internal contradiction between understanding probability and watching her father chase risk is well-drawn. However, the hospital-bed realization feels somewhat abstract—"stopped calculating odds and started seeing something else entirely"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to interpret the scrawls as "invitations to stop playing and start living" arrives more as epiphany than as a decision forged under visible pressure with foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is concretely rendered through specific perceptual habits (knowing tunnel rhythms "the way sailors know tide charts") and her cultivated practice of witnessing strangers. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between connection and estrangement, but her choices remain observational rather than tested under pressure—she waits, listens, answers, but no on-page decision alters her stance or forecloses a path. The final beat ("The phone rang") promises agency but delivers none within the text, leaving motivation articulated but not dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied moments like tasting sea air on the locket and breathing in fragrance "until it became part of her." Internal conflict exists but mostly operates through reflective contradiction rather than simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice to "continue to preserve" reads as affirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost; the covenant is regenerated through acceptance, not through a struggle that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The logistician's motivation is signaled early and their elusiveness as penance creates internal contradiction. However, the protagonist's choices feel somewhat passive—the station visit is driven by external summons, and the key revelation ("I need someone to remember my name") arrives as surprise rather than earned struggle. The woman on the platform remains functional but flat, and the "desperately jocular" trait is more told than dramatized through constrained choice. The final laugh feels asserted rather than embodied with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find stillness is signaled but her agency remains largely passive—she follows the ring's guidance rather than making active choices that narrow options. The moment she "wept without sadness" and the final realization lack embodied contradiction; the interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("the architecture of her own soul") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, and the journey reads more as meditative absorption than a choice-driven arc with visible cost. Blindness as trait is mentioned but doesn't generate on-page mistakes or complicate her navigation in ways that force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is distinct and embodied through her relationship with the pen and her patient approach to signal interpretation. Internal conflict emerges in her acceptance of the "wrong seeds" error and her comfort with uncertainty, though this remains more reflective than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sit with the universe rather than rush the report shows character-specific restraint, but the stakes of this decision feel muted—no visible cost or path foreclosed. Micro-choices are present (adjusting frequency, touching the pen) but lack the pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values under genuine duress.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority shows contradiction—grief paired with emerging understanding—embodied in physical signing that maps emotion. The "old man" serves as catalyst but remains an abstraction; his departure is unmotivated and his actual influence on Marina's choices unclear. Elena's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned by Marina's agency, and the final "translate" declaration asserts transformation without showing what specific path she's foreclosing or what cost she's paying beyond continued grief.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The library-burning backstory is told in summary; the Archive exploration lacks moment-to-moment choices that reveal her limits or internal friction. "Analytically intuitive" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains options with visible cost. The three-year coda tells rather than dramatizes any transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's agency is present through her choice to stay ("withdrawn consent") and her secret drumming ritual, but motivation clarity wavers—the "quiet rebellion" remains abstract until the final scene. Internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her discomfort with scientists' reductiveness doesn't meaningfully constrain choices on the page. The entangled-memory premise and Mira's dream feel narrated rather than somatically inhabited, reducing embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interiority is consistently grounded in sensory particulars—"steel groaned in fog," she can identify Dmitri's walk from fifty meters—and her decisions flow from established competence and loss. The zodiac coin and key carry intentional weight without therapeutic self-analysis. Minor slip: the final moment with Captain Reyes offers validation rather than internal contradiction, softening what could have been a harder-won stance. The closure choice feels clean but the path to it is a bit too frictionless given eleven years of whispered authority.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's nineteen-year silence and dental-mirror work are concrete and purpose-driven, though her interiority relies heavily on summary ("she had learned," "she understood") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The boy's suicidal ideation is conveyed through physical markers (slope of shoulders, edge of secret) with restraint, but his interior remains opaque—we observe him through her lens without friction. The final shared gaze offers a moment of witnessed connection, yet no on-page micro-choice by either party forecloses a path with visible cost; the transformation is asserted through atmosphere rather than dramatized decision.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eleanor is presented through abstract qualities ("teaching children how to think in silence," "cultivated patience") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through pressure; the text tells us she "simply smiled" when questioned but never shows her struggling with competing desires or blind spots that force a visible choice. The ability to "hear what others only thought" functions as a label without clear cost or constraint shaping her decisions. No on-page choice forecloses a path with felt consequence—the ending summarizes growth ("something was growing") without anchoring it in Eleanor's personal renunciation or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interior life is built through embodied detail—"hands sure, steps fluid"—and the scrimshaw functions as a concrete anchor for her emotional guardedness. The shift from locked to open carries some weight, but the epiphany arrives largely through reflection rather than contradiction acted out in scene. The whale's call operates more as catalyst than as pressure that forces her to choose between competing goods. Internal conflict is present but tilts toward summary of her armor-building rather than contradictory impulses playing out simultaneously under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"cultivating lightness in grief" is embodied through whittling, dramatic narration that games surveillance. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between performing compliance and private defiance, and between claiming moral ambiguity while memorializing her mother. The final renunciation (keeping the blank face as "defiant" rather than mandated) carries visible cost: she remains isolated, her grief perpetually coded. Minor deduction: the self-descriptor "I am morally ambiguous" reads label-like rather than shown through action, and past cruelties "performed in the name of art" remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is characterized primarily through aesthetic observation and proclaimed certainty rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior experience relies heavily on abstract declarations ("tremor of certainty," "aesthetically driven heart") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The walking-through constitutes minimal agency—no live options are foreclosed, no visible cost paid beyond the act itself. Motivation remains a told condition rather than a dramatized conflict between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is largely observation-driven rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The apprentice's realization moment ("You see the beauty") arrives cleanly but his prior characterization is thin—steady hands and curious eyes don't dramatize internal conflict. The gift of the reed tongue feels motivated by Mira's established pattern of bartered awakenings, but her decision to pass it forward lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page. Embodied emotion is present in gestures and arrangements but remains externalized; we see her smile and arrange leaves without access to competing desires that would charge the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is consistently filtered through her profession and shows embodied engagement (holding lens to ear, moving between wings). Internal conflict between manufacturing authenticity and creating genuine experience is established, though it operates mostly at the conceptual level rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final understanding about constructing meaning feels more like thematic summary than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Micro-choices are present (collecting fragments, placing the lens) but remain observational rather than pressing against competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority carries voice-specific texture ("scattered like crushed pearls"), and the mentor backstory anchors her present practice. The offering of the pendant demonstrates micro-choice. However, the new arrival remains a passive foil without distinct contradiction or resistance; she cycles through confusion-recognition-wonder in a single beat without embodied friction. The closure choice ("come... meet yourself") lacks visible internal cost or foreclosure—Elara's stance doesn't shift from centuries of practice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority is consistently filtered through her cartomancer lens and her reading of Soren carries embodied observation ("hollow eyes," "hands trembled"). Internal contradiction appears when she recognizes his compulsion to map chaos while practicing her own form of pattern-seeking, though this could be sharpened. Soren's confession and visible easing show change, but his transformation feels more told than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The phrase "inherited mystery" recurs as a thematic label rather than being dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is present but drifts into abstract philosophizing without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure. The seventeen-year journey and transformation at the end are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost. Motivation shifts from "pure scholarship" to "something more desperate" without on-page friction that forces a choice between these impulses. The final surrender reads as conceptual realization rather than a decision with felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly textured with concrete contradictions—she preserves hope while feeling "luminous regret," handles the river stone to remember weight. The character's motivations are established early and her micro-choices (pausing at the footage, choosing not to probe memory gaps) reveal hierarchy of values. However, the work itself remains abstract; we never see her gather hope fragments in a way that forces a choice with visible cost. The ending renews her vigil without dramatizing a path foreclosed or a stance crystallized through on-page pressure.

    Mara's interior work is mostly embodied through concrete action—restoring the tail tip scale by scale as she processes Aldric's betrayal. The metaphoric layering occasionally tilts toward diagnostic clarity ("the fragile architecture of her new understanding") but her micro-choices (picking up tools, examining handiwork, preparing to face staff) ground the emotional arc. Internal conflict between former certainty and new doubt operates simultaneously rather than in neat stages. The final stance—standing in wreckage without false comfort—feels earned by the night's labor and carries visible cost (loss of the beautiful belief).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior journey from self-blame to acceptance shows embodied emotion (cold stone, scarred palms pressed to handprints) and the final act of touching her brother's prints is earned by the coffee-ring revelation. However, the telepathy with plants feels ornamental rather than a genuine constraint that complicates choices, and the grandmother's waiting vigil is told rather than pressuring Maya's present stance. The recovery-from-surgery frame provides physical grounding but doesn't genuinely limit her agency in the tunnel sequence. Internal contradiction is present (denial vs. love) but resolves too cleanly without visible cost beyond acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority is filtered through her psychometry gift, but her motivations remain largely declarative rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The sisters' backstory is vivid and embodied (Clara's straight back, Margot's trembling), yet Mira herself makes no difficult choices on the page—she arrives, reads, weeps, and leaves the reel as found. Her decision to leave the film hidden feels philosophically tidy rather than earned through internal conflict or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Seraphine's interior is laden with abstract labels ("remembered stardust," "moonstruck dreamer") that function as poetic placeholders rather than embodied contradiction. The epiphany ("creativity could not be seized. It had to be surrendered to") arrives as direct statement rather than emerging from dramatized experience. Agency is minimal: she stands, lowers herself, closes her eyes—none of these choices foreclose a live option with visible cost. The final "pour forth" is asserted, not shown through a concrete micro-choice that changes her world.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's role as "dreamless freight guard" and her stance crystallization ("I cultivate the sparks") demonstrates character-specific worldview under pressure. The exchange with the merchant reveals contradictory impulses—protection versus understanding—that inform her final refusal. However, her interior life remains somewhat abstract; the chess clock and archive matter more as symbols than as objects that test her personally. The final choice to continue walking feels more thematic than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cyrus's philosophical interiority is established but operates almost entirely in abstract registers—"questions themselves had grown teeth," "the hum of insight"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The translocating-during-sleep trait is mentioned but never constrains a waking choice or generates friction. The final step through the doorway reads as acceptance rather than a decision with visible cost; no competing impulse or forfeited path appears on the page. Internal conflict is asserted through metaphor but not dramatized in contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The woman's interiority centers on metaphorical self-awareness rather than embodied contradiction—"freedom can feel like drowning" reads as polished insight, not lived confusion. Her joint-protesting rise and heartbeat's "quiet stubbornness" ground the closing choice, yet peak moments lean toward diagnostic clarity ("who she had been and who she might become") instead of messy impulse. The leash-release is earned by cumulative pressure, but the final step feels inevitable rather than costly in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular (nerve regeneration tingling, silent choir background), and the final realization about safety as "quiet accomplice" grows from the bolt discovery. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction in action. The peak insight—"unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe"—reads as arrived-at wisdom rather than a choice forced by immediate pressure, limiting the felt cost of his stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Threnody is present throughout but makes no dramatized choices under pressure; her "endless vigil" is told rather than tested. The piece summarizes her purpose and methods across centuries without a single on-page micro-decision that forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The final "she returned to her endless work" is static description, not a choice with visible cost. Motivation exists only as exposition; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion appears in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is grounded in embodied observation ("tapping marked time, signaled data collection intervals") and her history with the bleaching. Her discovery of the coral colony and shift in tapping rhythm show micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is present but understated: she moves from mourning vanished paths to recognizing transformation without strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father's cartographer legacy anchors motivation but remains largely reflective rather than pressuring a peak choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is generally concrete and embodied through sensory details (bare feet on metal, hum through the floor). However, the character arc relies heavily on performed confidence becoming real and the decision to "create meaning" rather than find it—moves that feel more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to carry the hum to others arrives without visible friction or competing desires that would give it genuine cost. "Awkwardly confident certainty" is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal hesitation alongside resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yara's interior life shows concrete grounding through plant-hearing ability and family history, with credible fear driving her silence. However, the final choice lacks visible cost: unsealing the chamber reads as consensus affirmation rather than a renunciation that forecloses another path. Anya's "insurgent" label is asserted without internal contradiction or embodied stake, and the embryo's "pulse" at closure replaces character agency with magical ratification.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's embodied trauma response is well-executed through concrete somatic detail: soil beneath fingernails, stem resistance, temperature against cheek. The freeze moments show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("her body threw itself toward ground without her permission") and the final choice with the cereus demonstrates earned endurance. Interiority occasionally slips toward therapeutic language ("somatic markers," "nervous system doing what it needed") that feels diagnosis-adjacent rather than lived experience, though the embodiment usually anchors it. The renunciation of healing-as-destination with visible cost (years of isolation, photograph kept crumpled) meets the change/endurance requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior texture is consistent—artist's perception shapes her noticing throughout. The shift from fragmentation-as-curse to fragmentation-as-gift is dramatized through her hands-on work with the cards, and the final stance (redesigning herself) carries cost in that she abandons her prior insistence on singular truths. However, the epiphany "they had always been multitudes" edges toward diagnostic clarity that feels unearned mid-crisis, and the noblewoman backstory remains ornamental rather than driving a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tracker's motivation is established—investigating Vasquez's disappearance and understanding temporal phenomena—but his choices are primarily observational until the final dissolution. Internal contradiction exists in "serene anger," yet this remains a label rather than embodied through competing impulses in action. The ending choice to touch the ink and dissolve feels more passive surrender than earned decision with visible cost; we don't see him weigh alternatives or foreclose a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is abstract philosophizing about time and the universe's patience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's internal conflict between duty and truth is declared ("bravely conflicted") but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to transmit arrives cleanly after a brief contemplation, without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives—her hands stop trembling and she simply acts. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("the foundation of everything...began to crack," "each sentence a small apocalypse") rather than character-particular perception. The final choice reads as inevitable from the start, lacking the friction required to earn the renunciation of her eleven-year role.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira's choice to tend roses rather than follow her father's path is established but primarily through summary and retrospection. The character's interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("senselessly perceptive," "patience she had not known she possessed") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending stance—peace as tending what can be saved—feels philosophically articulated rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Agency exists but is largely reflective rather than tested by live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Morwen's cool-headedness is established through thirty years of experience and demonstrated in his patient approach, but his interior life remains somewhat distant—we see actions (zigzag movement, raising the spike) without much embodied contradiction or struggle. The transliteration of emotions into the spike's weight/color is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final moment of "voicing silence" feels more like fulfilling a prophecy than a choice earned by visible internal conflict, though the renunciation of noise over grasping is a credible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's observational nature is established through concrete past examples ("the way her father paused before lying"), but her interiority leans toward articulate analytical summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "proof by contradiction" realization feels like a logical exercise rather than a wrenching choice with visible cost—she moves from accusation to counter-theory smoothly without dramatized internal resistance. The micro-choices (gripping the railing, turning the pen) are present but don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values; the decision to descend and investigate feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's guilt over her sister's death provides consistent motivation, but interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("something more desperate and something less") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "rewrite what time had folded into permanence" arrives without dramatized internal conflict—we see no wavering, cost assessment, or competing impulse in the moment. Her constellation tattooist profession feels ornamental; it's mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure until the final metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's interior life is vivid and embodied ("tremor in her fingers," "valued permanence the way one values a comfortable wound"), with contradictory impulses present—she is whimsical yet serious, seeking meaning yet repelled by certainty. The micro-choice to place the tile flake into the mandala center feels earned by her sensory listening and charged state. However, the final insight ("order and chaos were the same thing seen from different angles") edges toward thesis-speak rather than discovery earned through sustained on-page struggle. The closure renunciation (letting drawings die when they need to) has visible cost but lands slightly soft, more permission than forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysara's retrocognitive affliction is rendered in concrete detail ("children circling the central fountain," "call to prayer echoing"), and her commitment to preservation generates the story's stakes. The renaming action at closure feels motivated by her established pattern-reading ability and protective stance. However, Soren remains largely a recipient rather than a co-agent; his silent nod and "ancient eyes" label his state without embodied contradiction or micro-choice that would demonstrate internal conflict. The final gift of "arms of steel" resolves through Lysara's will alone, which limits the relational crucible and makes the closure feel more declarative than earned through shared struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (forty-seven years tethered, understanding despair) but her interior contradicts itself: she "tasted violets when she heard grief" yet the synesthesia never constrains a choice or creates friction. Mira appears late and remains a cipher—her "catastrophic audition" is told, not shown, so her despair reads generic. The final "choice" ("Mira reached out and touched the coin") lacks prior struggle; she simply accepts the gift without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's "affectionate skeptic" stance is voiced but enacted weakly; her skepticism dissolves on contact with the crystal without meaningful internal resistance or cost. The somatic-marker framework (breath, heart rate, shoulder tension) provides concrete embodiment, yet the final pivot to "document everything, share her findings" arrives as assertion rather than earned choice under pressure. The telepathy-pill backstory anchors her wariness but remains expository; no on-page micro-choice dramatizes the conflict between her desperation for connection and her distrust of shortcuts. Internal contradiction is stated ("skepticism warring with hope") but never forces a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's interiority relies heavily on abstract sensory claims ("emotional residue," "heat signatures") that are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final realization "she was not documenting the unknown. She was becoming its voice" reads as a declared epiphany without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. No secondary character pressure tests her stance; the piece tracks a single observer moving through reflection without genuine struggle or foreclosed options. Motivation remains Tell-heavy and lacks the embodied contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is presented through label-heavy reflection ("quietly inspired," "patient enough to collect") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her epiphany about the jar and the button catalog feels delivered rather than earned through visible struggle. The final paragraph's diagnostic summary ("humble enough to understand that wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied") reads as therapy-speak that replaces embodied cost. No genuine internal conflict surfaces; she glides from curiosity to insight without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to deliver the pillbox and find her dormant courage is clear, but her interior often slips into abstract reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The burned-face detail and basement convalescence are concrete, yet the moment of extending the pillbox feels more summary than earned decision-making under visible pressure. The "unused courage" motif remains conceptual rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman's interiority is consistent and voice-particular, with the yarn needle and palimpsest promise providing concrete anchors. However, the piece delivers primarily reflective summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the grandmother's promise is explained rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final choice—stepping onto the barge—feels inevitable without visible cost, more culmination than transformation. Motivation is told and layered beautifully, but lacks the micro-choices under duress that would elevate it past mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is richly textured and character-particular ("phototropic to kindness," clay memory), with embodied perception throughout. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; her choices (walking three days, picking up the lantern, sitting to look through it) do not demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or high-stakes internal conflict. The final decision to take the lantern home feels stated rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path. The potter framing bracket is elegant but does not advance agency.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority shows embodied grief and pragmatic patience, but key choices feel guided rather than internally conflicted—she moves smoothly from observing to consoling without friction. The girl's grief is touchingly rendered, yet her shift from tears to learning feels too tidy, lacking the ragged edge of a child in fresh shock. The father's memory provides backstory that anchors present intention, but no micro-choice tests competing impulses under pressure. Motivation is legible and consistent, but the arc lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear—she mourns extinct species and seeks to transform isolation into independence—but her internal contradictions remain static rather than acting in scene. The reincarnation memory and her relationship with extinct species are told in reflective blocks rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The final shift ("isolation would finally translate into its opposite") is asserted rather than earned by on-page cost. Emotional progression relies on therapy-speak ("hard-won connection") and label-only interiority at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's profession as a ghostwriter is established with texture ("She worked in whispers"), and her observation of the nest yields an internal shift. However, the move from "keeper of secrets" to "weaver of connection" feels more like thematic articulation than a choice under contradictory pressure. The final decision to build the installation arrives as resolved insight rather than an on-page struggle between competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present but the stakes remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear and her skills are established, but her interior life remains flat—choices feel procedural rather than agonized. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears as assertion rather than embodied contradiction. Her technical competence never faces genuine struggle; she calculates counter-frequencies without error or cost, undermining the premise that she's improvising against ancient beings. The final stance ("cautious hope transformed into something steadier") tells rather than shows stakes internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia is embodied through physical sensations ("breathing slowly through mounting panic"), and her decision to continue despite fear shows contradictory impulses in action. The grandfather backstory anchors her motivation concretely, though the final transformation from terror to defiance feels somewhat rapid given the weight of lifelong phobia. Internal state remains consistent and her choices drive the plot, but the ease with which she conquers her fear in the closing lines lacks the struggle the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's methodical preparation and perceptual aperture are clearly drawn, but her process remains abstract—she "feels for the counterweight of opposite emotion" without dramatized struggle or micro-choices under pressure. The mother's Alzheimer's backstory is told rather than anchored to a present choice that shifts her stance. The ending gesture (rolling the canvas) feels performative rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, leaving motivation declarative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her emotional trajectory follows a coherent arc from dutiful cataloguer to truth-seeker. However, the character work relies heavily on summary rather than scene-level contradiction—her "nervously confident" attribute is told rather than enacted in pressure moments, and the final stance (rising with determined stride) arrives without a visible on-page struggle between competing impulses. The great-grandmother exists only in reflection, never testing Maren's resolve through dramatized cost. Interior voice shows some specificity (the nail habit, ink-stained fingers) but emotional embodiment defaults to label-patterns ("spongey dread," "trembling hands") rather than contradictory physical states under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fiddler's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("luminous disbelief," "impossible testimony") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The hitchhiker's vanishing is told rather than dramatized, robbing the inciting moment of visceral cost. The final choice—tucking the glass into the case and driving on—reads as acceptance without visible friction or forfeiture. Emotional progression is largely summarized through poetic assertion rather than moment-to-moment struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus exhibits a consistent perceptual signature filtered through his father's highway-robber philosophy, and his micro-choices (bringing Elena to the train, pulling out the foreign bill) are coherent. However, his interiority relies heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("territories were stories people told themselves") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elena remains functional but underdrawn; her "dusky harmony" voice is asserted more than demonstrated through distinct speech patterns or choices that reveal internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority is heavily abstract and retrospective ("she had always known," "fifteen years documenting"), with minimal contradiction or embodied emotion under present pressure. The telegram moment offers no micro-choice that alters her stance; she simply understands in a smooth epiphany. Peak beats rely on therapy-speak ("healing words," "burden of knowledge") and diagnostic self-awareness ("witnessed the architecture of unconsciousness") rather than character-particular thought. The final decision to write "for all who would come after" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's internal life is presented through largely externalized description and reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The druid's "guarded" nature is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The motivation to fix his failure is clear, but the character's decisions feel pre-determined rather than wrestling with genuine ambiguity. Embodied emotion is present ("weight lift from his chest") but the interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("warlike serenity") rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is rooted physically but mobile in consciousness, a constraint that shapes the entire narrative. Interior texture is rich—"anxious elation fluttered in her chest"—and the decision to plant the clipping is earned by decades of observation. However, the visionary's interiority often abstracts into declarative summary ("she had learned to heed such gestures") rather than embodying contradiction in the moment. The climactic planting feels more ritual-complete than choice-under-pressure, limiting visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early and remains coherent, but her trajectory feels predetermined rather than tested by contradictory impulses. The "fiercely gentle resolve" is asserted repeatedly without embodied contradiction—she trembles but never wavers, making the final transaction feel inevitable rather than chosen under pressure. The sister-apparition appears too late to create relational friction, functioning as confirmation rather than complication. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophical labels ("dusky resolve," "architecture of being") rather than character-specific perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interior life is concrete and embodied through the speaker grille cloth ritual and his methodical appraisal work. The "confident uncertainty" trait shapes his professional approach but remains more label than lived contradiction in peak moments. His choice to drive to Elko feels motivated by accumulated pressure, though the final decision lacks visible cost on the page—he simply resolves to go tomorrow without forfeiting anything immediate. Internal conflict between his roadie past and appraiser present is articulated but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and anchored in cuneiform translation expertise, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("dreams that haunted her ambitions," "scholarly desperation"). The final transformation—from fame-seeking to understanding-as-act—is told more than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The weeping moment at the end gestures toward complexity but labels the emotion rather than dramatizing the friction between grief and joy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Asa is given embodied texture (bronze hands, gears, lamplight eyes) and her motives are clear, but she executes ancient duties without internal contradiction or choice under pressure. The identities she tends remain abstract—thoughts of self seeking shelter—never dramatized as entities that resist or complicate her work. No on-page decision alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost; she welcomes, catalogs, and smelts in serene repetition. The final paragraph reiterates her welcome script without deviation, offering no earned change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margret's arc from evaluator to confessor is clear, grounded in her professional lens ("measuring reinforced concrete") that evolves through concrete action (reading the shell, lifting the pearl). Internal contradiction appears when she reaches then stops, creating a charged hesitation. The epiphany about walls feels slightly over-articulated ("she had forgotten what humans actually needed") but her final choice to send the shells ties embodied cost to her new stance. Interiority occasionally leans abstract ("humanity built walls") but recovers through sensory anchoring and the micro-choice at the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath catching) and clear motivation arc from survival through stability to self-forgiveness. The protagonist's internal contradiction—blaming herself while seeking not to—drives choices throughout. The accordion as grounding object and the decision to hold rather than play shows constraint. Minor deduction: the epiphany moment ("she understood now why the maps had drawn her here") edges toward convenience, though it's partially earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains passive throughout, observing and following rather than making choices that narrow options. Interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical declarations ("cautious exuberant," "veiled dreamer") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandfather's backstory occupies substantial space but never tilts a present choice—his whispered promises and explanations are told, not dramatized through micro-decisions. The final "opening" forecloses nothing; no visible cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interior contradictions are present—the buried dream versus research career—but her micro-choices under pressure remain abstract. The wisteria's backstory about the countess introduces a second character's stakes that dilute focus. The final bow-lift reads as gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost; we don't see what she surrenders or gains on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's profession is established, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("practiced reverence," "quiet purpose"). The young man exists only as patterns in static; no dramatic relationship pressure tests her choices. Her final action—preserving the spark—feels predetermined rather than earned through visible contradiction or cost. The backstory about grandmother and thirty years of work anchors motivation but doesn't create embodied struggle in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's contemplative interiority is consistent and her forgiveness decision is earned through dramatized climbing and reflection. However, the final epiphany about contentment-as-process arrives through extended abstract reflection rather than a scene choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The brother Aldric exists only in summary; his presence might have created crucible pressure. Internal contradiction is present (searching despite peace) but the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than embodied in a difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is specific and her profession-shaped perceptual signature comes through in lines like "sincerely insincere patience" and "cloak of doubt." However, the final choice to meet "tomorrow's client" is structurally identical to her existing practice—no path is foreclosed and no visible cost appears on the page. The piece catalogs her methods (wind chimes, mirror shard, performed patience) without forcing a contradiction or trade-off that would compel renunciation or alteration. Under pressure, the protagonist remains entirely in control, undermining the requirement for genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mina's interiority is concrete and particular ("feeling its weight in her palm, considering its purpose"), and her final choice to throw her own stone emerges from dramatized understanding rather than assertion. The researcher remains more symbolic cipher than character—his choices are present but lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "not old" construction and "brightness of someone who had not yet learned to weep" lean toward clever descriptor over lived psychology. Mina's shift from passive watcher to active participant earns the change, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stone skimmer's interiority is detailed but static: centuries of meditation and observation yield no genuine internal contradiction or struggle. The "pulse that had been left wandering in her chest" and her mastery through stillness are established early but never tested by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No micro-choices under pressure materially alter her stance; her navigation is described rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The final acceptance of peace reads as assertion rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal progression from quiet keeper to mist-walker reads cleanly, and the keystone encounter triggers embodied response ("surprised by its warmth"). The fifteen-year wait establishes stakes, but the final realization—"she had been preparing"—edges toward stated epiphany rather than enacted cost. The choice to lift the keystone and accept the mist feels inevitable given setup, yet lacks a visible price or foreclosed path that would anchor the transformation in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and specific—"light left fingerprints on the world" establishes a perceptual signature tied to his occupation. His nineteen-year vigil and three-year underwater searching demonstrate sustained commitment, yet the final realization ("not something to be found but something to be received") arrives through passive waiting rather than a micro-choice that costs him something concrete. The father's deathbed riddle motivates the search but feels more like a narrative device than an embodied contradiction that Elias wrestles with in scene. The protagonist endures and witnesses beautifully, but agency at closure remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is concrete and her motivation to witness/translate is clear, but the piece relies heavily on reflection without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure. The character's "quietly enthusiastic" nature is told more than shown through micro-choices. Her final realization feels asserted rather than earned through struggle—she arrives at understanding without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The grandmother functions as pure backstory without applying immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Melencolia's motivation—naming fears to make them bearable—is embodied through the atlas action and recording, but her interior remains somewhat abstract. The "hollow chest" literalizes heartlessness in ways that flatten contradiction; we're told love "crystallized" but don't see competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final naming sequence shows micro-choices, yet the progression from grief to resolution feels more declarative than earned through visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mage's motivation is clear and intensifies logically toward the repair work, with his lukewarm magic framed as inadequate yet ultimately sufficient. Internal contradiction appears in his surprise at his own warmth of purpose, though the piece leans toward summary of traits rather than embodied choices under pressure. The final choice to stay and ring the bell demonstrates endurance with cost (his ongoing commitment), but the fishermen's hollow-to-wonder transformation and the mage's self-assessment ("earnestly naive...wise enough") edge toward external validation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to document and preserve the submerged town's memory is clearly established, but her interior life remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The piece tells us she "understood her role now with crystalline clarity" rather than dramatizing the realization through conflicting impulses. Embodied emotion is minimal—most feeling is filtered through metaphor ("stories would remain above the surface") rather than physical sensation. The final choice to arrange photographs feels more like execution of a pre-formed plan than a decision forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's interiority leans heavily on abstract label-speak ("liminal space between knowledge and wonder," "reconciliation between measurement and mystery") rather than embodied contradiction. The epiphany arrives via star-pattern observation without prior micro-choices that test competing impulses on the page. The final realization "she had been the crystal all along" feels declared rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Emotional progression from "secretly sentimental" scientist to open weeping lacks intermediate friction or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and职业-specific, with embodied tension in the white-knuckled parachute buckle grip. However, the characterization remains largely static—observing, calculating, waiting—without meaningful internal contradiction or stakes that test competing impulses. The "watcher's burden" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a choice where the narrator must sacrifice one value for another. Muscle memory and ritual are told more than shown altering a present decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation (defeating emotional numbness) is clear and embodied through the blade metaphor, but internal contradiction remains static—the numbness is declared rather than shown degrading under specific pressure. The clone functions more as symbolic mirror than pressured relationship; their exchange feels like thesis delivery ("You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence") rather than contested stance. The final "crack" in numbness arrives through assertion rather than earned micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks on-page interiority and embodied emotion; we observe ritualized action but never access contradictory impulses or a hierarchy of values under pressure. The character exists as a symbolic conductor performing a predetermined role rather than making choices that foreclose paths. The "mournfully eager" attribute is asserted but never dramatized through micro-decisions with visible cost. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned—the work simply continues as it always has.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.2)
    The guardian's interiority is label-heavy ("dimensionally homesick," "the ache that lived behind her sternum") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The seventeen-winter vigil and the pendant's arrival set up a change, but the final walk forward reads as abstract transformation without a concrete choice that forecloses a visible path. The protagonist observes and reflects extensively but makes no on-page decision with dramatized cost; "stop waiting and simply walk forward" remains a declaration rather than an enacted trade-off. No secondary character appears to apply pressure or test motive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to interrupt destiny is consistent and her seventeen-year journey creates weight, but her interiority remains abstract—"stoic sensitivity" and "hope had betrayed her countless times" are asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic realization ("the crozier would not burn as fuel...did not require addition but subtraction") reads as intellectual epiphany without visceral embodiment or emotional cost in the moment. The final snapping motion is "neither gentle nor violent but simply inevitable," which evacuates agency and flattens the peak choice into passive necessity rather than a character-driven decision with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's profession shapes her perceptual filter effectively, and her method of "tuning by discarding assumptions" drives the key turn. However, the climactic "experience" remains abstract—"the sensation of the universe itself beginning, over and over"—without embodied micro-choices that would ground the cost. The weeping is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the descent feels like summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's interiority relies heavily on abstract summary rather than embodied contradiction: "resilient positivity" and "made peace with permanent transience" are asserted labels rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final merger action lacks visible cost or conflict—she steps forward "with her heart steady with purpose" in a moment that should expose doubt or forfeiture. Internal state remains diagnostically smooth ("she felt the universe shudder") without the irrationality or competing impulses that would charge the peak beat. The choice to become "the nexus" feels unmotivated by prior causality; no on-page struggle or trade-off forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The architect's interiority is vivid and particular ("rational enchantment," memories overwritten by constructed dreams), but her choices remain observational rather than decisional through most beats. The final sitting-down is an endurance move, yet it arrives without a foreclosed alternative made visible on the page. Embodied contradiction appears in "hands steady despite the warping walls," but the peak moment—when threads glow and geometry warps—lacks a micro-choice that alters her stance or tactics with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's internal life is embodied through the anchor-link ritual and her meditative approach to the work, showing "balancedly curious" through action rather than label. Her motivation to navigate by starlight is clear and consistent, but the ending choice—continuing her journey home after learning the visitors are departing—lacks a visible cost or tradeoff that would elevate the stakes. The grandmother's wisdom about chains is thematically rich, yet Mira's decision at closure feels like continuation rather than alteration or renunciation with foreclosed paths. Minor register drift into elevated philosophical diction ("invisible threads," "patient journey") sits slightly above a working instructor's plausible mid-crisis lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's professional role is established but her interiority leans on elevated diction ("negotiations between worlds," "persistently curious attention") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to "run" at the end feels unmotivated—what cost does she pay, what path does she foreclose? Vera receives strong embodied grief (trembling hands, the whispered belief), but Elena's shift from procedural distance to urgency lacks micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's claustrophobia and her choice to stay are established, but the transition from skeptic to believer happens too quickly without sufficient internal contradiction acting in scene. The final decision feels more concept-driven than earned through embodied struggle—"Her claustrophobia screamed at her to flee" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses competing moment-by-moment. The shift from mentor relationship to mystical union lacks the micro-choices that would reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly rendered through embodied counting rituals and the concrete experience of erasure, but her motivation shifts too fluidly from anger to understanding without sufficient dramatized friction. The architect ghost remains abstract—a thematic vessel rather than a force that applies pressure through contradictory impulses. The final epiphany feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose paths; Mira simply "understands now" without visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to translate texture into sound is established, and her copper-veined physicality is distinctive. However, interiority remains abstract—"feeling the weight of her ancestors' bargain" and "the chance to complete what they had begun" tell rather than embody contradictory impulses. The final choice lacks visible cost; the curse "lifting, transforming, becoming something else" reads as convenient resolution without dramatized price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation is declared ("turn bitterness into cosmic joke") but never dramatized through conflicting micro-choices under pressure. Amari's transformation is told via static-laden phone exposition rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final step forward reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path—what does Mira sacrifice or lose by entering the harmony? Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("frequencies that made the hair rise," "frostbitten hope") rather than character-particular sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation—to reawaken beauty through music—is consistent, but her interior life remains thin. She makes no difficult trade-offs or choices under pressure; the statues simply "step aside" and she walks forward playing. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "pressure behind her eyes" but no contradictory impulses or visible cost when she commits to the orchard's heart. The transformation lacks agency-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus possesses clear motivation (serving people over politics) and his fifteen-year tenure provides credible authority, but his interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The story tells us he "had learned to foster fragile connections by linking absences" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His decision to deliver the medicine feels inevitable rather than costly, as no competing obligation or genuine risk appears on the page to create friction. The boy Aram and the sisters exist as recipients rather than sources of pressure that would test Marcus's values.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carpenter's "quietly persistent nature" is consistently embodied through his methodical approach and refusal to rush, though the trait remains more atmospheric than generative of concrete choices under pressure. His interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("interpreting silence as possibility") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices with visible cost. The singing moment feels unmotivated by prior causality—no earlier cue establishes this rare emotional release, weakening the turn. The final choice to build a carousel with the halo is declared rather than enacted on the page, foreclosing visible agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interior life is concrete and her thirty-year dedication grounds her choices, but she remains largely observational until the ritual. The woman arrives, vanishes, and returns on schedule with minimal friction or misbelief to complicate either character's arc. The ending grants recovery without visible cost—grandmother's memories are simply reawakened and "ready to be shared once more"—which reads as wish fulfillment rather than earned transformation with foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's persistent choice to work odd hours and her sustained cataloguing effort ground her character, but the motivational arc—from patience to recognizing her own runaway dream—arrives through explanation rather than on-page contradiction. The moment she discovers her face in another's photograph feels asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that show her longing. Internal conflict exists but operates as sequential realization rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The palette discovery and vitalization work are shown, but the final recognition that "this was her own" longing lacks embodied cost or visible foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The locksmith's motivation (freeing the philosopher's sealed idea) is coherent, but her seventeen-year journey receives only summary treatment—told rather than tested on the page. Internal conflict is largely absent; she moves through the garden without meaningful hesitation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final discovery ("only prisons...") arrives as epiphany without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin; we get "patient eyes" and "stubborn flame" but little concrete, contradictory feeling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation (recovering stolen memories) and his trait as chronically curious is embodied in decades of fieldwork, but his interior life remains largely expository. The peak emotional moment—weeping when his grandmother's face returns—arrives without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure in the lead-up. His transformation from skeptic to believer is told across three decades rather than dramatized in this scene, flattening the arc. The final choice to continue exploring lacks visible cost; he simply plans tomorrow's expedition without foreclosing any path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's "combative tenderness" philosophy is articulated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The children's terror-to-curiosity shift feels stated rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The walking-backwards habit is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstract declaration ("she understood that the children...needed not comfort but combat") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior world is richly textured through embodied perception ("shears gleaming with a light that seemed to come from somewhere else"), but she never faces a meaningful decision with competing impulses. Her work flows seamlessly from decades of mastery without friction, cost, or hesitation. The seed-planting unfolds as ritual confirmation rather than choice that forecloses a path. No visible mistake, renunciation, or struggle emerges to test her competence or values.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to restore the net is clear and her work shows focused agency, but her interiority remains largely in observation mode—she understands, she feels, she knows—without embodied contradiction or internal friction during the long night. The childhood memory at the end feels like a convenience epiphany rather than a choice she wrestles with on the page. The spirit's tiredness is shown well, but Mira's own emotional progression stays smooth and declarative without the messy ambivalence that would elevate the stakes of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interior is over-articulated with diagnostic precision ("methodically curious by nature," "shielded openness") that flattens her into a collection of traits rather than embodied contradiction. Her decisions—descending, documenting, leaving—lack visible cost or competing impulses; she operates as an ideal archaeologist without genuine struggle. The final ascent mentions "shielded openness" and "reverence" but these remain labels, not choices that foreclose paths. No on-page moment forces her to choose between competing goods with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and specific ("the physics of letting go," her "weary familiarity" with death), and her decision to deliver Eleanor's message reads as earned by the story's causality. However, the piece leans heavily on summary and reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the snow-globe discovery and decision to find the daughter are described more than enacted. Internal contradiction is minimal—her dedication to lost things is consistent—but the final turn lacks visible struggle or foreclosed options that would elevate the characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to be heard is embodied through concrete actions—pressing her ear to metal, mixing phosphorescent salts, singing through mist—but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressed. The ghost balladeer backstory provides thematic depth yet arrives as exposition rather than discovery that alters Mira's present stance. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through her ritual with driftingly alert competence but no competing impulses that would generate genuine struggle. The final harmony feels like culmination of practice rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's "warmly inquisitive" trait is established early and drives the central choice to examine the goggles, though her decision to read the diary feels under-motivated given seven years of service discipline. Her interior response to discovering Jansen's grief and hidden daughter is embodied and particular ("a strange tenderness"), and the final choice to keep the secret carries visible renunciation cost. The character arc from dutiful servant to compassionate keeper-of-secrets is clean, but the violation-of-privacy beat passes without sufficient internal friction to justify the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's internal state is richly embodied through the telescope, grief categorization, and gondola setting. Her motivation—proving empty spaces remember—drives observation choices. However, the emotional cloud-categorizing remains largely introspective without on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths or create visible friction between competing impulses. The final "wholeness...spooling together" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's prosopagnosia is established early and her pattern-perception skill is clear, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—we see what she does more than who she is under pressure. The choice to work through the night and complete the commission feels more dutiful than conflicted; no visible trade-off or personal cost emerges on the page. Her final departure with the coin reads as a completion rather than a foreclosure that changes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and specific ("her pencil worn to a stub," the meditative use of the phrasebook), and her observations drive the discovery. However, the protagonist feels more like a vessel for the plot than a character under meaningful pressure—her curiosity faces no real internal contradiction or cost. The "diligently curious nature" is told and labeled rather than demonstrated through competing impulses. The final triumph is asserted ("savored the moment") without embodied emotion or a visible price paid for the all-night vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thessa's interiority is heavily filtered through poetic abstractions ("dust motes hung suspended like frozen thoughts") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Her journey to the hall of mirrors unfolds without meaningful internal conflict—she moves with "reverent purpose" but never wrestles with doubt, fear, or competing desires. The final "sacrifice" of the gears feels unmotivated because we never see her struggle with giving them up; the choice arrives pre-resolved. Motivation exists as a stated premise (learning "the rhythm of repair") but is never tested or complicated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to guide the settlement toward the garden is present but abstract; her spectral nature shields her from embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The community members (Eli, Lena) receive one-line personality notes ("hoarded resources," "frightened child") that are told rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final moment—ringing the bell and standing in rain—feels declared rather than earned by prior internal conflict with visible cost. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter stance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is poetic but abstract; her motivation to "document beauty at the edge of endings" reads as told philosophy rather than lived contradiction. The final act—kissing the puppet head—is gestural without a dramatized internal conflict that forces a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; phrases like "the weight of a thousand lifetimes settle into her bones like old music" are metaphorical summaries rather than concrete sensory pressure. No second character appears on the page, so relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"reluctant heart stirred against her will" feels lived rather than labeled. Her inheritance of the caretaker role through "a transfer of weight" grounds motivation in physical constraint. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she resents the duty yet moves with practiced expertise, and the final choice to guide the travelers emerges from this tension with visible cost (accepting the burden she never wanted). Minor slip: the grandmother's teaching method ("leaving impressions without touching") reads slightly abstract in context, though it's anchored to foot-placement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and grounded in her profession ("approached grief the way she approached molecular structures"), and the final shift—reframing the chrysalis from abandonment to completion—feels earned. However, the insight arrives through contemplation rather than a choice under competing pressures; the decision to leave already made, she kneels and thinks until guilt "loosens." The backstory of staying in the lab is vivid, but the present scene offers no micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost—she simply arrives, reflects, and departs with new understanding. The passage "guilt was not rational, and Miriam had carried it anyway" reads diagnostic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vendor's motivation to find "the place where stories begin" is present but never contested or complicated by on-page pressure. Her interior monologue remains abstract and exploratory throughout ("she understood now," "she had been drawn here") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose options. The final "purpose" arrives as a meditative epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the piece a solitary contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's gift is clearly established and her motivation coherent throughout, but her interior experience remains somewhat declarative rather than contradictory. The final choice—walking into morning light after redistributing remorse—feels earned by the three-day work sequence, though the embodied cost could be sharper: "sturdy brittle quality" tells more than it shows. Micro-choices during the pavilion work (placing dishes, touching formations) advance pressure, but the protagonist's struggle reads more as skilled labor than genuine internal conflict with competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's motivation to bridge community divides is clear and sustained, but her decisions feel more declarative than embodied under pressure. The interiority remains abstract—"empathetically decisive nature" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Key choices (calling Antonescu, speaking Romanian) arrive as competent moves without visible internal cost or trade-off that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's helix-minded thinking is repeatedly asserted but never shown constraining a choice or creating friction with linear demands on the page. The transformation feels declared rather than earned through embodied contradiction—she simply "understands" her new purpose and "rises as someone fundamentally different" without visible struggle or foreclosed path. The final stance (archeologist of abandoned dreams) emerges through mystical download rather than protagonist agency wrestling with competing desires. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("synaptic pathways reorganize," "neural pathways integrated") rather than concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calyx's motivation is consistent—obsessive pursuit of the Acrid Codex—but her interiority trends abstract and label-heavy ("latent blaze of her obsession," "seeds of vigilance"). The climactic moment where she presses the stone and "understood" lacks embodied cost; the transformation is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through fear to action, but the arc feels more like obstacle removal than genuine struggle with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are clear and consistent—she seeks to create music in a silent world—but her characterization leans heavily on abstract professional identity ("tree-song sculptor," "symphonically-minded artist") rather than dramatized internal contradiction. The hedgehog observation and insulator examination show patience and perception, yet no genuine internal conflict emerges; her choices flow smoothly without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment of success feels unearned because no prior mistake or obstacle tested her commitment with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted, and the piece never forces a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor's interiority is consistently filtered through his chess-teaching precision, with embodied details like the worry stone's "single deep dent" grounding his anxiety. However, the piece offers no on-page choice that tests his motivations under pressure; he arrives, sits, reflects, and rises without contradiction or cost. The final "waiting itself was a kind of teaching" reads as self-soothing epiphany rather than earned renunciation, and no micro-choice forecloses a live option. Internal conflict remains asserted in past-tense summary rather than dramatized in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority is consistent and profession-specific (listening, cataloging frequencies), but her decisions feel too smooth—no contradictory impulses appear in the workshop scene. The clasp-opening moment arrives without visible internal conflict or cost beyond patience; we never see her wrestle with doubt or frustration that would test her pacifist philosophy under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is labeled ("anticipation," "desperately") rather than enacted through gesture or perception shift. The final epiphany about "losing" sounds to understand empathy reads as assertion rather than earned revelation from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kalia's internal arc from ambition to serenity is tracked through concrete actions (tending the flower, journaling, breathing through aversion), and her final harvest demonstrates earned transformation. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("particular hush that wildflowers keep," "undercurrent of wisdom") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic realization—"transforming, breaking itself down"—arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized micro-choices that force competing values into collision. The cost of her shift feels conceptual but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cora's interiority is present—"curiosity was simply another form of hunger"—and her decision to leave the artifact shows agency with visible cost. However, the characterization leans heavily on contemplative observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice feels somewhat predetermined by the chorus of echoes rather than earned through internal conflict. Embodied emotion is thin; most processing occurs as reflective summary rather than visceral response under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's professional competence is consistently rendered through concrete actions (deploying anemometer, photographing stress marks), and her eleven-year career detail anchors her expertise. However, interiority remains primarily professional-observational without meaningful internal contradiction or vulnerability—she moves through the investigation like a skilled technician rather than a person under pressure. The patch functions as exposition rather than a lived contradiction, and no micro-choice reveals competing values or costs. The final paragraph's "hidden mathematics" epiphany reads cerebral but unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Yara's motivation is stated ("prove that wonder was essential") but never genuinely tested on the page; she encounters no meaningful obstacle or internal conflict. The synesthetic blessing is labeled repeatedly but operates as ornamental description rather than a trait that forces difficult choices. The seventeen-day journey and grandmother's coordinates suggest backstory depth, yet the cavern sequence unfolds as smooth execution without contradiction or cost. Emotional embodiment defaults to stock gestures ("tears freeze upon her cheeks") and the ending grants complete success without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is specific and embodied ("three heartbeats haunted her more than the council's judgment"), and her contradictory impulses—grief, self-blame, and emerging understanding—operate simultaneously in scene. The shift from "desperate intervention" to "witness the Weaving… with humble attention" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the guardian path with visible emotional cost. However, Kira's motivation and arc remain largely reflective; the only on-page micro-choice is raising the flute without playing it, which reads as observation rather than a decision that alters tactics. The final realization feels slightly over-articulated for someone mid-crisis, verging on diagnostic clarity ("failure was not a single moment but a long process of small surrenders").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's core motivation to understand emotion through "borrowed personalities" is established, but her interior life remains abstract—we see her method described more than we feel contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed-personality mechanism is explained rather than dramatized with embodied cost; when she holds the halo fragment and "felt her own personality begin to borrow," the moment tells us the process rather than showing a specific emotional collision. The final smile "with seventeen borrowed personalities and her own" reads as a summary label rather than earned transformation with visible internal cost. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship dynamics cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's jitteriness is established early and embodied through tremors and nervous pieces, but her interior life remains thin—most reflection orbits Mira rather than present contradictory impulses. The final turn (accepting the pendant's lesson) arrives via exposition from Mira rather than Elara's on-page struggle between grief and agency. The "something new underneath the nerves, something steady and certain" is told flatly without micro-choices that dramatize the shift. Mira's spectral presence bypasses earned interiority; Elara reacts but does not wrestle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is vivid and concrete, with her sensory engagement in frost-reading grounded in seventeen winters of practice. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; her "assumption shattering" realization feels asserted rather than tested through on-page choices that foreclose options. The micro-choices (tracing patterns, pressing the prism) accumulate texture but never force a trade-off with visible cost. The final shift—recognizing herself as part of the arbor's emotional archive—reads more like epiphany than earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The spinner's interior life is conveyed through ornate description rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her "decision" to unravel herself arrives via summary and epiphany ("understanding now") without prior visible conflict between want and fear. The grandmother backstory sprawls across multiple paragraphs without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics. Embodied emotion is scarce; most feelings are asserted through labels ("trembling in her heart") or stock gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cael's transformation from overlooked blacksmith to silent rebuilder is traced through patient work rather than dramatic choice. His interior life remains somewhat abstract—we see "quietly determined insistence" as label more than embodied contradiction. The final satisfaction "that needed no witness" gestures toward earned change, but the arc unfolds mostly in summary across "three seasons past" rather than in on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure. Motivation is consistent but not tested by conflicting impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interior work is specific and embodied—her sensory mapping ability shapes how she perceives and moves through space. The motivation to find her mentor's truth drives the narrative, though the final "redirection" feels more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cyclical dissociation is label-only; it never constrains a present choice with visible cost. The climactic realization that "the truth she sought was not something withheld by another person but something she had been withholding from herself" lands as therapy-speak epiphany rather than dramatized collision of wants.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's "warmly observant" trait is established early but functions primarily as label rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her stone-stacking choice feels motivated by backstory (grandmother) rather than present pressure testing her reticence against immediate cost. The final act of stacking stones lacks visible struggle or foreclosed alternative; she simply executes what the lighthouse "needs" without embodied hesitation or trade-off. Interior voice remains consistent but never forces Maren into a mistake or credible endurance that would narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—laughter as power, light-bending focus—but lacks contradictory impulses in scene. His motives are asserted ("purpose distilled to its purest form") rather than tested through competing desires or visible cost. The ships appear and turn because he laughs and speaks; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Yuen's interiority is established through his dye-master patience and watchful waiting, but the epiphany feels unearned—he arrives at the tea house already primed for the answer, and the butterfly wing delivers it without meaningful internal resistance or contradiction. The donor-heart premise introduces a second character's influence but remains abstract; no embodied struggle between Yuen's forty-year habits and this "new heart" plays out in micro-choices. The final realization ("some people magnetized stories because they had learned to see value in every tale") reads as summary wisdom rather than a dramatized shift that forecloses a prior path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The warden's interiority is specific and grounded in her nineteen-autumn tenure, but her micro-choices remain observational rather than conflicted under pressure. The astronomer's gift frames her stance, yet we never see her weigh competing impulses or pay a visible price for her work—she simply "begins" at the end. Embodied emotion is largely absent; her climb and sextant use read as reportage. The final descent suggests intent but no foreclosed path or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's role as memory keeper is established through atmospheric interiority, but her agency remains largely passive—she performs ritual acts (swaddling, singing) without visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sacrifice at the end (becoming "less scattered even as she became less whole") is asserted rather than embodied through concrete micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The transformation reads as a conceptual claim ("not a keeper of memories, but a weaver of new ones") rather than a dramatized cost paid through on-page decisions that foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's compassionate-recluse nature is established through extended reflection rather than scene pressure. The core contradiction—empathy driving both withdrawal and return—reads clearly, but the decision to "write her reply" tomorrow remains abstract rather than embodied with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on diagnostic framing ("keenly empathetic," "the cruelty of it") that explains rather than dramatizes internal conflict. The final stance crystallization lacks a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a lived-in path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her observant nature is consistently rendered through concrete micro-choices (training jasmine, weaving brooms, protecting chrysalis). The interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("tenuous absolution," "sacred in ordinary maintenance") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to break bread feels thematically inevitable but lacks a competing impulse or visible cost that would foreclose another path. No other characters apply immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist is characterized primarily through action and observation—her meticulous catalog work, the forty-year tenure, her "gently meticulous care"—but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The transformation from "measuring to preserve" to "measuring to understand" reads as an epiphany rather than a choice forged under contradictory pressures. Her final realization feels more like philosophical arrival than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than embodied stakes that force her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority shows embodied hesitation ("the watch fob cold against her palm") and her final question to the scarred woman demonstrates genuine conflict between seeking answers and preserving her father's token. The motivation is consistent—she pursues information about her father's disappearance through incremental learning from false starts. However, the climactic choice remains incomplete on the page; we see her question "What happens if I keep it?" but the decisive action or renunciation that forecloses a path is deferred beyond the text. The father's backstory occupies substantial space without enough micro-choices in the present to justify the reflection mass.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's skepticism is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her shift toward "wonder" at the end feels asserted ("learning, finally") without prior on-page struggle between competing desires. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("warring with the evidence of her senses") and lacks embodied tension. The encounter with Seren produces no visible cost or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is well-detailed with mnemonically gifted memory and charcoal-stained fingers establishing her observational stance, but her past suppression of Elena's creativity is told rather than shown through prior micro-choices. The pivot from technical judgment to uncorking creativity arrives through reflection and summary ("I remember everything... the years she spent hiding her boldest work because her sister... had taught her that her art was too much") rather than dramatized friction. The final kneeling moment provides embodied action, but the change is not earned by on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost—it resolves through narrated understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear—she seeks lost conversations and her師傅's truth—and her choices (following the map, entering the room, beginning to write) are legible. However, her interior life remains somewhat thin; we get competent description of her profession and her師傅's decline, but little contradictory impulse or embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to write feels thematically appropriate but lacks the visceral cost or internal conflict that would elevate it into high bands. The師傅 functions more as backstory catalyst than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is established through her tuning work and silent communication, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through satisfaction without meaningful friction between wants. The final moment with Juniper offers wordless approval that settles rather than complicates her stance. Motivation is present but not tested by competing desires; the piece favors accumulative mood over character pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "felt the wordless approval settle into her shoulders," though most emotional content remains abstract or labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cara's interiority is vivid and embodied through the rebuilt hands that pulse, the strange organic blood moving through tubes. The motivation to contain chaos is grounded in forty-three years of caretaking particulars. However, the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices—"felt herself fragmenting...felt whole" operates at a high level of abstraction without dramatized cost. The emotional arc toward "fragmented wholeness" risks therapy-speak, though it's anchored in concrete action with the box and roses.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her curatorial eye shapes her approach to objects and stories. However, her internal journey is largely observation rather than struggle—she doesn't face meaningful internal contradiction or pay a visible cost for her choices. The grandmother and Mrs. Okonkwo's conflict carries more emotional weight than Elena's arc. Mrs. Okonkwo's revelation and the sister's reunion are told rather than dramatized, flattening what should be peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to liberate is asserted through backstory rather than tested in present choices. The dance sequence functions as explanation rather than decision under pressure; no on-page dilemma forces her to choose between competing goods or accept visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("liberation," "defiance," "becoming") and summary of prior years rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The final smile and forward step declare triumph without dramatizing what she sacrifices or risks losing in this chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior is established through her role and seventeen-year trajectory, but her choices in the present frame remain observational rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses under pressure. The backstory load (mother's death, exhumation, coffee-ground divination, seventeen years of service) floods the text without anchoring in micro-choices that alter present tactics. Emotional states are labeled ("her mind elsewhere," "driven for seventeen years") rather than embodied through contradictory physical action. The final touch of the crystal feels inevitable by setup but is not earned by on-page conflict between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The summoner's interiority is consistently filtered through a lush, philosophical lens, but her choices feel more contemplative than conflicted. The decision to "smooth" rather than "fight" the prophecy unfolds as a meditative process without genuine internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final realization—that the prophecy was a warning from her future self—arrives as exposition rather than earned through on-page struggle. While the character's stance is clear, the lack of embodied contradiction or visible cost in her choices keeps this in the functional band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is present but often operates at a remove—her "motivation sharpened from mere curiosity into something closer to necessity" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The tutor remains opaque by design, which serves the concept but limits relationship dynamics as a crucible. The final choice ("I don't need to know") crystallizes Elena's acceptance with visible cost (foreclosing the path of full truth), but the journey there lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; much relies on metaphorical language rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is detailed and specific ("trained to dismiss pattern-recognition errors"), and her skepticism is embodied through actions (palm against jasmine, adjusting grip). The shift from skepticism to acceptance feels too smooth given her scientific training—the "quiet acceptance" lacks the contradictory impulses that would mark genuine struggle. Her grandmother Elena is vivid through backstory but never acts on the page, reducing relational pressure. The final choice to "find the other half" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    Yuki's interiority relies heavily on abstract, lyrical labels ("liminal glow between darkness and color where secrets could be spoken without shame") rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. The character's transformation from forger to truth-restorer is asserted through metaphor rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The final realization about "unlinking herself from the chain of complicity" reads as diagnostic label-speak that replaces embodied emotion. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the work proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand echo people is established through extensive backstory (~30%+ reflection), but her agency remains observational until the final paragraph where she "stepped into the heart of the song" without a prior on-page choice that visibly narrows options. The forty-season backstory and grandmother's seashell provide context but flatten present urgency. Interiority leans toward diagnostic phrasing ("a wound that never fully healed," "trapped frequency") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is present as a skilled investigator, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("singular method," "patient work") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The story tells us she "weaves truth carefully" and has "crystalline clarity" about her purpose without dramatizing internal conflict or showing her struggle with competing desires. Her final decision to find the living relatives is declared rather than earned through on-page tension between what she wants and what it costs her. No genuine flaws complicate her path; she moves through the investigation with competence but no visible stakes that force her to sacrifice something or face a mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yuki's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with calloused fingers tracing patterns and her philosophical stance integrated with her craft. Her contradiction—philosopher by nature, net-mender by trade—drives her worldview rather than alternating in summary. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure; the whistle and descent feel more performative than choices that foreclose options. No secondary character appears on the page to test her stance through relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira shows competence and observational discipline, but her interior contradictions remain muted. The shift from fragment-collector to truth-finder operates more as professional stance than embodied conflict. Her choice to stay through the dust storm reads as symbolic closure rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak, but interiority leans toward summary of professional method rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's isolation and theoretical convictions are established, but her interiority leans heavily on therapy-adjacent framing ("loneliness was simply the price of seeing") and abstract self-analysis rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final smile is told as hope crystallizing, not earned through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized across years rather than dramatized in present micro-choices under pressure. No secondary character on the page to test relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's transition from sound-collector to meaning-maker is motivated by the music box encounter, but the change feels too smooth and complete. The final paragraph's "he would smile and tell them" leaps years ahead without showing the struggle or contradictory impulses during the shift itself. Elara's backstory provides thematic weight but arrives via exposition rather than pressuring the poet's present choices. The widow-hiring and parent-commissioning work is told in summary, not dramatized with specific on-page costs or refusals.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's interiority reads as concrete and character-particular in the opening beats ("weight of that responsibility settle into her bones"), and her micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the key by fractions of millimeters) emerge from a consistent blend of technical training and emotional inheritance. The motivation—protecting her grandmother's legacy—shapes her actions throughout. However, the final choice lacks contradictory impulse; she executes a technical solution without visible internal conflict or renunciation, so the emotional progression feels one-note at closure. The "logically emotional" trait is asserted more than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's motivation is stated ("patient revolution," "sculpting patience from impatience") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life consists largely of poetic declarations ("unyoke herself," "restrained wildness") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic moment—placing her palm on the viaduct—carries no dramatized struggle or trade-off, only abstract "unyoking" of energies. No genuine flaw or limit shapes her actions; she succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's investigation methodology is clearly established and her frustration with Chen provides internal pressure. However, the sudden supernatural memory transfer ("entangled memories not her own") arrives without groundwork in her prior observations or capabilities, creating an unmotivated knowledge leap that undermines character agency. The final choice to defy Chen and publish independently is earned by her established values, but the pivotal discovery mechanism bypasses investigative work. Her embodied reactions (jaw tightening, heart hammering) provide some grounding, though the emotional progression from discovery to resolution feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thomas's interior life is concrete and particular—his tools arranged "in order of diminishing size," his habit of "stepping back" in matters of redemption—but the interiority often drifts into elevated philosophizing ("words spoken in that institutional setting carried weight beyond their immediate meaning") that feels imposed rather than lived. The decision to add the inscription is a micro-choice under pressure, but it arrives through reflection rather than dramatized conflict. Marcus Webb's backstory provides thematic color but does not constrain Thomas's present action. The woman's grief is gestured at ("trembling hands") but never embodied in choices or friction that test Thomas.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cart glider's interiority is distinctive and voice-specific ("steadily curious disposition," "yearning algorithm"), but key moments lean heavily on abstract constructions ("something that might have been called a soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "ring the bell" feels asserted more than earned through visible internal conflict—the algorithm itself does the work rather than the protagonist wrestling with competing impulses. The piece delivers a consistent persona but lacks the on-page struggle that would charge the closure with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maren's trait as "brightly attentive" reads as label-only rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her investigative decisions follow a linear path without internal conflict or visible trade-offs that would elevate characterization. The final choice ("could restore her, could let the absence remain") is presented as equally weighted options without on-page evidence of which impulse dominates or what personal cost tips the balance. Interiority remains abstract ("understood then why the case had come to her") rather than grounded in contradictory bodily impulses or micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is richly textured—"understanding required seeing clearly what others could not bear to look upon directly"—and her willingness to stand apart from easy answers feels earned. However, the transformation at closure lacks a concrete cost; she walks out "with purpose" but no visible forfeiture or micro-choice that dramatizes what she's given up or risked. The shadows and her peacekeeper nature are told more than embodied in pressure-driven action, and her hierarchy of values remains abstract rather than tested through incompatible goods.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly rendered through embodied detail—the parasol tip worn smooth by handling, the particular weight of sea-claimed bodies—but the core motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The actuary background and "grips reality loosely" attribute feel label-only; they don't visibly constrain choices or generate friction. The final turn toward acceptance reads as contemplative summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is established through embodied detail (weathered hands, boots finding furrows) and the burned letter fragment anchors his past concretely. However, the piece trends toward exposition rather than contradiction in scene—his grief has "transform[ed] into something gentler" without on-page struggle or competing impulse. The final acceptance reads as summarized wisdom ("love's purpose was not always permanence") rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Agency is contemplative observation, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority is presented largely through abstract meditation ("the seeing done not by looking directly but by sensing what brushed against the edges of awareness") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to preserve wisdom is told via reflective summary in the second-to-last paragraph, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The mask's bifurcated perception remains symbolic rather than constraining a specific on-page choice. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from her walk; she ends where she began with no alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's interior is present but rarely embodied under pressure; her "perceptively calm attention" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices. The photograph repair is treated as contemplative ritual without visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path. Her motivations ("help them remember," "transmute pain into masterpiece") remain abstract declarations rather than lived friction, and no genuine flaw complicates her choices. The ending grants gratitude and satisfaction without dramatized struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through selective attention and micro-choices (taking the crystal, returning it at dawn), with embodied perception filtered through his scholarly lens. Interior access is controlled and voice-particular ("silence was the only currency that mattered"). However, the final stance feels more contemplative than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; his smile and realization arrive without visible internal resistance or foreclosed alternatives. The character remains coherent but the arc trends toward philosophical acceptance rather than a choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's precognitive forgetfulness is established with specificity ("remembered everything about the present moment with devastating clarity while the future slipped through her mind like water"), and her system of driftwood markers shows a concrete coping mechanism. The final shift toward peace is earned by the accumulation of sensory discovery rather than causal action, fitting the accumulative lens. However, the protagonist remains observational throughout; no on-page micro-choice under pressure alters her tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost—she arrives, listens, sits, and achieves alignment without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—the spinning clock hand as grief's displacement, the father's promise as a forty-year wound. The protagonist's realization moves through embodied perception (watching the hand through the lens) to a final micro-choice that reweights the past. Internal contradiction operates clearly: the impulse to stop time versus learning to see motion as constancy. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated epiphany in the penultimate paragraph ("I have finally escaped the gravity of my grief"), which edges toward therapeutic label-speak but remains anchored in the camera work.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's serene acceptance of her diagnosis and decisive kindness read clearly, but her interior world relies heavily on elevated abstraction ("strange clarity," "architecture of grace") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The relationship with Margery shows gentle care but lacks friction that would force a costly micro-choice on the page. Margery's tea-colored eyes and acceptance are sketched but not tested; her grip and final line hint at depth without dramatizing conflicting impulses. The final mutual recognition feels tender but tidy, missing the messy ambivalence that would lift characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is abstract and moves through label-speak ("shiver," "desperate") rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery and circle-walking show her solving the problem competently, but no internal conflict constrains her choices—she pursues the key → walks circles → succeeds without visible cost or foreclosed path. The final "knowledge settled into her bones" reads as an unearned epiphany rather than dramatized change. No micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is embodied and contradictory—"shrewdly innocent about which she claimed to be" and the coexistence of love and uncertainty anchor her stance. The eighteen years of raising the changeling are summarized rather than dramatized, but her present choices (entering the garden, placing the tooth, refusing to identify the body) are motivated and carry weight. The final forgiveness is earned through accumulated particulars rather than declaration. Minor slip: the son's "true eyes" moment is told in summary, diluting what could be a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's transformation from grieving star watcher to sanctuary-keeper is mapped through seventeen years of exile, but the core shift—recognition that the pearl contains trapped light—arrives via convenient discovery rather than earned internal pressure. The "pearl of stillness at the center of her being" reads as diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost in the moment. Micro-choices are absent; she simply "understood immediately" at each turn, flattening agency into passive realization. The final stance feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific, with embodied emotion in the moss-garden visits and the amber pendant handling. However, the mother remains abstract—her "confession" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the narrator's response ("not the cold kind, but the kind that holds space") edges into therapy-speak. The final stance ("simply stay") reads as renunciation, but the cost is asserted rather than shown through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off. Internal contradiction is present (betrayal/pride) but not pressured into a scene-level micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's interior contradiction—wanting to write but frozen by fear—is embodied through her physical journey and the shell fragment. Her final choice to return "toward the page" is earned by the ghostly encounter, though the renunciation feels more told than enacted in micro-choices. The "lucidity that felt both foreign and necessary" and similar constructions lean toward label-speak at key beats, weakening embodiment. Agency registers as attention and endurance rather than decisive action, but the cost of years lost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early and consistently (restore the moonvine), but her seventeen-year wait and decades of study flatten agency into passive preparation. The peak moment—kneeling, positioning the vine, humming—reads as ritual execution rather than choice under pressure; no competing impulse or fear acts simultaneously. The vine's transformation is witnessed, not earned through a difficult decision that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is largely absent; "wept with a joy" tells rather than shows physiological response.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in her grandmother's death and the desire to map heartbeats, but her choices in the present scene feel more ritualistic than conflicted. The interiority leans heavily toward poetic abstraction ("invisible forces that moved through all living things") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final act of sealing the pattern reads as completion of a predetermined sequence rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's interiority is evocative but abstract—her peripheral focus is stated rather than tested under on-page pressure. Her decision to repair via "redirecting purpose" arrives without clear dramatic stakes or visible cost that forecloses a path. The "particular satisfaction of one who had found not a solution but a proper question" reads as philosophical summary rather than embodied consequence, blunting the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The weaver's interiority is concrete and her calcification provides embodied physical consequence. The bargain with the grotto—taking burdens into patterns in exchange for gradual transformation—creates coherent motivation. However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict; she "does not resist" and moves through her work without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arrival memory provides backstory but no micro-choice alters present options, and the final acceptance feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The widow's interiority is concrete and embodied through her carving practice, with consistent grief-driven motivation. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous holding and releasing ("the work was love, and the work was letting go"), though the final paragraph overarticulates this insight in therapy-adjacent language ("grief holds the living and the dead in its patient, practical, haunting hands"). The character's micro-choices—ignoring the kettle, touching the mane—are present but the cumulative emotional progression feels somewhat smoothed rather than contradictory in action. No visible cost forecloses a path; she continues carving without renunciation or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior contradiction—methodical scavenger versus existential negotiator—registers clearly, and her micro-choice to photograph the ghost with accumulated fragments shows embodied agency. However, the moment lacks visceral cost: the ghost "watches" without pressure, and Mira's climactic speech reads as articulate philosophical summary rather than a decision forged under duress. The closing "exhaustion…is a kind of peace" articulates theme but does not dramatize a foreclosed path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's engineering curiosity and problem-solving orientation are consistent, but her interior life remains thin—she moves through discovery to proposal without meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion. The sextant piece triggers calculations and civic vision, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her drive; she's functionally creative as labeled but never struggles with doubt, fatigue, or competing desires. The council approval arrives off-page, removing the chance to dramatize her stake under interpersonal pressure. Competence without genuine friction flattens what could be a richer arc.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interior reflection dominates, with embodied grief ("hands that trembled only slightly") and a clear arc from paralysis to acceptance. The grandfather's unfinished dream and twenty-year paralysis create a coherent motivation, and the final act of winding the clock forecloses the path of avoidance with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("the acceptance of impermanence") that feel slightly removed from raw emotional experience. The bear remains a stage presence rather than a relationship crucible, limiting interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and specific—she seeks to understand "the architecture of lies"—and her decade of training shows through selective perception. However, interiority remains abstract ("quiet accumulation of evidence," "patient reconstruction") rather than embodied. The final realization that Konstantýn was an architect of lies rather than a victim arrives without internal friction or visible cost; she steers toward the next clue with the same serene confidence she began with, foreclosing the opportunity for genuine character pressure or change.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is coherent as a philosophically minded collector, but his internal life is often told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The protagonist's discovery feels more like a cerebral realization than a choice with competing desires under pressure. His grandmother's gift and the "infinitely patient" trait are labeled but never constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The final moment—"already planning"—reads as resolution without foreclosing a credible alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The traveler's profession and motivations are established through vivid interiority—"made a profession of farewells," "writing obituaries for the living"—but remain largely reflective. Internal contradiction exists (haunting a place she never meant to stay vs. choosing to remain), yet choices are limited to sitting, touching the thread, and writing; no competing pressures force a difficult micro-choice that alters tactics. The final realization that she will "become part of the explained absences" reads as epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in the gesture of touching the thread and the "particular reverence," but the lack of on-page conflict limits the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prince's motivation to find a kill-switch versus discovering integration is present but arrives via summary rather than embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is told ("sorrow and hope are finally reconciled") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice feels narrated rather than dramatized with visible cost—he "understood at last" and "began the long walk back" without a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward abstract epiphany ("that particular reverie") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is richly detailed with embodied emotion—black sand pressed to cheek, coin gripped during fires—and the contradiction between inherited restlessness and chosen compassion is clear. However, the arc relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized choice; the final "understanding" about fire and water arrives as epiphany rather than earned decision that forecloses a path. Therapy-adjacent phrasing appears ("unyielding compassion rising in her like a tide," "scars could sing") that slightly softens the voice under pressure. The piece never shows Mira making a micro-choice in scene that alters present options; all conflict is retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's luminous skepticism is established early and her interior voice shows consistent orientation—cataloguing possibilities, refusing easy answers—but her choices remain largely observational until the final sequence. The "unstick" process at multiple fountains demonstrates patience but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would elevate her agency. Her transformation from skeptic to someone who "understands" mysteries reads more as arrival than earned struggle, with the final stance feeling declared rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vael's interiority is consistently otherworldly and textured through sonar-perception and translucency, avoiding stock human gestures. The emotional arc—from ritual custodianship to recognition of the gear's awakening—tracks clearly, though the final choice (leaving the gear "exactly where it needed to be") feels more declared than earned through on-page micro-decisions under pressure. Interior contradictions exist (burden vs. promise, serenity vs. troubling) but remain abstract; no moment crystallizes competing impulses into a visible tradeoff. Embodiment is strong (sonar pings, translucent hand, organic rhythms) but the climax lacks a concrete action that forecloses a path with felt cost.

    Elara's interior life is richly textured with embodied grief and the weight of inherited craft, yet her arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The progression from seeking understanding to achieving it feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she moves through the greenhouse and arrives at insight without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The spectral presence and generational inheritance are evocative but function more as atmospheric backdrop than as pressures forcing difficult micro-choices. Her final understanding is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a renunciation or endurance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular through the rake-handle inscriptions and his weekly ritual, showing embodied guilt. The final choice to descend is mildly undercut by over-articulated reflection ("incremental absolution was not about erasure but about carrying"), which edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. Internal contradiction operates across the story but doesn't fully act simultaneously in peak beats. The renunciation reads earned by prior causality, though the cost feels distributed across years rather than sharply felt on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The gardener's blithe baseline is established but never pressured; his descent and reading lack interior contradiction or embodied cost. The "tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead" and "learning to hear what the dead had tried to say" read as summary labels rather than character-particular impulses tested under stress. The final understanding arrives as declared insight without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; no decision alters his stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interiority is present but abstract—she reflects on decades of work and conceptual tensions without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under immediate pressure. The piece withholds her specific motive for this precise act until the final paragraph, and when it arrives it reads as thematic summary rather than dramatized need. No secondary character applies pressure; the solitary setup limits relational friction. The final beat ("She began to write") gestures toward agency but does not dramatize a forfeiture or trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in a consistent set of values (preservation, resistance), but her interior life leans heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("thistled calm," "diligent," "scientific mind") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece never tests her commitment with a meaningful on-page choice that forces trade-offs; she continues her work without dramatized conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The single-POV interiority is specific in texture but lacks the micro-choices and contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is dense and particular—"charcoal portrait ash scatterer" establishes a specific ritual practice. The grandmother's characterization relies heavily on secondhand reflection rather than dramatized contradiction; Mira's processing feels more like philosophical acceptance than lived struggle. Embodied emotion appears ("pressed the portrait to her chest," tears), but the peak beats lean toward meditative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to carry the fragments feels earned by the ritual logic but lacks visible friction or cost that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and specific—a solitary scholar driven by historical truth against official narrative. Interior contradiction appears in the tension between rational method and acknowledged obsession ("my neighbors think I am mad…but my rational rebellion is not madness, it is method"). However, the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority without embodied emotion or micro-choices that alter present tactics; the narrator describes past recovery work and future cataloging but makes no on-page decision under pressure. The final paragraph reaffirms an existing stance rather than earning a shift through dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's interior life shows texture through the worn rosette gesture and her past trauma, but her choices in the present scene remain largely observational—she positions her fingers, asks a question, begins a scale. The young man's shift from detached resignation to engagement is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The backstory operates within BRR allowances and anchors present stance, but the protagonist's agency at closure reads as witnessing rather than deciding with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's gift is established but her interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("feel the emotional weight," "sense the histories") rather than embodied contradictions. The university backstory adds dimension but the climactic seed-tasting moment ("worlds exploded across her consciousness") defaults to summary labels instead of showing competing impulses in action. The final choice to build a kitchen is stated more than earned through visible internal conflict with cost. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's trait of involuntary truthfulness is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("her involuntary truth rising like bile") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The revelation that she's been "collecting hope" through "small kindnesses" is told rather than shown through prior micro-choices, and the final shift feels epiphanic without the grounding struggle required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" is well-established through specific observational behaviors (tilted photographs, residual warmth on banisters). Her interiority remains consistent throughout, with embodied sensory details like the orris root shard warming against her thigh. However, the story lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her progression toward understanding feels smooth and inevitable rather than genuinely struggled-for. The final realization arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternate path, reading more as epiphany than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thalassor's interior arc—from rigid certainty to embracing contradiction—is tracked through concrete encounters (the alchemist's memory, dialogue with fish and eels). The final choice to share understanding rather than warn is motivated by accumulated experience. However, the transformation relies heavily on told reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; phrases like "kindness without nuance was merely cruelty" read as thesis rather than embodied realization. The embodied cost at closure (remaining as "keeper of questions instead of answers") is present but the path there favors summary over scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and sustained—the need to understand rather than escape—but her "balancedly daring nature" is asserted in exposition rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The dice function more as symbolic instruments than as objects that force difficult micro-choices with visible cost. The ending shift from "escape" to "arrive" reads as a conceptual pivot but lacks the embodied struggle or renunciation that would make it feel earned through prior causality at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is consistently rendered through concrete sensory detail and embodied thought ("fingers already trembling with the familiar ache to create"). The change from loneliness to hope is visible on the page and earned through the daydream sequence, though the final epiphany edges toward label-speak ("the long loneliness of believing that kindness vanished like smoke"). The "methodically hopeful" trait is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses; we see patience but not the cost of that patience. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren's motivation is clear and her role as preserver is consistent, but interiority leans heavily on reflective summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The turn toward bringing arts "back into the world" arrives through contemplation rather than a dramatized choice that costs her something on the page. The beekeeper functions primarily as backstory anchor; his absence is told rather than felt through on-page friction. Internal conflict remains conceptual—loving fragile things—without simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Iris's motivation (fleeing her foreseen death) is clear, but her seventeen-year backstory and the vision in the timepiece are summarized rather than dramatized. The counter-clockwise world-building is evocative, yet her final choice—spinning the yoyo to dissolve reality—reads as abstract rather than embodied with contradictory impulses acting in the moment. The piece delivers interiority through elaborate metaphor ("her mind sharpened into something precise and patient") but lacks micro-choices under immediate pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to confront fear is present but the interiority relies heavily on abstract self-diagnosis ("she had welcomed the water's embrace because the world had become too loud") without embodied contradiction in scene. The confession to the mirror and the transformation feel asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother remains a device rather than a pressure source, and the advisor voice lacks distinct agency that would force Clara's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prophet remains an observer throughout, with no on-page choice that forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses. Interiority is largely absent; we get exposition about her gift ("the title felt more like description than designation") but no embodied tension or micro-choice under pressure. The final smile reads as serene accomplishment rather than earned cost. No character arc or renunciation dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in the lost expedition, but her interior life relies heavily on cartographic observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The whistle moment offers embodied choice, yet the decision to blow it feels more driven by pattern-solving than by competing wants that create genuine internal friction. Emotional states are more described than viscerally contradictory—"sunwashed dread" operates as atmospheric label rather than embodied degradation under stress. The cost at closure (turtles waking, spiral glowing) gestures toward consequence but doesn't yet foreclose a visible path with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dr. Vance's interiority is detailed but presents as scholarly meditation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandfather's moral compromise is told through discovered letters rather than dramatized in scene. The final decision to publish feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose alternatives with visible cost. Emotional processing remains consistently analytical without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would justify higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("read absence the way others read scripture"), and her shift from provincial surveyor to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is signaled early and earned through the pavilion discovery. The embodied cold water and careful handling of the inkwell ground her physicality. Minor slip: the final epiphany about "hushed blaze" edges toward label-speak, though it remains anchored in prior sensory work. The choice to place notes and claim the inkwell forecloses her old path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's perceptual work is credible and her final resolve reads as internally consistent, but she remains largely observational throughout. The "resolve crystallized" ending announces change rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; her shift from cataloger to guardian feels inevitable but lacks an embodied micro-choice under pressure that would lift this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's grief-driven transformation from basilica craftsperson to private maker is established, but her present choices remain largely contemplative rather than dramatic. The interiority is concrete ("polished the gem in slow circles") and the contradiction between building for others versus self is visible, yet the ending choice—watching her daughter's dream and folding another crane—repeats established pattern without a new cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is strong ("luminous torment," grief as "constant luminescence"), but the final beat consolidates rather than transforms, fitting Earned Stasis only if we read the building itself as the renunciation; that reading is available but not charged with fresh cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is dense and specific, anchored in concrete details (the geode, the act of urination, the scorch marks). Motivation is consistent—hunting unused potential through perturbation theory—though the internal contradiction between overthinking and the need to search feels more stated than enacted in scene. The "perturbation theory applied to existential crisis" frame yields micro-choices (holding the geode up to the window, watching the ruins), but the piece leans heavily on reflective processing rather than pressure-tested decisions. Embodied emotion appears in the geode warming in the palm, but much of the grief and survival guilt remains at the level of articulate philosophical musing rather than contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to find "a frequency of belonging" is clearly established and drives her through the observatory, but the interiority leans abstract and occasionally crosses into label-speak ("perpetually surprised" functions more as a trait-tag than embodied contradiction). The final epiphany—"she had been the missing piece all along"—arrives without sufficient embodied cost or micro-choices that foreclose paths; the realization feels declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Her sharp-eyed observation is consistent, but the character's internal conflict remains largely thematic rather than viscerally contradictory in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maren's guilt is established but never dramatized through on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her embodied emotion defaults to generic ache and trembling rather than character-specific physicality. The climactic memory of her father's death and her mother's payment arrives as exposition, not a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("manufactured false memories," "guilt a constant companion") that flattens rather than particularizes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The negotiator's interiority is present but often abstract—"uncommonly thoughtful" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to drop the drawer pull carries symbolic weight but feels more thematic than driven by embodied internal conflict. His professional expertise and moon-phase methodology are mentioned but don't constrain the pivotal decision. Emotional embodiment is thin: we're told about sleepless nights and exhaustion but don't see those states degrade perception or complicate the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interior contradiction—clinging to the stubborn hope while carrying collapsed expectations—is embodied through her kayaking motions and the compass pressed against her skin. The renunciation of Maren and withdrawal from friends feels somewhat told rather than dramatized in the present stakes, though it establishes credible regret. The final laugh and course adjustment demonstrate agency under pressure with visible cost (enduring broken vision, choosing movement over stillness). Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated reflection on "aligning heart and action," which borders on therapeutic label-speak but remains grounded in the physical act of paddling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation to kindle empathy is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final beat attempts an earned shift ("empathy to kindle not from remembered guilt but from present wonder"), yet the interior work leading there feels explained rather than lived—we're told she "understood" and "realized" without micro-choices that test commitment. The baseball's warmth and the traveler's presence trigger recognition, but Vera's agency remains observational; no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodiment is stronger in the opening ("weight of unremembered sins pressing against her ribs"), but emotional progression tilts toward summary and diagnostic phrasing ("cynicism...meeting awe") in the closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lysara's motivation is clear and her transformation arc is legible, but her interior voice relies heavily on abstract, elevated declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to transform feels announced rather than wrestled with in real time; "she was afraid, and she was ready" summarizes rather than dramatizes ambivalence. Korin remains a symbol rather than a person who might complicate her choice. The reflection-heavy design meets BRR exceptions but flattens moment-to-moment agency.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's motivation crystallizes clearly through concrete details (the saucer, the tablecloth ritual), and the final physical act—cutting her palm—embodies her internal shift. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract constructs ("guilt that had calcified," "forgiveness she had not known to seek") that function more as poetic declarations than embodied contradiction. The choice to cut herself feels somewhat unmotivated by prior causality; we see her hold the saucer but the leap to self-harm lacks intermediate tactical pressure that would make it inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraph's pacifist conviction is established early and her choice to preserve it despite past cost shows internal consistency. The gravitational-lightness trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her emotional states are often labeled ("happiness—real happiness") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final action of stepping through the dimension feels more like following instructions than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and summative reflection ("transformation's texture," "prophecy the way she understood her own heartbeat") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The philanthropist label functions as backstory decoration without on-page choices that test her values or reveal internal conflict. The final paragraph moves toward diagnostic label-speak ("destitute and luminous, purposeless and prowling") that abstracts state instead of dramatizing cost. No on-page decision forecloses a path with visible price; the ending recounts understanding rather than enacting change.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's "calmly inventive" trait appears as label-only through most of the story, told rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or embodied tension. Her discovery sequence reads mechanically—she traces, she recognizes, she withdraws the quill—without internal conflict or genuine struggle that would reveal character under pressure. The ending choice to transmit a message lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page; her motivation crystallizes with "perfect clarity" in a way that flattens rather than complicates her stance. Micro-choices are present but feel procedural rather than revealing a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's interior arc—precognitive visions that previously showed unchangeable endings now transform into connection rather than capture—is cleanly motivated and embodied through her decade-long ritual and her grandmother's lingering promise. The shift from "catching" to "joining" earns the final stance through accumulated pressure and lived particulars. Minor weakness: the precognitive curse is told rather than shown constraining an earlier choice with visible cost, reducing its integration into her decision-making under pressure. The embodied particulars (bare feet on frictionless stone, hands in water) anchor the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority is established through embodied details (palm against railing, darkroom timer) and her history as a censored poet creates clear stakes. However, her decision arc feels too smooth—she moves from "stopped running" to reading aloud to writing new verses without meaningful internal contradiction acting simultaneously. The final choice lacks visible cost; she simply realizes she was "holding it in suspension all along," which reads as epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses options. The "furiously tranquil" paradox is asserted more than dramatized through competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Varn's interiority reads as abstraction rather than embodied pressure: "turning questions into destinations" and "conflict into illumination" are philosophical labels, not contradictory impulses acting in scene. The younger scholar remains a convenience antagonist with no internality—his "desperate intensity" and "absolute certainty" are told traits. The mechanical arm backstory ("three years past," "limitation could become advantage") is summary-only reflection that does not anchor in present stimuli or tilt a present choice. Varn's final action—redirecting momentum with "superior understanding"—is asserted, not dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority shows concrete particulars (the coffee tin pressed "like a second heart," the lunar personality shifts), and her choice to share the hidden poems demonstrates vulnerability under pressure. Delphine's fingers lingering on spines and her concert-pianist revelation ground her presence. However, the personality-molting trait remains label-only—it's told as backstory but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible friction in this single evening. The emotional progression feels somewhat tidy; two strangers achieve deep intimacy without meaningful resistance or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—grief over Clara's loss—and the final choice (playing the piece she requested) carries emotional weight. However, the decisive act feels more symbolic than genuinely costly; we don't see what he forecloses by staying in this liminal space or what playing this encore changes about his stance toward grief. Internal contradiction is minimal: he's consistently melancholic and stuck, with no impulses pulling him toward reengagement with the living world. The embodied emotion is strongest in the opening tactile details (palms on keys, the broken clock) but thins during the arbor sequence, which reads more as atmospheric catalogue than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's occupation and motivation are clear, but her interior life remains abstract—she carries "weight of her people's dispersed memories" without embodied contradiction or struggle. The climactic moment when she "understood something that her instruments could never have measured" reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through on-page friction. The shift from skeptic to trust happens off-camera; we see no competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene, only summary of emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's interior life is rendered through concrete objects (compass, lace, bonsai tools) and his slow grief feels embodied in his actions. The emotional progression from unspoken apologies to forgiveness follows a credible arc, though the final insight ("The color of unspoken apologies... was never truly blue") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than pure dramatization. Internal contradiction is present—he both seeks and resists understanding—but the stakes remain largely reflective rather than forcing a difficult choice with visible cost. The severance backstory anchors the present effectively, though Elias remains a shadow rather than a pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's scientific interiority and contradictory struggle with gentle decay are concretely embodied; her final renunciation of dramatic narratives is earned by the butterfly's death and the dust pattern, with visible cost in the lingering "golden fingerprint" on her consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's characterization is concrete and driven by a clear, transforming motivation (survival to understanding). Her glass artist background filters perception credibly, and her adaptive trait is shown through embodied action (reading frost). The final choice (becoming pursuer) is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt as a "loosening of grief" and a foreclosed path of mere hiding. Minor deduction: the epiphany moment ("she understood finally") leans slightly toward summary, though it's anchored in the preceding pattern work.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's characterization is consistent and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in her grandmother's legacy, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, preventing a higher score. Her gentle persistence is shown through actions like midnight runs and bell ringing, and the final choice is earned with visible cost in the community's endurance. Relationships with Mariem and Farouk add depth, but internal conflict is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is vividly drawn with a consistent, reverent worldview, but lacks internal contradiction or a difficult choice that carries visible cost. Her final reflection is thematic rather than a character-driven change, and the absence of contradictory impulses limits depth.

    Maya’s phobia and stunt-double history create concrete interiority; her final choice to decrypt the notes and confront Daniel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in trembling certainty. The adaptive trait and betrayal force a credible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and motivation clear, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, smile beneath hood). The final choice—drawing the map—is earned by a lifetime of training and prophecy, carrying the cost of her dedication. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which limits the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit 7-Kappa's interiority is concrete and character-particular, blending mechanical precision with emergent curiosity. The motivation to understand thought's origin is dramatized through micro-choices (returning to the violin, playing). The final acceptance of flow as self is earned by prior causality (looped timelines, contemplation) with a felt cost—the dissolution of continuous identity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrator's interiority is concrete and motivation clear; micro-choices under pressure reveal values. Final choice to engage is earned, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized in scene.

    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., redirecting investors, polishing marbles) revealing a consistent, pragmatic hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marcus's characterization is concrete and contradictory: his reckless anticipation battles his religious skepticism under pressure, culminating in an earned confession. Interiority is embodied (e.g., "drowsy alertness settling over his mind like a warm blanket") and his final choice—to speak his truth—is motivated by the accumulated weight of the ghost shift and the radio confessions, with visible cost in his vulnerability. The single POV's emotional progression from rational dismissal to acceptance feels realistic and specific.

    Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied, rooted in the keepsake and her professional philosophy. Her micro-choices (reading faces, adjusting her approach, sitting in silence) reveal a consistent, patient hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though some phrasing ("cautious exuberance") edges toward thematic statement rather than raw perception.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)

    Matthias's characterization is precise and motive-driven, with clear micro-choices (adjusting the pedal, lifting the palette) and a consistent worldview. Interiority is concrete but occasionally tilts toward philosophical abstraction ("the essential fact of presence itself") which slightly distances embodied emotion. His clinical precision and renunciation of traditional tools (bells, candles) are earned and charge the final choice. No secondary on-page character to evaluate relationships.

    Elira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with temporal displacement syndrome driving her micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's gravity-defying curse and desire for integration are concretely embodied; her final choice to become the one who drops the ripple is earned by the painful journey through fractures, with visible cost in the darkening brightness and acceptance of fragmentation.

    Maren's interiority is concrete and her emotional numbness is embodied ("cold stone," "gray emptiness"). Her micro-choices under pressure (winding the crank, placing her palm) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The final stance—endurance and reconfiguration—is earned by the causality of the backward songs.

The closure choice (speaking the unspoken) is earned by the journey and the station's magic, with visible cost in the released words and the quieted trembling. Minor deduction for some told emotional states ("heart hammering with fear") that slightly reduce embodiment at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren's characterization is strong with clear motives rooted in defiance; her "charming rogue scholar" persona is demonstrated through actions like planting the seed and smiling at the drone.

The final choice to plant the seed is earned and reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Character is consistent and motivated; interiority is concrete with embodied longing. The final endurance (continuing to write) is earned by prior causality and the cost of centuries is felt. However, the poet is more archetypal than individually contradictory, limiting the highest band.

    The caretaker’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a poignant, foxglove-regret love for preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)

Interiority is concrete via tactile details (feeling glyphs, the ink well's pulse).

    Maruk’s frugality and thoroughness are consistent, concrete traits that compel his discovery and final ritual. His motivation intensifies credibly from scholarly curiosity to urgent, covenant-renewing agency under the pressure of the regime change.

A slight deduction because his emotional interiority, while present, leans slightly toward diagnostic summary in the "empirical irony" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions (bewilderment vs. duty) acting simultaneously. Her final inquiry and the resulting "brightened disquiet" are earned by prior causality—the inherited cameo and her grandmother's inscription—and carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation (renegotiate the broken bargain) is clear and rooted in her expertise, intensifying as she deciphers absences. Interiority is concrete via the botanical diary and her methodological shift, though on-page micro-choices under pressure are limited to observation and translation rather than decisive action.

The final choice to step into the fog is an Earned Stasis that forecloses passive drifting, charged by the memory-alteration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with "preemptively nostalgic" grounding her method. Micro-choice to record with the summer-quill reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira's interior contradiction is embodied in the "second skin" paradox and her micro-choices (climbing, placing the doll, pressing it to her heart) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied ("her own clock had stopped"), with contradictory impulses ("uncertainly certain") shown through her meticulous planning versus acceptance of intervention.

The micro-choice to use kintsugi—not merely repair—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's characterization is deep and motivated, with embodied emotion and clear micro-choices. Her final stance of tired hope is earned by her backstory and the on-page interaction with the soldier.

    Interiority is concrete and embodied (copper taste, proprioceptive wrongness). Motivation (mathematics of mercy) intensifies and compels her choice to stop at the clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Protagonist’s interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion; the final choice to wear the fragment is earned by prior causality (grandmother’s gift, years of carrying, alchemist’s revelation) and carries visible cost in accepting the legacy. Minor deduction for relatively smooth internal conflict, but contradictory impulses are present in the shift from passive keeper to active bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cassian's motivation is clear and rooted in a lifetime of covenant work, with concrete interiority (the weight of the stone, memory of his master).

The final choice is earned by prior causality but the cost is more conceptual than personally felt.

    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with interiority concrete and character-particular. Her final renunciation—understanding she will not return—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, as she realizes the lagoon is beyond capture.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Miriam's motivation is clear and rooted in her archival work and personal history, with embodied emotion ("reverie tightening around her heart"). Her micro-choices under pressure—deciphering, descending, kneeling—reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in micro-choices, but interior contradiction is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, slightly limiting depth. Final renunciation of magic is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation and "furiously tranquil" nature are clear and embodied, driving the ritual with consistent micro-choices. However, contradictory impulses do not actively clash in scene, limiting interior complexity.

    Strong concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses in scene, capping at 8.8 per 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cosmic janitor’s spiritually curious nature is embodied through concrete, reverent actions, and the final handling of the star fragment reveals a clear hierarchy of values. However, the characterization lacks interior contradiction or a dynamic struggle; the POV is consistently serene and wise, missing the flawed, contradictory impulses that would elevate the score. The closure choice—gentle witnessing—feels inherent rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final acceptance of the covenant is earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible in the "crushing weight" of the box, though her passivity limits contradictory impulses.

Final renunciation is earned but without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)

No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. wonder) is concretely embodied in her actions and observations. Her final recognition—that the artificial pilgrimage has become genuine—is earned by prior micro-choices (e.g., obtaining the amber, climbing the path). The cost of her transformed stance is visible as she descends "no longer the same being." A slight deduction for moments of abstract, diagnostic interiority (e.g., "The chemistry of homecoming intrigued her deeply").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coachman is a coherent, archetypal figure with clear motivation and embodied presence. However, interior contradiction is absent; he is a steadfast mediator without internal conflict, which limits psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)

The emotional progression from aloof suspension to the "itch" of greeting an old friend is realistic and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)

No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary weakens the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular (weariness, weight of crown). The final choice/renunciation (to embrace a renewed purpose) is earned by the climb and the grotto's revelation, with the cost being the shedding of her disenchanted identity. A slight weakness: the shift from weariness to reborn wonder at the climax feels slightly rapid, though anchored in the prior dreams and the firefly exhale moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and her transformation from seeking extraction to embracing acknowledgment is earned through on-page reflection and interaction. The relationship with Sera serves as a crucible, prompting the shared secret that crystallizes the change.

Interiority is concrete (trembling hands, crystallizing tears) and the contradiction between scholarly cynicism and inherited belief acts simultaneously. The final renunciation of force in favor of intuition is earned by the flashback and self-acceptance beat. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic label-speak ("The crystals were not a curse...") in an otherwise embodied peak.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor's motivation and interiority are concrete and compelling, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her apology is a decisive, earned change that forecloses a path with felt cost. Margot is equally well-drawn, and their relationship acts as a crucible. The "gossip-column exorcist" detail enriches character but does not directly drive closure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara's role as witness provides a clear motivation (to observe/resolve endings), but interiority remains abstract; her "wanderingly exact" ritual is a micro-choice that reveals values, yet contradictory impulses and embodied emotion under pressure are not deeply dramatized. The character serves the concept more than exhibiting flawed, particular humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aira’s interiority is concrete and her motivation—to understand time’s true nature—is clear and consistent, compelling her patient endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and her realization about "the physics of letting go" is earned through the specific, pressured geometry of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exceptional: the logistician's contradictory impulses (jocular defense vs. profound loneliness) act in scene, and the final choice to stay and ask for remembrance is earned by a cascading realization of their own avoided need.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina's internal contradiction—practicing inherited signs yet feeling she doesn't understand—acts in scene. Her final, unplanned signing to Elena is a decisive choice earned by prior causality (grief, practice, the old man's guidance) with visible cost in Elena's crying and her own "joyful sorrow." Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, rooted in a principled defiance that evolves from destructive arson to dedicated preservation. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (e.g., touching book spines, feeling the tapestry's pull).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eleanor’s patient, revolutionary character is consistent and her motivation to plant doubt is clear, though rendered through summary more than on-page micro-choices under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation evolves credibly from professional task to deeper yearning for "the texture of connection." Embodied habits (holding the lens to her ear) and micro-choices under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira's characterization is precise and embodied, her "softly deliberate" nature filtering through every action. The river stone and memory gaps create interior contradiction, and her final vigil is an earned endurance.

The shift from striving to listening feels inevitable and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira's resolve is clear and consistent; her refusal of the merchant and declaration "I cultivate the sparks" reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)

Interiority is concrete and contradictory ("becoming less scattered even as she became less whole"). The final renunciation is earned, with visible cost in her fragmented selfhood pouring into the Heart-Tree.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's isolation and variant allegiance are embodied through concrete micro-choices (pressing ear, cracked smile, walking to the portico) and a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren's "brightly attentive" trait is consistently shown through her pattern recognition and investigation, motivating her final choice to trace the deleted files.

Minor: ghost is passive, but this serves the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara's curiosity and functional creativity are clear and consistent, motivating her exploration and plan.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is concretely realized through patient observation and tactile handling of objects, his philosophical nature embodied rather than stated. His final choice (to plant and weave) is earned by decades of study and the on-page decoding act. The "infinitely patient" trait constrains his method, visible in his careful examination. A minor deduction for a slightly abstract interior moment ("the particular quiet of a world between states") that briefly edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character's profession and internal conflict ("writing obituaries for the living") are concrete and drive the scene. Interiority is strong and embodied (touching the thread, the "reverence of farewells"). The final choice to stay is a credible Earned Stasis, motivated by her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her motivation to understand collective grief is clear, rooted in her relationship with her grandmother. Her "fiercely meditative" focus and micro-choices (leaving tools, reading poems, speaking aloud) reveal character under pressure.

A slight telling in the epiphany ("She understood now...") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("holding it I feel the weight of someone else's obsessions").

The relationship with Mira feels authentic and serves as a crucible for Elara's realization. The final choice to climb the tower and speak the riddle is motivated by her character-specific blend of duty and emerging hope. The emotional progression from doubt to conviction is embodied, though the epiphany about "wonder draining from the city's routine" edges toward diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied ("a detail so mundane it humiliates the gravity of survival"). The final stance of "bleak exhilaration" is an Earned Stasis rooted in established causality—his analytical hunt is a direct, character-specific response to unimaginable loss. The hierarchy of values (search over closure) is revealed through micro-choices under pressure, like holding the geode to the light. A minor deduction for a moment of slightly diagnostic language ("perturbation theory applied to existential crisis"), though it's quickly grounded in character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)

    Mira's characterization is deep with embodied contradiction like "furiously tranquil." Her final realization is earned by prior causality, showing cost in years of silence. No stock phrasing; interiority is concrete and character-particular, and micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Varn's motivation and interiority are concrete, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; the mechanical arm as a constraint and his philosophical stance are well-integrated. The younger scholar serves as a foil, but Varn's resolution is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the opponent's defeated certainty. No contradictory impulses in scene slightly limits the peak, but characterization remains strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira and Delphine are vividly realized through concrete interiority and embodied emotions; their sharing of secrets feels earned, with micro-choices revealing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied through specific actions (frozen clock, film-reel study). Motivation to "surprise fate" compels the final high-stakes choice. A minor inconsistency exists in the backstory of Clara's death (sudden disappearance vs. diagnosed illness), but this does not materially undermine the earned renunciation/endurance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to the ridge and the seed's awakening, but interior contradiction is understated; her competence and resolve are evident, yet the final renunciation (trust over verification) is earned by the on-page dream and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is deep and embodied, with Marek's interiority and patient nature consistently shown through action (waiting for wind to dry hands, bonsai work). The final choice—to shape the tree and release the need for answers—is an Earned Stasis foreclosing a path with visible cost. The sole minor weakness is the near-diagnostic label "cerulean regret," though it is quickly embodied in specific images, preventing a major deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply defined through her professional history, preference for “elegant violence,” and her resistance to slow, humble processes, and this character logic cleanly motivates her internal shift. Her scientific framing of everything, including the butterfly, gives her a distinctive interiority. The tension between trained detachment and the emotional impact of the butterfly’s death is credible and sustained. The final repricing of her own habits feels earned, though it veers a touch toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and textured, grounded in her history with glass and the fire, and her shift from victim to pursuer feels earned. Her motivation moves credibly from fear and grief to curiosity and moral resolve, with micro-choices like studying frost patterns and deciding to leave the canyon. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. new purpose, sanctuary vs. pursuit) are present, though they could be dramatized in a slightly sharper moment of hesitation. Overall, she reads as a distinct, embodied individual rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and tied to concrete habits (her careful movement, the tuning fork, her methodology), and her interiority is rendered through sensory and professional focus rather than abstract labels. The survivor detail and bodily wariness add texture, but her internal conflict remains fairly gentle—hesitation about the hall rather than a charged contradiction of impulses. The final realization (“she realized now that she had succeeded”) is a touch on-the-nose and softens the sense of hard-won change. Overall she reads as particular and coherent, but not yet pushed into a truly fraught moral or emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aldric is sharply etched as a weary, old-school undertaker with a palpable ache and vocation, and his professionalism colors how he meets the supernatural call. His choices (opening the box, accepting the souls’ needs, deciding to wait by the window) are motivated and coherent. However, his internal conflict is underplayed—he moves from fatigue to acceptance with little visible resistance or contradictory impulse on the page, which keeps his change from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is clearly motivated, with leadership emerging organically from whispered requests and anonymous aid; her “gently persistent” nature is embodied in both her past food runs and present bell-ringing. Interiority is specific enough to feel lived (the border memory, the “grief of proximity”), and reactions to objects (bell, arbor) reveal character rather than generic sentiment. However, she verges on flawless—there’s little on-page contradiction or cost to her virtue, which slightly flattens her under pressure. The brief interactions with Mariem and Farouk hint at rich relationships but don’t yet function as crucibles that force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s vocation, sensibility, and pull toward the viaduct are clearly motivated and particular, with strong embodied touches (the salt on her tongue, the trembling hands). Her role as “pilgrim of sparks” gives her a distinctive psychology rather than a stock mystic. However, internal contradiction is light—she moves from recognition to execution with little visible friction or doubt—so the final act feels more like fulfillment than a pressured choice with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid, particular, and consistently filtered through her training and obsessions, from “gardens were not merely arranged spaces but arguments” to her realization about time’s “fibrous moments.” Her motivation—to understand and complete her grandfather’s temporal horticulture—is clear and organically intensifies as the photographs begin showing future images. The final decision to “design a maze that could trap not just moments but the texture of time itself” is well-earned by prior thought and perception, with a credible emotional cost in the responsibility she assumes. The only limitation is that conflicting impulses (e.g., fear vs. duty vs. grief) are more implied than dramatized in on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s core motive—preserving what the regime wants to erase—is clear, consistent, and grounded in concrete choices like spending three years decoding the bench and delaying any planting until after surveillance resets. Her competence and patience feel particular rather than generic, and the chained disguise nicely externalizes her liminal status. However, she faces little on-page dilemma or contradictory impulse; she rarely wavers, so internal conflict and embodied emotion stay at a relatively cool, conceptual register. The final stance (keeper of futures, delaying action) is earned but carries only a muted, mostly implied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and tethered to concrete history (her synesthesia, career, and relationship with David), and her core motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is consistently embodied in her present choices. The David backstory is efficiently used to reweight her current work rather than feeling expositional. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she intellectually knows there may be no “market,” yet persists out of a personal, almost irrational need. The quiet endurance at the end (returning to work) reads as an earned stasis rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, worldview, and habits are clearly and consistently motivated, and the man with the camellias, while sketched briefly, feels legible in his weariness and half-awareness. The interiority is specific to her mythic, aesthetic way of seeing (“moments chose their observers”), which keeps her from feeling generic. However, her internal conflict is minimal—there’s no real contradictory impulse or hard trade-off on the page. The ending crystallizes her enduring stance more than it alters it, which keeps the character work solid but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glassblower’s interiority is rich and particular, with his relationship to molten glass, the bookmark, and the thaw presenting a coherent psychology. His motivation—to build “safe zones for inquiry” and to slowly unfreeze his own guardedness—feels organically tied to his craft. However, most of the conflict is reflective rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured choices, so we don’t see his contradictions tested in a specific moment. The final stance (preparing “to begin again”) is emotionally credible but carries a relatively gentle, low-cost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s interiority is specific and layered—stunt competence vs claustrophobia, performative bravery vs deep fear—and those contradictions are active in the scene. Her choice to stay, decode, and claim identity in the face of both phobia and betrayal feels motivated by what we’ve learned. Daniel as mentor-turned-betrayer is clear, if somewhat archetypal, but the dynamic still functions as a strong crucible. The one softness is how quickly she reaches meta-level self-understanding (“adaptive nature… survival mechanism honed over lifetimes”), which feels slightly too tidy and articulate under acute stress.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s motivation—finish the map before the final darkness—feels clear and consistent, and her lifelong apprenticeship with stones personalizes her. However, her interiority remains almost entirely aligned with her purpose, with little on-page contradiction or ambivalence, which flattens potential complexity. Emotion is more described than embodied, especially around her death beat, which lands as serene rather than hard-won. The final renunciation (allowing herself to die once the work is done) is credible but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Unit 7-Kappa’s motivation—to probe the origin and continuity of its own thoughts—is clear and specific, and its curiosity about the violin feels organic to that drive. The interiority is rich and character-particular for a robot, especially the recursive self-awareness and sense of being “reconstructed” across loops. However, internal conflict is more thematic than dramatized; we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses in-scene, just a calm, steady contemplation, which softens the felt cost of its final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is well-realized: the inherited lens, the commitment to “presence” as work, and the choice to stay when others leave all feel specific and motivated. His responses to Mira—recognizing her symbol, offering his own ticket, accepting her touch—track cleanly with his values. Internal contradiction (yearning for connection vs. fear or doubt) is more implied than dramatized, so the emotional stakes never quite bite as hard as they could. Mira is evocative but sketched mainly through the narrator’s projections rather than her own conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply etched: the “withered vine dresser” whose stubborn patience, pragmatism, and sentiment toward cracked marbles feel character-specific and embodied. Her deception of the investors and her ritual polishing dramatize her values without resorting to therapy-speak. However, the piece largely affirms an already-stable stance rather than pressing her into a new, costly choice on the page, so the internal arc resolves as a quiet endurance rather than a charged turn. The lack of in-scene pressure keeps this just shy of truly standout characterization for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira is clearly motivated—to prove her sideways-time hypothesis and to transcend her past as “an obliging sky mechanic”—and her competence feels grounded in concrete habits and tools. However, internal conflict is minimal: she never seriously doubts, risks, or wants something that cuts against her goal, so the discovery comes a bit too smoothly. The line “This felt different—this was proving something fundamental...” gestures toward deeper stakes but isn’t really tested. Her change at the end is more validated than earned through struggle, which limits the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s motives—to stay, decode Marco’s message, and play—are clear and consistent, with the flood and the uncanny program pressing on her choices. Her identity as a long-time pit musician and Marco’s partner in music gives her a specific, credible lens. However, internal contradiction is muted: once she decides to read the flood as revelation, very little genuine resistance or confusion complicates her path. The final acceptance feels earned but emotionally smooth, with limited sense of cost beyond a quiet spiritual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s guilt, competence, and fragility are rendered with concrete interiority (the “fault tolerance as an oracle” frame, the stone-weight of truth) and her final stance—choosing to warn the valley after accepting that Elena likely forgave her—feels earned. Contradictory impulses (paralyzing fear vs professional duty) coexist in scene rather than alternating in summary. The relationship with Elena is fully alive despite Elena’s absence, and her memory exerts real pressure on Mira’s choices. The only minor softness is how cleanly the forgiveness insight arrives; it borders on tidiness without quite tipping into it.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s recklessness, skepticism, and draw toward liminal spaces are clearly established and consistently drive his choices, from dropping into the tunnel to staying with the uncanny experience. The internal contradiction—skeptic who’s nevertheless susceptible to the ghost shift’s pull—is well-handled and feels character-specific. His final move toward confession is psychologically motivated by the radio voices and his realization about shared burdens, even if the precise content of his secret is withheld. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is specific and consistent—someone who “gripped reality loosely” and sees knowledge as seasonal compost feels like a distinct consciousness. Motivation (to witness without intervening) is clear and coheres with every choice, but there’s little on-page pressure to stress or complicate that stance. The closest to tension is the discovery of “regenerative silence,” yet the keeper accepts it with no visible friction or cost. As a result, characterization is rich but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply drawn—her vocation, maternal history, and philosophy of “preservation of wonder” cohere and drive her choices in the scene. Her mellow, attentive style is dramatized via micro-choices (choosing silence after the song, reading the children’s faces, letting wonder arise rather than forcing it). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (her ache and protective impulse vs. her refusal to “fix” them), so the arc feels more like deepening than transformation. Maya’s brief but meaningful gesture at the end gives the relationship a small, earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated—his purpose to “collect the stories walls had heard” is specific and consistent, and his oddness and sensitivity give him texture. However, he doesn’t face a sharp internal contradiction or moral dilemma; his stance never comes under real pressure. The closing shift to “renewed urgency” is an evolution rather than a costly change, so the arc feels more deepened than transformed. Strong interior specificity (his attunement to ash, walls, tapestry) keeps him from reading generic, but the lack of on-page conflict limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched: the ex-intelligence officer whose habits, precision, and trust in “flow” carry over into his new vocation, with specific, lived details (microdot specs, supply lists, folded wrappers). His motives—to withdraw from the old game while still decoding and directing meaning—are clear and consistent. Internal conflict around the letter and "Some journeys end where they began" is present but understated rather than dramatized in a high-pressure moment. The piece stops short of fully staging contradictory impulses in scene, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Father Matthias is sharply etched—a scholar-priest whose vocation is interrogation rather than ritual—and his motives (to probe thresholds, renegotiate hidden contracts) are consistent and specific. Interiority is rich and concrete (“examined the single color that remained…before understanding that its singular presence was the point”), with actions aligning to his worldview. However, he’s almost entirely confident and unified; we get little live contradiction or visible internal cost, and Gabriel remains an offstage stake rather than a character, which limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s interiority is rich and particular—the chronologically homesick oracle who pays a cost for her gift is strongly etched. Her motivation to complete one last prophecy before mental fragmentation is clear and consistent. However, she faces little on-page contradiction or dilemma; she never seriously wavers or chooses between competing values, which limits the depth of change. The final act reads as fulfillment of a pre-decided duty rather than a pressured, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to integrate her fractured selves and reclaim agency over her periodically eternal state—is clear and coherent with her actions. The interiority is thoughtful and specific to her relationship with time and gravity, though it leans conceptual rather than bodily or behaviorally grounded. We get limited contradiction or messy emotional layering under pressure; her determination is largely stable throughout. The cost of her nature is articulated, but not deeply dramatized in a concrete, scene-level reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s motivation is precise and compelling—“to defeat emotional numbness” gives a clean spine to every choice, from the journey to her willingness to experiment. Her interiority is concrete and particular (numbness “settled into her bones like cold stone,” the hush as membrane), and her shift from passive to active presence feels earned. However, her transformation is slightly too smooth; she encounters little resistance or contradiction beyond the initial numbness, which keeps the arc from feeling fully pressure-tested. Koren is effective as a catalytic presence but remains thinly sketched as a person.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s characterization is specific and coherent: the meticulous storm recorder, the solitary ethicist, the observer who finally chooses to act. Her professional habits and moral stance clearly motivate both why she’s targeted and why she refuses to hide. What’s missing for a higher score is any genuine internal contradiction at the peak—she feels concern but not a deep, dramatized tug-of-war between self-preservation and exposure. The “integrity in isolation” idea is strong but slightly over-explained rather than revealed through conflicted behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mirabel’s interiority is specific—her “aromatically cautious” approach to the vial and her accumulated habits as a lantern broker feel grounded in a long, particular life. Her emotional turn from guardedness to fully grieving her brother is credible and causally earned by the flower’s revelation. However, her conflict is largely one-way—she rarely feels truly torn on the page, and contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear, duty vs. avoidance) are more stated than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The relationship with her brother is powerful but mostly reconstructed through exposition rather than being pressured in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions are clear and particular: her need to understand, to remain ethically playful, and to both witness and join the transformation all pull against each other in the present moment. Her history with the prison and the rope grounds those drives in embodied experience rather than abstraction. The final choice—to remain on the threshold by recommitting to the pattern—is credibly earned from these traits and carries a felt cost (forgoing immediate transcendence). A minor limitation is that some emotional states are described conceptually rather than fully embodied, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s motive—to unbind something in the ruined land and to “find beauty in the unfinished”—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her family history and profession. Her interiority feels embodied in how she registers silence, ash, and faint echoes rather than via labels. The emotional contradiction (grieving what’s gone while insisting on playing for what might return) is present but could be sharpened further in on-page moments of doubt or temptation to give up. The final endurance choice (she plays through the hush and accepts a partial, fragile answer) feels earned and carries a credible cost scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s profession, worldview, and habits are sharply etched, and her motives (to perfect an empathy compound, to test on herself first) are coherent and specific. Interiority is rich and embodied—“static electricity…like tiny electric admissions,” “rearranged the furniture of her interior world”—and clearly character-particular. The main limitation is that her conflict is largely philosophical; we see little in-the-moment struggle or contradictory impulse beyond an abstracted “affectionate detachment,” so her final realization feels like a deepening rather than a pressured turn. The cost of her work to her selfhood is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is sharply etched through her occupational lens and habit of noticing, and the tug between her “cargo broker instincts” and her grandmother’s voice gives her a credible micro-conflict. Her choice to pursue the envelope feels motivated by character rather than plot need. Elias is sketched with less depth but still registers as specific—a lifetime of marginal work embodied in his trembling over the recovered photograph. The main limitation is the relatively low intensity of internal contradiction; she doesn’t truly risk much by following her better impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Yara’s longing for community and history of over-giving are clear, specific, and drive every choice from carrying the reeds to kneeling at the arbor. The flashback to villages “that had learned to forget her name” credibly motivates her guardedness and the risk inherent in deciding to stay and ask to receive. The realization about her past pattern—“she had never asked to receive, only to give”—is earned by what we’ve seen rather than a bolt from nowhere. The one limitation is that her contradictory impulses in the present (urge to help vs fear of being drained again) are more told than dramatized in a concrete, in-scene dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sera’s vocation, heritage, and sensitivity to the city’s silences create a clear, specific character with coherent motivation, and her micro-choices (following the canals, using the pendant) track cleanly from that base. However, there’s little on-page internal conflict or ambivalence—once she “understood…what she must do,” the path feels emotionally unopposed, which flattens complexity. Her fear, doubt, or selfish impulses never meaningfully contest her sense of duty. The final endurance—staying until dawn—reads more as procedure than a charged sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conjurer’s interiority is specific and textured—her methodical, pattern-focused mindset and quiet grief feel lived rather than generic. Motivation (to understand ambiguous loss via “mathematics of emotion”) is clear and consistent, and her final choice to leave the eyes reads as an earned stance shift rather than an unearned epiphany. The key inner contradiction—her compulsion to quantify emotion versus the dawning acceptance that it may not be solvable—is credible but could be pushed slightly harder in moment-to-moment micro-choices. She remains a little archetypal (we learn almost nothing of her life beyond this cavern), which holds the piece just shy of truly exceptional characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren is specific and memorable: the “crawl space dwelling” caretaker whose attention to unseen systems maps cleanly onto how she loves. Her motivation and temperament (“kindly methodical”) are consistently dramatized in choices like stopping to investigate the glint. However, her inner life is almost entirely aligned—there’s little contradiction or real friction, so her final stance feels like an extension of what we already know rather than a pressured shift. The emotional cost of her calling is only lightly implied, not really tested.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete behaviors (the way she handles the leaf, her scientific precision, her resistance to “transplant shock” in her own life). Her contradiction—clinging to rootedness while studying adaptive growth—is clear and drives the final choice to call Sarah. The relationship with Sarah is mostly off-page but still exerts real pressure, and the phone call credibly forecloses her old avoidance pattern. Emotional states feel embodied and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s exhaustion, skill, and drive come through clearly, and her willingness to trade the heirloom brooch for the telescope is a well-motivated, revealing choice. The insomniac state is embodied (“hands still trembled,” “eyes had developed the habit of seeing double”) and her painter’s sensibility colors perception. Internal contradiction (need to keep going vs. need to rest, attachment to the brooch vs. need for the tool) is present but lightly sketched rather than fully dramatized in-scene. The stranger is vivid in a few strokes but functions more as catalyst than as a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Varen’s arrogance and certainty are cleanly established (“the future was a country he had already visited”) and his crack of doubt at the pearls feels organic. His inner shift from seer-as-conqueror to listener is well motivated by accumulated cave experience rather than a single cheap epiphany. However, most of his struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in specific moment-to-moment choices under pressure, so his nine days in the cave read as a graceful montage more than a crucible. The emotional cost of surrendering his old self-concept could be embodied more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist is clearly motivated by his drive to assemble meaning from fragments, and his interiority feels specific (the satchel-checking, the way visions affect him). However, he experiences little genuine internal contradiction or pressure; his decision to stay behind and his role in the return are more asserted than tested on the page. Sera functions more as a catalytic presence than a relational crucible, so status and emotional stakes between them stay relatively flat. The final realization about the valve is credible and earned but carries limited visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aria’s blend of meticulous rationality and latent vulnerability is clear and consistent, and her fear of losing her mentor versus her compulsion to follow the path creates a credible internal tension. The story earns her final admission of love and fear reasonably well, though the shift from lifelong silence to articulated confession happens very smoothly, with little visible resistance in the climax. Emotional states are mostly embodied (boots crunching, trembling chest), but sometimes drift into abstract labels like “trembling certainty.” The mentor remains more function than person, which slightly flattens the relational crucible that’s supposed to underlie her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply etched as a sympathetic skeptic whose habits (toolbox, journal, politeness with locals) all align with her stated worldview, and her shift toward wonder feels causally tied to her encounter with the tile. The internal contradiction—skepticism versus openness—is present and credibly maintained through the final line where skepticism “finds a companion in wonder.” Emotional embodiment leans a bit abstract at times (more described than viscerally felt), but never enough to break credibility. The final choice to contribute her own memories is earned and carries a quiet but legible cost to her prior self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian’s ennui, long history with the amulet, and finally reaching readiness are clear and consistent, and his immortal boredom is convincingly tied to his desire for a different kind of knowledge. However, his inner conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure; once the storm arrives he more or less does the one expected thing. The shift from “not ready for three millennia” to “ready now” is thematically justified by the spatial mutiny but still feels a touch convenient, with limited on-page struggle. Emotional embodiment skews conceptual—more thought and cosmic perception than felt, contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivations are coherent and specific—her obsession with “the mathematics of a fair trade” clearly arises from her con-artist upbringing and informs every major choice. Her internal contradiction (inherited analytical ruthlessness vs. moral refusal to deceive) is dramatized rather than merely stated. Darius is thinner but functional as a pressure source and moral test. The shift at the end toward “something like peace” feels earned by prior beats without reading as a pat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s worldview and vocation are sharply etched—her belief in frequencies as memory, her inherited craft, and her decision to stay when others leave all feel specific and grounded. However, she remains largely static; we see commitment but not much internal contradiction or change under pressure. Emotional states are more implied than dramatized in embodied conflict. The piece reads as a rich character sketch rather than a full arc with a visible costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    The nameless one has a clear, idiosyncratic motivation—mapping fragments into an alternate history shaped by their erroneous death—and their actions align with that drive throughout. Interiority is mostly conceptual rather than bodily, so emotional stakes are felt more at the level of idea than visceral contradiction. The death-certificate backstory gives them a credible wound that colors perception, but we rarely see real-time internal conflict or a hard choice dramatized. The endurance at the end (continuing unnamed, continuing to collect) feels earned but somewhat low-friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s skepticism and methodical worldview are clearly established and her internal shift toward accepting uncertainty feels motivated by the cello experience. Her emotional life, especially regret about “all the things left unsaid,” is sketched with enough specificity to feel personal, not generic. However, much of her reckoning is summarized (“Each time she touched the cello strings, she reimagined past conversations…”) rather than dramatized in concrete, embodied beats, which blunts the cost. The final acceptance comes slightly quickly, with less on-page struggle than a top-tier venue would likely demand.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s role, motives, and skillset are clear and specific—“culture shock absorber” and her use of the old language give her a distinct profile, and her tactics align well with those traits. The dual allegiance between investors and old-timers is explicitly dramatized in her choice to resist by organizing rather than lashing out. However, internal conflict is more stated than felt; she experiences little on-page wavering or irrationality under pressure. The cost she bears (“absorbed the weight of that responsibility”) is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, which softens the character arc’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply etched as professionally obsessive, reverent, and competent, with her habits and perceptions grounded in the specifics of crater inspection and Yusuf’s mentorship. Her motivation—to bear witness to vanishing frost—is clear and coherently linked to the sand grain and her methodical care. What’s missing at this level is real internal friction or contradictory impulses under pressure; she never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible personal price beyond a generalized melancholy. The resulting arc feels like dignified endurance rather than a fully pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific, competent, and motivated by a clear ethic of care; his blindness and tactile intelligence give him a distinct interior lens. However, he encounters little real resistance and almost no contradictory impulses, so we see skill and tenderness more than genuine struggle under pressure. The emotional beats are mostly summarized (“his heart full of care”) rather than enacted through conflicted micro-choices. The endurance at the end feels credible but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam’s vocation, habits, and quiet stubbornness are sharply drawn, and her motivation—to prove the convergence and map it—is clear and consistent. Interiority is concrete and particular (condensation-reading, falcon habits, archival respect) rather than generic. However, her emotional state under pressure is relatively one-note, and we don’t see a sharply dramatized internal contradiction or a difficult, costly choice on the page. The “change” at the end is more an affirmed belief than a tested shift, which limits the depth of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eliorn’s motivation is clear, specific, and deeply embedded in her profession and worldview, and her endurance under cost (aching legs, seasons of work) feels credible. The piece captures her vocation and patience vividly—“patience that transcended mortal waiting”—and her actions (the circuits, the counting of repetitions) all align with that. What’s thinner is internal contradiction: she seldom wavers, doubts, or reveals competing impulses, so the portrait risks feeling a touch single-note. A hint more friction within her—fear of failure, resentment at the burden—would move this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s motives—grief, inherited duty, curiosity stronger than self-preservation—are clear and consistent, and her embodied experience (burning lungs, hesitating thumb, the shift away from needing to breathe) tracks convincingly. The sacrifice at the end feels earned in terms of setup but is emotionally a bit too unresisted; there’s little on-page struggle between survival instinct and submission once the vial is opened. Her voice and perceptions feel individual enough, but some of the internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment thought. This slightly mutes the cost of her final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motives and inheritance are clear and specific, and the piece gives him a distinctive inner life rooted in shame, loyalty, and defiance. However, internal conflict mostly runs in a single direction (he is committed to story over silence) rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in-scene. His key choice—to come here and speak—is largely pre-decided before the narrative window, so we see ratification more than risky reconsideration.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (repaying the debt, nearing release) is clear and consistent, and her history with the alchemist gives her a distinct emotional contour, but we rarely feel active internal contradiction in the moment—she mostly enacts a settled purpose. The young gardener is sketched effectively but thinly, primarily as a vessel for inheritance rather than as an agent with competing drives. The key choice—Elara offering the “loving venom” to the scions and the gardener—is motivated and coherent, yet it feels more like the continuation of a ritual than a pressured decision. The cost of her long endurance is felt conceptually but not explored in embodied, scene-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motive—reviving path-stitching to guide people to water—is clear, consistent, and closely tied to her history as a weaver. Her interiority is particular (the way she reads ruins as material for reverence), but she experiences little real contradiction or doubt, which flattens potential complexity. Sleepwalking as “method” hints at divided states but isn’t mined for conflict beyond atmosphere. The final act of consecrating the spring feels earned, though the personal cost remains mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to understand her grandmother’s silence and her own heritage—is clear and consistent, and her actions (remaining after the team leaves, rebuilding the sundial, carrying it to the orchard) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied (“warmly curious despite her fatigue,” the weight of “centuries pressing down”), and she feels like an individual rather than a type. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely seems genuinely torn or under real emotional duress, so the final “homecoming that was also a departure” doesn’t feel costly enough. The arc lands as a believable deepening rather than a sharply earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is vivid, with a clear vocation, sensibility, and motive, and even Eleanor is sketched with specificity through her request. However, Maren faces almost no real internal contradiction or pressured choice; she proceeds steadily from intention to completion. Her emotions are more implied by aesthetic preference than embodied struggle. The final act (adding the postscript and mailing) feels consistent but not deeply costly or transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and core motive (to expose erased truths while appearing harmless) are sharply rendered, and her interior lens on politics feels specific and consistent. However, her emotional range remains narrow—preternaturally calm, with little visible fear or ambivalence despite looming coup stakes. The piece gestures at internal contradiction (wisdom vs. feigned foolishness) more than it dramatizes it under pressure. The ending offers an articulation of ongoing resolve rather than a new, costly shift in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s interiority is rich, specific, and believable, with a clear long-term wound (the sister, the unsent letter) that organizes her choices in the present scene. Her contradictory impulses—compulsion to return vs. dread and self-punishment—are well dramatized, especially when she recoils from the window’s message and then chooses to engage anyway. The self-forgiveness at the end feels earned by what we’ve seen of her history and temperament, not like a bolt-on epiphany. The only limitation is that the sister relationship is powerful but entirely offstage, so some emotional beats risk feeling slightly pre-digested rather than freshly conflicted in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira is sharply etched through occupation, bodily awareness, and her ethic of translation as witness; her decision to take on Fatima’s story while still anesthetized feels both consistent and costly. The 'shrewdly innocent' trait is not just labeled but borne out in how she reads the cast while clinging to hope that meaning can be recovered. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—pain and reluctance coexisting with professional reflex—so her arc is more modulation than turn. Secondary characters (Fatima, grandmother, Dr. Okonkwo) are sketched efficiently, though the emotional dynamic with Dr. Okonkwo remains largely functional rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motive (to recover a lost, authentic joy eroded by corporate work) is clear, grounded in specific history, and her emotional state is embodied in how she responds to the fog, the fragment, and the watching crowd. Her internal conflict is present but gentle—hollow efficiency versus vulnerable hope—rather than sharply dramatized as contradictory impulses in the moment. Secondary figures (the grandmother, the “knowledge network,” the old woman who names her grandmother) are lightly but effectively sketched as pressures toward continuation. The closing thaw in her chest and her pensive laughter feel earned by what has happened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is specific and credible as a long-practicing restorer whose “methodically playful” habits color how she encounters the garden and the coin. Her internal shift—from certainty about restoration to curiosity and conversation—is clearly motivated by accumulated sensory experience. However, there is little on-page resistance or contradiction in her interiority; the transformation is smooth and relatively cost-light. A touch more friction or ambivalence in how she gives up her old stance would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is vivid and specific—a charming rogue scholar whose competence and desperation are well established through concrete history (closed libraries, interrogation rooms) and present choices (planting under drones). Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in ideological commitment rather than convenience. However, there’s little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle—she never seriously wavers or missteps—so the internal conflict feels flatter than the premise allows. The final stance is more confirmation than hard-won evolution, which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s longing, insomnia, and compulsion to keep writing are vivid and consistent, and the endurance-choice at the end (“She continues…”) feels earned. However, her conflict is mostly described rather than dramatized in concrete, moment-to-moment micro-choices. We see almost no specific actions beyond writing and waiting, which slightly flattens her as a lived person. Still, her interior stance is clear and particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The caretaker’s motivation and sensibility are sharply etched: her “foxglove regret” and reverent routine feel specific and internally coherent. Her choices (to keep working, to accept endless preservation without joining the living) read as a quiet, earned stasis rather than a revelation. However, we see relatively little contradiction or active struggle on the page—her inner state is more described than tested—which keeps the character just short of fully electrifying. The piece prioritizes role and mood over a sharper, scene-level test of her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivations (to complete the work, vindicate Elian’s theory, and bridge their silence) are rich and consistent, and her interiority is specific rather than generic. Her mix of fear and compulsion (“carefully reckless”) shows credible contradiction, and her micro-actions—uncorking the inkwell, choosing to write despite the risks—align with those motives. The relationship with Elian has clear history and emotional stakes, and the final shared moment of restored connection feels earned. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of her flaws or blind spots producing concrete mistakes or visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific: her engineering mindset, grief, and inherited precision all show in how she reads stone decay and collects adhesive samples. Her motive to find and understand her father is clear and evolves into a decision to continue his work, with a felt cost in accepting his absence. Emotional states are generally embodied through tools and environment (“trembling fingers,” the chain, the breathing amphitheater), though occasionally phrased in slightly abstract terms. The endurance-choice at the end—accepting his reasons and taking up the burden—is well-earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s interior life is specific and textured—courier training, the accident, the silent aviary, and her inherited grief all cohere into a clear, motivated stance. Her contradictory impulses (withdrawing from birds yet obsessively decoding a new form of message) are credible and embodied rather than labeled. The final realization about trust grows logically from her earlier habits of waiting and refusal. The only ceiling is that we never see her values tested against another on-page character, so relational pressure is purely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her way of reading wood grain and distances is distinct—and her final crossing of the threshold is motivated by accumulated insight about drift, codes, and her mother. However, her inner conflict is relatively low-grade: she moves from observational passivity to decision, but we don’t feel a strong push–pull between staying and going or any sharp, contradictory impulse in the peak beat. The relationship with the mother is thematically rich yet lightly dramatized, with their reunion arriving smoothly rather than under evident relational strain or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marek’s motivation and interiority are clear and specific—he’s driven by an inherited question about belonging, and that lens colors every perception. The heirloom feather and his reverence for the old researchers show him as a particular person, not a stock explorer. However, his interior conflict stays relatively smooth; we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses under pressure, so the final realization, while earned, feels a touch too tidy. The visible cost is more situational (the flooding facility) than a painful, character-defining renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is sharply drawn through her method and temperament, and the fisher’s grief is cleanly sketched with economical strokes. Her professional stance—the “cheerful gloom” and comfort with ambiguity—feels specific and motivates her final framing choice. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (her love of uncertainty vs. duty to a grieving father), and could be pushed harder under peak pressure. Still, reactions, motives, and micro-choices all read coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marek’s analytical, probabilistic outlook is sharply rendered and consistent, and his motivations for choosing this liminal performance window are clear. However, he experiences little internal friction or contradiction; he is largely a finished idea rather than a character under pressure. The lack of on-page cost or genuinely difficult choice keeps his arc from feeling transformative. This reads as an elegant character sketch more than a fully pressured interior journey.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tide dancer’s motivations (choosing exile, learning to “breathe different air,” creating a verse that outlasts the nostalgia ban) are clear and consistent, with good interior texture. Her emotions are embodied through sensory detail rather than labels. However, her internal conflict is mostly pre-resolved; there’s little in-the-moment hesitation or contradiction as she inks the mortal, so the closing lightness feels almost too easily earned. The woman receiving the verse functions more as a reflecting surface than an active pressure, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glazier’s sensibility and vocation are sharply etched, and her way of thinking about glass and water feels individual rather than generic. However, she faces almost no on-page pressure, so we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The closing “lesson” she carries into the day is more affirmation than change, with minimal visible cost. This keeps the characterization from reaching genuinely transformative depth.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied; her scars, ritual trek, and role as trainer all grow credibly from the same wound. The “bargain” with loss and her acceptance of being both necessary and breakable read as an earned stasis rather than a neat cure. Contradictory impulses—guilt vs. commitment, tenderness vs. hardness—coexist on the page. The only limitation is that her present-tense ambivalence is largely settled before the scene, so we see reaffirmation more than a genuinely pressured new shift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she’s a “logical dreamer” committed to systematizing hope—but her interiority stays largely in summarized, declarative mode. We rarely see live, contradictory impulses or embodied emotional struggle; she simply and serenely continues the work she already believes in. The ending’s “choice” to persist is believable but carries little felt cost on the page. Character reads interesting and specific, but not yet deep or pressurized enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s vocation, inheritance, and solitude are clear and character-specific, and her quiet dedication feels credible. However, her interior conflict is muted; we don’t see much tension between competing impulses, only steady purpose. The emotional shift from isolation to connection at the end is earned but subtle, with limited dramatized cost. Ashworth functions more as an off-page echo than a crucible relationship, which keeps characterization somewhat cool.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    Aria’s nature and long life are clearly sketched—“borrowed heartbeat,” centuries of movement, patient temperament—but her interior conflict is minimal. Her motives (to awaken mirrors to possibility) are coherent yet untested by any resistance. The piece shows traits through action (her careful song, her slow, deliberate movement) rather than labels, which helps specificity. However, there’s no moment where contradictory impulses collide or where she pays an emotional price for her choice, which keeps the arc relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maren is sharply etched: her history, professional identity, and grief-driven methodology feel particular and coherent, and her realization about what peace does/doesn’t do for the dead is well-earned. Varen and Sera are efficiently but vividly sketched, with their losses informing their stances. The gesture of Varen touching the clipboard is a strong embodied choice that reveals character and status. A few lines (“turned her sorrow into methodology”) slide into authorial abstraction rather than dramatized interior contradiction, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is sharply etched: her amoral philanthropy, obsessive grief, and self-imposed isolation cohere and clearly drive her choices. Interiority is specific (the last male dying in her hands, the sacrifices of marriage/friendship), and the moral ambiguity feels unflinching rather than hedged. Internal conflict is present but somewhat muted in-scene; she is already committed, so the moment doesn’t strongly stage contradictory impulses struggling in real time. The final endurance/renunciation (walking away, trusting the system she’s built) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtesan’s interiority is vivid and specific, with a clear throughline of quiet defiance rooted in long-term observation of the palace. Her motivations for harvesting echoes and preserving an inviolate self are coherent and consistently expressed. What’s missing for higher bands is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or real internal risk—she never seems truly tempted by the lullaby, so the “change” is more intensification than hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and particular—“urbane calligrapher’s precision” and the colonizer metaphor show a self-aware, morally implicated artist. His core want (to tell profound stories) and emerging need (ethical restraint) are clear and in tension. However, almost all relational pressure with Mira is off-page, so we don’t see their dynamic as a live crucible, and his serenity undercuts any sense of real emotional disarray. The shift he undergoes is credible but comparatively smooth, with little visceral embodiment or messy contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation, temperament, and core motivation are vivid and consistent, and her calm, competent response to the crisis is well-motivated by the “esoteric realist” frame. Her choices (where she stations herself, how she builds, how she improvises) clearly express character. What’s missing, at this level, is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost—she rarely feels pushed against her limits emotionally. The ending endurance/renunciation (accepting the grove’s transience and rebuilding) is earned but not especially conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara’s motivation and history are clearly etched—her former role, guilt, self-forged forgiveness, and current resolve all cohere and directly drive her choice to rework the rope. Interiority is specific enough to feel character-bound rather than generic, especially in her “technically gentle” touch and artisan’s mindset. The arc from paralysis to active stewardship is convincing, though the crucial work of forgiveness occurs off-page in summary, which slightly softens the on-page turn. Emotional conflict is more recalled than actively contested in-scene, limiting the sense of live contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Foresight’s core motivation (following the directive and dream toward the “threshold”) is clear and consistent, and her interiority has a distinct, slightly ceremonial cast. However, we get very little contradiction or genuine struggle—she moves through the motions with near-perfect composure. The realization about the directive feels more intellectual than emotionally earned, so “Then she transcended” lands as conceptually neat but not psychologically grounded. More embodied hesitation or competing impulses would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maruk’s frugality, devotion to pattern, and belated recognition of the covenant give him a specific and coherent psychology, and his choice to perform the ritual is clearly motivated by that temperament. However, his emotions in the climactic act are handled more as summary than as embodied struggle, so contradictory impulses (empirical skepticism vs. ritual faith) are more told than dramatized. The internal “cost” of taking on this role—fear, doubt, or moral hesitation—remains relatively abstract. Strong, but not yet at the depth or tension a top-tier venue would look for.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s pacifism-as-strategy and Kael’s long-held resentment are clear, distinct, and their dynamic is the real crucible of the piece. Her refusal to use force but determination to “scheme” under pressure is credible and specific. Kael’s shift from brittle grievance to openness reads earned but a bit rapid, with his interiority more summarized than embodied. Occasional therapy-like formulations (“resentment is a cage we build ourselves”) flatten what is otherwise nuanced characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira’s vocation, worldview, and patience are sharply rendered, and her actions cleanly follow from her role as someone who “erases boundaries.” However, she faces almost no real resistance, and we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or emotional cost as she works. The visiting woman is purely functional and vanishes, so relationships never become a crucible. The ending offers more of a serene fulfillment than a pressured choice, which keeps the characterization from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions (pride vs. desire to mend, professional identity vs. maternal guilt) are clear and consistently dramatized through her choices to return, repair, and offer the ribbon. Interiority is specific to her craft and history, not generic, and the use of her father’s tools plus the daughter’s ribbon grounds generational tension. The final stance shift—to ask for help and admit wrongness—feels earned by what we’ve seen of her stubbornness. A slight drawback is how directly some traits are labeled (“endearingly feisty”) rather than fully left to the reader to infer.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is specific and vivid—a competent, bewildered curator whose habits (retreating to the bathroom, turning the cameo over, finally voicing the question) reveal character. Her core motivation (to understand what she’s inherited) is clear and stable. Internal conflict, however, stays relatively soft—curiosity largely overwhelms fear, so the final shift toward “understanding” feels a touch easy, with limited sense of cost. The absence of another on-page character limits relational pressure, keeping her contradictions mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s role, skillset, and mission are clear and her interiority feels particular to an “arcane linguist” with a botanical lexicon. However, she faces little on-page opposition and makes few pressured micro-choices; most of her “decisions” are framed as already accepted assignments. The implied shift—from seeing her work as preservation to understanding it as negotiating loss—lands, but it’s conceptual rather than dramatized through a conflicted moment. A touch more embodied ambivalence or a visible cost at the end would deepen her characterization substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—“curse of blissful aberration” and the double-exposed childhood cleanly establish a complex self. Her motivation (recapturing what memories can’t hold, drawn by her brother’s obsession) is clear and consistent. Internal conflict (curse vs. mercy; obsession vs. grief) is present but mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page decision. The closing move—pressing the card to her chest and stepping forward—reads as an incremental deepening rather than a costly, character-redefining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation as a meticulous, curious archivist is clear and consistent, and her professional habits convincingly shape her choices. The link to her grandmother’s “fables of absence” gives her a particular history and lens. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or emotional cost—she moves from question to triumph with little friction—so the arc feels more competent than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply defined through vocation, body, and perception; her ripple-marked skin and mapkeeper habits make her feel specific and competent. Motivation is clear and consistent—seeking silence as refuge for herself and others—and her choice to take and use the sacred stone is a credible stretching of prior vows. Internal conflict is relatively muted (she rarely feels visibly torn on the page), so we don’t see much contradictory impulse in-scene. Nonetheless, her endurance and small acts of rule-breaking read as an earned, quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is clearly motivated, with her custodianship, retrocognitive gift, and attachment to the beacon giving her a coherent inner world, and her choice to ascend the tower with the prism grows logically from those traits. However, her interiority leans toward reverent explanation rather than dramatized ambivalence; we rarely see contradictory impulses in live tension, and there is little sense of risk or moral cost to her decision. The “retrocognitive blessing” is absorbed without visible psychological complication or limitation. The ending offers endurance and renewed purpose, but the personal price of that stance is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archivist’s interiority is distinctive and coherent, especially her “preemptively nostalgic” stance and understanding of memory as method. However, she faces very little on-page opposition or concrete dilemma; most of her “choices” (walking, observing, writing) are uncontested and reflective. Emotional movement is present but subtle, more a clarification of a pre-existing worldview than a pressured change. This softens the sense of earned cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation, lineage, and motivation are sharply etched, and her reverence for the rag knot and the counting chant make her feel particular rather than generic. Her drive to bring light against the vanished stars is consistent and grounds her choices. What’s missing for a higher score is a live internal contradiction or real micro-level doubt under pressure—she never seriously wavers. The final act of lighting the spiral feels earned but relatively uncostly emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and credible, with the chronicler’s mindset organically shaping how she experiences the conflict and the grotto. Her need to reconcile with her sister is clear and consistent with her history and vocation. The central micro-choice—placing the cicada between them instead of withdrawing—feels motivated and costly. The sister remains more a silhouette than a fully realized counter-presence, which slightly flattens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and particular, with her bunker upbringing, fear, and hunger for new kinds of silence all in tension at once. Her micro-choices—climbing through the inverted doorway, setting down and then reclaiming the doll, deciding to return to the bunker with a changed stance—feel motivated and consistent. The contradictory impulses (safety vs. openness, resentment vs. understanding of her father) are present on the page without being over-explained. The only limit is that her final reframing of “limitation” lands a touch quickly and conceptually for the emotional weight it carries.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s vocation, competence, and inheritance from her grandmother are sharply drawn, and her choices (extending the route, deploying the vial, humming) feel grounded in that characterization. However, she faces little real resistance or internal contradiction; her “fluidly logical” mindset is affirmed rather than tested. The emotional cost to her is minimal beyond professional care. The boy functions primarily as an object of her work rather than a full character, which keeps the relational crucible fairly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, rooted in long study and a desire to reach the stairway, and her competence as a lore keeper is convincingly dramatized through methodical actions. However, internal conflict is minimal: she moves from seeker to “candidate” with little visible ambivalence or fracture. The realization that she is meant to be guardian feels earned but emotionally smooth, with limited sense of risk or doubt. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadow keeper’s psychology is coherent and particular: someone who burns bridges as an act of self-preservation, then must confront the cost of that strategy. Her motives are clear and organically embedded in the imagery of drowning, suffocation, and amputation. The internal contradiction—needing distance to breathe, then learning that distance is its own suffocation—lands convincingly in the final choice to leave the sanctuary. The piece leans toward conceptualized emotion over fully embodied feeling, but not enough to break credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s psychology as a pyramid-scheme survivor is distinct and drives her ambivalence toward the texts and the “quantum promise.” Her contradictory impulses—mistrust vs. seduction by possibility—are clear and embodied (the bolt’s teeth in her palm, the tears she doesn’t expect). The final shift toward being “ready to make promises again” feels earned by the preceding interiority. A slight weakness is that the parallel Maya is more a thematic mirror than a fully pressured character, but this doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s basic motives (summoned by the estate, estranged from the dynasty) are clear, and her choice to enter the forbidden reading room and operate the gramophone aligns with a curious, ambivalent heir. However, her interior conflict—having “spent fifteen years convincing herself that bloodlines were merely accidents of history”—is only lightly dramatized in the present scene, with little simultaneous push-pull on the page. Emotional response to the uncanny event is underdeveloped; she acts more as a sensibility for atmosphere than a fully pressured character. The absence of on-page change or concrete renunciation by the truncated end limits the depth of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aldric is clearly motivated—a withdrawn knight seeking erasure of memory who instead finds a new, values-based allegiance—and his choices (reading, vowing, animating, then leaving) track cleanly from that. The interiority is specific enough (guilt, withdrawal, the appeal of forgotten places) to avoid stock-hero vibes. However, his internal conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses within the scene; he never really wavers once the vow is spoken. The final change feels earned but somewhat low-friction, with limited sense of real risk to his chosen stasis of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific—her aversion to deciding fates and her compulsion to preserve decisions feel lived-in and particular. Her broken-hearted motivation is clearly grounded in personal loss and aligned with her archivist role. However, the piece leans heavily on explanatory backstory over dramatized micro-choices under pressure, and her final “shift” toward reverent documentation is more an affirmation than a hard-earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation and competence are sharply defined—her careful resourcefulness, invisibility, and loyalty to suppressed truth feel coherent and specific. Her choices (preserving documents, following the contingency route, committing to distribute the archive) clearly arise from those traits. What’s missing at this level is textured contradiction: we rarely see fear, doubt, or competing impulses destabilize her, so she reads a bit too clean under pressure. A little more embodied emotional cost in the escape and discovery beats would deepen her.

    The saxophonist is distinctly etched as a generational caretaker, with embodied detail (tarnished brass, ragged breath) grounding his role. His motivation—upholding the family duty to contain the prophecy—is clear and consistent, and his tactics under pressure (changing register, sharp notes to shatter fragments) feel specific to him. However, internal contradiction is only lightly touched (nostalgia vs obligation) and never fully dramatized as a live conflict; he never seriously wavers or missteps. The final endurance choice (returning each dawn) is earned but could carry more visible emotional cost to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Seraphina is clearly motivated by duty and long practice, and her choices (reading the birch leaf, descending to the vault, retrieving the seed) arise naturally from that role. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulse; her emotional life is largely serene and predetermined by vocation. The notion that she “always emerged transformed” is intriguing but undercut by the lack of a visible cost or specific, character-particular struggle in this scene. As a result, the final “change” feels more like a continuation of her essence than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent—her refusal to accept her brother’s death and the lost compass coherently drives every choice, culminating in her descent underground. The opening line (“uncertainly certain”) gestures at an inner contradiction, but that conflict doesn’t fully surface in on-page micro-choices or embodied ambivalence during the greenhouse sequence. Emotional response to the letter and to entering the dangerous, decayed space is under-dramatized, keeping us a bit too rationally aligned with her quest. Still, she feels specific and non-generic, with occupation and grief sensibly shaping perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s grief, guilt, and professional caution versus her brother’s risk-taking create a clear, compelling inner tension that drives every choice, from lighting the forge to choosing kintsugi. Her motivation to understand both the coin and her brother feels specific and rooted in shared history rather than generic mourning. The shift from wanting to “redeem his work” to recognizing that she has redeemed herself is earned by the preceding reflection and action. The one limitation is that her struggle never quite destabilizes her competence; she moves from decision to decision with relatively little internal resistance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid, with a clear, particular motivation (“fearlessness that wasn't courage but simply exhaustion with fear itself”) and embodied vocation; the ache of her own losses quietly underpins her choices. The soldier is thinner but still specific enough to matter, especially through his shame and the milk-out-the-nose memory. Internal contradiction is more told than dramatized in-scene, and Mira is never really pushed into a hard choice that would expose deeper conflict. The ending offers an earned endurance rather than a sharp turn, which fits but limits how far the characterization can cut.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—the shame “that lived in her stomach rather than her mind” and her hatred of having talked under torture feel psychologically precise. Her enhanced proprioception is not just a label but a lens through which all experience is filtered, deepening her damage/competence contradiction. The final stance—choosing not to remove the strap and to face the clearing despite suspected cost—reads as an earned, if quiet, alteration. The only slight limit is the absence of on-page interpersonal dynamics, which keeps her conflict entirely intrapsychic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific, with the long, puzzled relationship to the lens and the inherited role from the grandmother grounding motivation. Her talent as a “reader of the in-between” and her sense of responsibility to the fragment feel organic. The main weakness is that internal conflict is under-pressured: once the revelation comes, her acceptance of the Keeper mantle faces little on-page resistance or ambivalence. The final choice reads earned but slightly too smooth for the weight of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus’s mix of professional competence and secret sensitivity to “echoes” is vivid and specific, and his observational habit consistently drives his choices. His motivation to follow the presence and the story it offers is clear and coherent with his nature. What’s missing at this level is a sharper internal contradiction or visible cost—he engages almost too smoothly, without meaningful resistance or peril. The final choice to investigate the hatch feels fitting but low-stakes emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s role and long history are crisply defined, and her attachment to non-negotiable tools (the press, metal, ink) gives her a specific worldview. However, she moves through the story with very little friction or contradiction—she reads the frost, finds the bottle, uses the press, all without hesitation or competing impulses. Her final realization (“Some eternities needed to be opened, not held.”) feels conceptually apt but not earned through dramatized internal struggle. The piece succeeds at sketching a particular, competent figure but falls short of a deeply pressurized character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vespera is sharply etched: ex-revolutionary, now meticulous curator, with motives rooted in failure and redirected idealism. Her interiority feels specific (“poet’s heart,” shard metaphors) and her final conceptual shift about single stories is well-earned from prior history. Internal contradiction (rebel vs archivist; poet vs technician) is present, though not always pressed into overt conflict in-scene. The cost of her stance is more implied than dramatized, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cassian’s motivation (honoring the covenant, preserving song/light) is clear and consistent, and his history with the master and the stone individualizes him. The internal conflict—his doubts about whether midnight “understood something” he doesn’t—is present but kept fairly gentle, so contradictory impulses under pressure never fully bite. His endurance and reaffirmation of purpose at the end feel earned by the lifetime of work sketched in backstory. The emotional life is more meditative than raw, which fits the piece but slightly softens the sense of high-stakes inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s profession, disposition, and desire for “thresholds” create a clear, coherent psyche, and her choice to stay is motivated by a lifelong search for this kind of place. Interiority is richly particular—her relationship to petrichor and to abandoned industrial spaces feels lived-in rather than generic. However, the internal conflict at the end skews more contemplative than pressured; we are told she “would not return” but don’t see much immediate tug from the life she’s abandoning, so the renunciation’s cost is somewhat underplayed for this caliber. A hint of contradictory impulse on the page at the lagoon would deepen the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aria is vividly rendered through her tactile relationship with driftwood and the ocean, and her lineage with the grandmother gives her a grounded, specific interior life. Her motivations—to make meaning from wreckage and to understand the lantern slide—are clear and consistent. The shift from solitary maker to conscious member of a generational "alliance" feels earned, though the internal conflict is more reflective than actively torn between competing impulses. A slightly greater sense of risk or ambivalence around accepting that lineage could deepen the felt cost of her final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation—understanding night-blooming flowers—is clear and consistent, and her persistence across seasons feels grounded in character. Interiority is vivid and sensorially rich, but her inner life is more contemplative than conflicted, with little sense of genuine risk or contradictory impulses under pressure. The final realization is earned by prior curiosity and observation but doesn’t ask much of her in terms of cost or renunciation. This keeps the arc emotionally satisfying yet relatively low-stakes at a characterological level.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Miriam’s motivation—answering a thirty-year familial and historical call—is clear and consistent, and her professional background as a civil-rights archivist smartly deepens that drive. Interiority is textured (“reverie tightening around her heart”), and her values around memory and suffering feel particular rather than generic. However, her internal conflict never quite sharpens into a concrete dilemma on the page; she moves from discovery to response with little resistance or competing impulse. The final “witness” role is thematically apt but lands more as confirmation than a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to rebuild a civilization without wish-magic—is clear, consistent, and embodied in his refusal of comfort and his choice to use the bottle. His interiority is specific in places (“Comfort was a trap…”) and tied to past experiences. However, he remains more archetypal than deeply idiosyncratic, and we see limited on-page contradiction or active struggle—he’s largely serenely executing a plan already decided. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost emotionally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Seraphine is sharply defined through vocation, sensibility, and how she reads the foghorn’s silence; her actions—bringing the wax shaving to the rooftop, choosing to immerse—align cleanly with her role as last oath scribe. The interiority is concrete and character-specific (“silence so complete it seemed to demand replacement”) rather than generic. However, internal conflict is muted: she moves from recognition to acceptance with little on-page friction or contradictory impulse, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in vocation, lineage, and temperament (“furiously tranquil” as an inherited paradox) and her motives for attempting the ritual tonight are clear and consistent. The piece tracks her long preparation and conceptual obsession with “borrowed time” in a way that makes the final realization earned. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely experiences simultaneous, competing impulses, so the peak beat feels more like a practiced fulfillment than a pressured choice. The cost of her dedication (personal losses, doubts, or blind spots) is mostly implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is crisply drawn through her work habits, sensory focus, and reverence for the liminal moment before the siren, with competence grounded in concrete tasks (glue, soldering, diagnostics). Her motivation—protecting the valleys by listening to subtle atmospheric cues—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is only lightly suggested (she enjoys the hush even as her job is to break it), so her final act feels more like fulfillment than a pressured, costly choice. The result is strong but not deeply conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The janitor’s vocation, reverence, and empathy are clearly and consistently motivated, and their micro-choices around the fragment (kneeling, waiting, tracing before moving) reveal a solid, specific inner life. However, their interiority trends toward serene certainty; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure. The late articulation of “strength in vulnerable openness” feels like confirmation of an existing state rather than a hard-won shift. This keeps the piece from achieving a deeper, more costly internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization as an “astonished recluse” with “tranquilly perceptive” attention is specific and coherent, and her acceptance of the covenant is a credible extension of those traits. Her motives—seeking solitude yet choosing to bear witness—are clear and quietly paradoxical, creating a subtle but real internal tension. However, that tension remains largely implicit; we don’t see her truly wrestle with the cost of taking on the burden. The ghost is mostly a function, not a full character, but that suits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation (to understand the texture of time) is clear and consistent, and her professional context as a timekeeper feels specific. However, she experiences relatively little on-page contradiction or dilemma—she mostly contemplates rather than choosing between competing impulses. The emotional arc from curiosity to realization is coherent but somewhat smooth, with minimal felt cost. Her interiority is vivid yet a bit uniform in register, so she reads as conceptually strong but not fully humanly messy.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet is psychologically coherent: their instinct to gather and mend “damaged things” motivates all major actions and is embodied rather than labeled. Interiority is specific (e.g., misidentifying the feather as from a drake, then kingfisher) and filtered through their maker/healer lens. The relationship with the kingfisher is quiet but legible as a mutual, tentative trust. The internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we get a stance on incompleteness, but little moment-to-moment struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren is sharply etched: a lifelong caretaker whose response to a terminal diagnosis is to “double her workload,” which aligns with her devotion and quietly stubborn temperament. Her interiority is grounded in specific vocational concerns (root systems, microclimates, bird migrations) rather than generic philosophizing. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—she will not see the results of her work—but the acceptance of that loss is credibly earned. Internal contradiction is muted; she is serenely consistent rather than actively torn, which slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s characterization as a rigorously empirical scientist shaken into a crisis of belief is clear, specific, and consistent, and her rebellious streak (costing her position) grounds her stakes. Her internal conflict—skepticism versus wonder, artificial pilgrimage versus genuine seeking—runs through the piece and credibly motivates her choices. The change at the end (carrying “better questions,” accepting a transformed self) feels earned by the preceding interior work, though much of it is told rather than dramatized in concrete micro-choices. A bit more embodied contradiction under pressure (beyond reflection) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    The coachman’s motivation to restore the reef is clear and consistent, and his role as mediator between life and death is conceptually strong. However, he reads more as an archetypal figure than a fully individuated person, with little concrete, character-specific interiority beyond his function. There’s almost no visible internal conflict or contradictory impulse around his act; he performs the ritual with calm certainty. The final smile lands, but it doesn’t feel like a costly or contested shift so much as a foregone, symbolic culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motives (find brother / unlock cylinder) are clear, consistent, and tied to specific skills like the “bloodhound nose” and recovery background. Emotional life is present and particular, especially in the relationship to the brother and the leaf, but internal conflict is relatively mild—there’s not much contradiction or hard choice on the page. The final understanding feels earned by prior setup rather than arbitrary insight. However, the piece stops short of exposing a real flaw or costly misbelief in the protagonist, which keeps the character arc from fully deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira reads as a specific, competent, wounded person whose “blessed pariah” status and inherited tradition convincingly shape her presence on the deck. Her core motivation—to make sense of the shutdown and her role in it—is clear and tracks cleanly into the final stance shift. However, her internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly into acceptance, with limited dramatized contradiction or flailing under pressure, which blunts the sense of real cost. The emotional arc is believable but errs toward tidy insight rather than messier, more pressured complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Caelius’s motivation—amending a specific old theft—reads clear and consistent, and his chivalrous code plus lingering guilt give him dimension. Interiority is vivid in the first pass (“her tear-streaked face still visited him in dreams”), but the restart compresses that texture into flatter summary. Seraph’s emotional stance is intriguing (neither accusation nor forgiveness) but underused as a source of pressure once she arrives. The final relief (“for the first time, the weight lifted”) is earned but lands on the quiet side because competing impulses in the present scene are only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivations and history are sharply etched—the crisis-actor-to-survivor trajectory and the archivist of “small gestures” are distinctive and coherent. Her relationship to her sister and the chessboard renders her grief specific rather than generic. However, most of her conflict is settled reflection rather than live contradiction on the page; we’re told she has “unbound herself” more than we see competing impulses collide in-scene. The final renunciation/acceptance feels earned but emotionally modulated, not quite at maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seer’s motivation—fleeing the pain of remembering yet still seeking the “shape of home”—is coherent and deepens through her nightly ritual with the stone. Her internal contradiction (fear of her gift vs. longing for connection to ancestry and home) is dramatized in her delay over the “seed” question and her eventual decision to ask it. Embodied details like mercury-glass hands and feather-textured glyphs keep emotion grounded rather than purely abstract. The final decision to leave the mountain feels earned by the prior interior struggle and carries a visible cost: surrendering the illusion of safety the bookstore provided.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s shame, professional pride, and compulsion to “fidget productively” create a clear, specific psyche, and her choice to approach the labyrinth and work the tapestry feels organically motivated. The exile backstory is efficiently sketched and credibly informs her fixation on patterns and failure. The final self-forgiveness reads earned rather than arbitrary, though it edges toward being stated a touch too plainly. Internal contradiction (pride vs. guilt, avoidance vs. compulsion to decode) is present and believable, if not ruthlessly probed.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sera’s motivation—refusing further erasures and weaponizing art against ritualized forgetting—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized via her choices (writing on the tower, choosing poetry over prophecy, gathering children). Her interiority is vivid (“the price of forgiveness…paid in advance”) and her flaw of long complicity gives the ending’s self-forgiveness real weight. The child functions as an effective relational mirror that sharpens Sera’s stance without stealing focus. The only slight limitation is that her internal conflict in the present is mostly resolved before the priests arrive, so the climactic beat carries more confirmation than fresh struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in a long history of work, failure, and doubt, and her choice to spend her last breaths on memory is both surprising and well-motivated. The tension between her craving for meaning and lifelong allegiance to uncertainty feels genuinely conflicted rather than tidily resolved. Her embodied actions—pressing the charm to the statue, matching scars, holding her breath—track cleanly with her motives. The only slight limitation is how smoothly she attains her final acceptance under extreme time pressure, which trims some potential messiness from the change.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, and his arc from stasis to re-engagement with art feels psychologically credible. The mirror trauma, grandmother, and shell all feed into a coherent misbelief about possession and beauty. The key choice—releasing the painted shell—is well-motivated by prior grief and the remembered promise, with a visible emotional cost. A minor limitation is that contradictory impulses (resistance vs. surrender to painting) could surface more in-scene rather than mostly as reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is clearly motivated—to learn the lighthouse’s “song” and help the ships—and her internal process in the climactic jasmine scene is specific and embodied. The grandmother/Thessaly lineage gives her desire texture without over-explaining. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction: there’s little sense of doubt, fear of failure, or competing impulses under pressure, which softens the cost of her choice. A slightly more resistant or self-divided reaction to the responsibility of tending the light alone would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s vocation, tools (the censer foot), and worldview make her feel particular and motivated, and her choice to go to the caller and walk “north together” is consistent with the patchwork, grief-guiding navigator we’ve come to know. Interiority is concrete enough (moon phases, emotional tides) to ground her, and the woman at the marsh, though thinly sketched, serves effectively as a pressure point on Mara’s calling. However, we don’t see much live contradiction or real-time wobble in Mara—she moves toward her role with little visible internal friction—so the emotional cost remains mostly implied rather than dramatized. The final endurance/recommitment is credible but more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—her forager’s mindset, her memory of pre-virus emotion, and her attraction to discredited cures all cohere into a distinct psyche. Motivation is clear and consistent: she risks herself to preserve and restore emotional connection. The biggest limitation is that her “radiantly, involuntarily truthful” flaw never faces an on-page test in this scene, so internal conflict stays mostly conceptual. The closing choice to study in the hollow is earned but low-temperature, more a continuation than a sharpened renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric’s inner life feels specific—his status as “part of the landscape” and carrier of others’ memories is vivid, and his curiosity about the stranger’s gesture is credible and sustained. The link between the Edelweiss and his mother’s abandonment is powerful, giving him a legible wound and desire. However, his emotional progression from isolation to readiness for reconnection is a bit smooth and unconflicted; there’s little visible resistance or mixed impulse when the truth lands. A touch more contradiction or cost in deciding to reach back would strengthen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren is vivid and particular—her history with maps, the tactile way she relates to the chip, and her willingness to follow ants all feel character-specific and grounded in her life with her father. Her motivation (to honor his promise and find “the way home”) is clear and governs her choices. What’s missing at this standard is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses at the climax; she feels remarkably certain and calm where a touch more visible ambivalence or fear would deepen the cost of stepping through. The internal conflict is implied more than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The queen’s disenchantment, duty, and buried capacity for wonder are clear and consistent, and her choice to climb instead of delegating feels rooted in character. We get concrete interiority (“crown weighted with memories that no longer sparkled”) and a believable long fatigue. However, genuine internal conflict is muted—there’s little sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses at the peak. Her renewed purpose at the end comes somewhat easily, without much on-page struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren’s intellectual and emotional throughline is clear and particular—the blend of mathematician, alchemist, and romantic feels specific, and her shift from extraction to acknowledgment is credibly motivated by long-term research. However, her interiority is almost entirely aligned with a single desire; we rarely see genuinely competing impulses or a live temptation to cling to the old model. The relationship with Sera adds a faint crucible, but Sera doesn’t exert much real pressure beyond being an attentive listener. The final “choice” reads more as a serene realization than a conflicted, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and self-contradictory: a scholar of dreams who both craves and despises lucidity, jealous of his past self yet still compelled to chronicle. Motivation (to “distill chaos into narrative”) is clear and carries through to the plan to mail the scroll and the choice to surrender to sleep. The “chronologist’s disease” and feral nostalgia give him distinctive flaws rather than generic melancholy. The ending functions as an earned stasis: he accepts drowning/surrender at visible emotional cost, even if external action remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena is sharply realized: her prior work with scent, the loss of smell, and her transfer of that mapping instinct to time and touch create a specific, credible psyche. Her mourning-to-acceptance shift is gradual and well motivated, especially through her response to the birthing clamp screw and the almost-smelled tea. Internal conflict (loss vs new ways of sensing) is present if quiet, and her final stance—no longer mourning but reconfiguring what “sensing” means—feels earned. Mira is lightly but effectively sketched, with the midwife backstory adding depth and a subtle relational crucible without needing overt confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand why the runes resist her and to turn scars into stories) is clear, specific, and consistent, and her shame about the crystallizing is well-embodied. The internal contradiction between scholarly cynicism and childhood superstition plays out credibly in her choices on the platform. The final shift—accepting the crystals and superstition as part of her method—feels earned by prior beats. The only limitation is that her flaws and blind spots are resolved a bit cleanly for the compressed length, with relatively little visible cost beyond past pain.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is rich, specific, and credibly conflicted—her talent for mediated, metaphorical empathy set against her fear of confronting unfixable damage. Her core motive (apologize, reconnect) feels both clear and self-sabotaging in a human way. Margot is thinner but still distinct in voice and stance, with her single voiced moment cutting cleanly. The final endurance—carrying “an apology delivered too late to matter and just in time to begin again”—reads as an earned, costly stasis rather than easy growth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara has a clear role and distinctive relationship to language and the Archive, but her concrete wants and fears in this moment are only implied, not dramatized. Her dictionary as talisman and her practiced ritual suggest depth, yet we don't see contradictory impulses or a pressured choice. There is no visible change or renunciation by the end of the passage. Character feels promising but still in setup mode rather than under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aira’s vocation, patience, and idiosyncratic philosophy of time are clear and specific, and her devotion to the clocks reads as deeply rooted and believable. However, she experiences almost no genuine internal push–pull; the revelation that “clocks measured change itself” feels like a natural extension of what she’s already been thinking rather than a hard-won reversal. Interiority is nicely embodied through tactile engagement with machinery and landscape, but her emotional range stays in a narrow register of reverent attentiveness. The final commitment to “seventeen years more” lands as endurance rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s inner world is specific and consistent—her spatial perception of relationships, professional background, and reverence for boundaries feel integrated and character-particular. The tension between her departure and her devotion to careful distance is present but could be more embodied and less purely conceptual. The two coworkers function intentionally as “familiar strangers,” adding pressure without breaking the chosen reserve. The final realization about “the most careful kind of love” is emotionally earned, if still rendered in an intellectual register.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and credibly torn between her mathematical rationalism and her emotional inheritance from a compulsive gambler father. Her habits—photographing the scrawls, walking the subway route in her mind, bringing the lantern—are all character-revealing micro-choices that pay off at the bedside. The father is efficiently but vividly drawn through memory and his altered gaze in the final scene. The closing realization feels earned by prior contradictions rather than a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is sharply etched: the seasoned tunnel worker whose vocation is listening to other people’s endings, with clear habits (never correcting callers, learning their patterns) that reveal a coherent psychology. Her grief and solitude are embodied via sensory relationship to the tunnel and the harmonica disc rather than abstract labels. However, she faces no concrete on-page dilemma; the piece confirms her stance rather than testing or complicating it. The lack of an in-scene choice or cost limits the depth of internal contradiction and keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interior life is rich and specific, with the archivist’s meticulousness, fear of “looking too closely,” and evolving stance toward preservation all coherently motivating her actions. Contradictory impulses—wanting to protect the image vs. needing to re-examine it—are present but could be sharpened into a more acute on-page dilemma. The closure choice (renewing and extending the covenant) feels earned by prior reflection and behavior. However, the absence of any external counter-pressure or relational friction in the present slightly limits the range of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The logistician is sharply etched: the mix of competence, guilt-as-penance, and evasive charm feels specific, and the final confession (“I need someone to remember my name”) is both plausible and earned. Internal conflict—between their practiced elusiveness and their hunger to be known—runs under the whole scene. However, some of the most charged material about their past work is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts the felt cost at the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—her competence as a blind cartographer of the “unchartable” is well embodied through how she reads bark and vibrations. The emotional interiority is concrete and sensory rather than abstract labels. However, internal conflict is minimal: there’s little sense of competing impulses or real resistance to her goal, so the epiphany risks feeling somewhat unopposed. The change at the end (map turned inward) is motivated but comes with limited on-page cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply defined: competent, wounded by past failure, and drawn to ambiguity; her ritual with the pen and embrace of the anomaly show particular, non-generic traits. Her motivation to redeem her interpretive capacities and find meaning in distortion is clear and consistent. Internal conflict—shame vs. comfort in exile, fear of error vs. attraction to riskier, “subjective” methods—exists but remains relatively understated on the page. The final reframing of her “wrong seeds” into a kind of necessary filtering is earned by prior interiority, though the cost (career sidelining) could be felt more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is rich and specific—her inherited silence, work as an interpreter, and evolving understanding of her grandfather’s camera all feel psychologically grounded and consistent. The pivot from rehearsing her grandmother’s tales to improvising her own grief is well-motivated by prior setup. Elena and the old man are sketched economically but credibly, with Elena’s grief and loosening well-rendered in a few strokes. The main limitation is that Marina’s internal conflict is more linear insight than sharply contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (rage at hoarded knowledge + a family promise) is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially the arson backstory and the relentless search for Keth-Soral. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual (her “volcanic tenderness,” her compulsion toward damaged art). Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—the piece tells us she shifted from burning knowledge to preserving it, but we don’t see that conflict tested in-scene. Still, the lineage reveal and her three-year commitment credibly earn the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives (enduring the treatment, resisting objectification, sustaining Mira’s dream) are clear, character-specific, and expressed through concrete micro-choices like choosing not to withdraw consent and secretly repurposing the garden. Her interiority feels embodied and particular (“vomiting stars into the recovery basin,” the quiet satisfaction in letting the scientists “wonder”). The main limitation is that her internal contradiction—fear of harm vs need for connection/rebellion—could be pressed harder in the present moment rather than mostly implied via backstory. Still, her final stance of ongoing, defiant participation reads earned and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s competence, history (father’s death, great-grandmother’s key), and social capital as a quiet hub of the port community are sharply drawn and consistent. Her motivation to save workers and prove the whisper network is clear, but we see little real degradation under stress or internal contradiction; she never feels genuinely at risk of failing. The relationship with Reyes provides status friction and a satisfying beat at the end, though it never becomes a real crucible on the page. The endurance-style closure (continuing her work with a subtly altered hierarchy of knowledge) is credible and earned but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The guardian is rendered with clear history, motive, and a coherent internal logic—her muteness, patience, and inherited role all feel specific and earned. The boy is more symbolic than individuated, but that suits the focus and length. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of her active internal contradiction in the present scene; she endures rather than struggles. The final stance (quiet endurance as vocation) is credible and grounded in prior causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s characterization is distinct and internally coherent—the revolutionary chess coach who weaponizes patience and doubt is vivid and specific. However, she is mostly rendered through exposition and concept rather than on-page, pressured decisions; we don’t see a live moment where contradictory impulses clash in scene. Her core motive (teaching children to question) is clear and aligns with her actions (using the grotto, orchestrating displays), but there’s little sense of personal cost or moral risk. This keeps her compelling but slightly schematic, more emblem than fully dramatized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s interiority is rich and particular: her guardedness, history with occupation, and inherited burden from her father all feel specific rather than generic. The central contradiction—her practiced exterior grace versus the fortress-like interior—is dramatized through micro-choices, especially in how long she clings to the scrimshaw. Her final decision to leave the dock and set down the talisman is well-motivated by that history. The only limit is that her flaws (e.g., how her guardedness has concretely harmed her or others) remain slightly abstract rather than being tested in more than one present-tense beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a former performer weaponizing her stagecraft against a surveillance state while inhabiting a self-declared moral ambiguity. Interiority is specific and textured (“quiet cruelties performed in the name of art”) and her micro-choices—keeping the flowers, whittling, gaming the speakers—align with that history. The endurance stance at the end (choosing a “perfectly, beautifully, defiantly blank” face) is well earned by the preceding contradictions between grief and mandated joy. The only soft spot is the slightly on-the-nose self-labeling (“I am morally ambiguous”) rather than fully trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s desire and outlook are clear and specific—an aesthetically driven poet drawn by a “tremor of certainty” and a life spent watching cloud-shadows. Her motivation to cross the once-forbidden space is coherent, and her interiority is consistently filtered through visual and sonic perception. However, internal conflict is relatively soft; fear of prohibition barely contests her certainty, so her eventual “settled knowledge” feels more like confirmation than a hard-won change. The final shift is credible but low-cost, limiting depth of character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is vivid, with her colorblind perception, attraction to imperfect glass, and deliberate plant-language giving her a coherent inner logic. Her choice to relinquish the concertina reed tongue nicely reveals priorities, but the emotional cost of that sacrifice is underplayed. The apprentice’s arc from puzzled observer to nascent initiate is clear, if somewhat idealized. Internal contradiction or real friction in Mira is minimal, which keeps her compelling but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear, rooted in her history and vocation, and the lens habit gives her a particular, embodied quirk. However, nearly all pressure is conceptual; we get little in-the-moment contradiction or costly micro-choice, so her interior conflict remains more articulated than dramatized. The committee’s resistance and her isolation are told rather than staged, which softens the sense of her being tested. The closing reconfiguration of her belief feels earned but low-cost at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to turn her own unresolved grief into a practice of guiding others—is clear and consistent, with good textural support in her craft and her relationship to the teacher. Her interiority feels particular (mourning jewelry, crushed pearls, origami coordinates) rather than generic, and her quiet assumption of the mentor role at the end is earned. The new arrival is more of an emblem than a fully realized character, which limits relational complexity and visible cost. Internal conflict in the present scene is muted; we’re told more about Elara’s past struggle than we see her actively wrestling with anything now.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren and Soren are both clearly sketched, with concrete vocations and burdens, and their interaction feels grounded in plausible emotional states. Soren’s obsessive need to “map the chaos” and his guilt over having “helped build it” are strong motivators, and Maren’s inherited practice and curiosity credibly shape her tactics. The internal conflict, however, remains relatively straightforward—Soren moves from obsession/guilt to partial relief without much in-the-moment contradiction or regression. The ending change feels real but low-cost, more gentle easing than hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation is clear and evolving—from acquisitive scholarship to surrender and integration—and the seventeen-year pursuit grounds her as rigorous, obsessive, and flawed. Interiority is specific and embodied (veil, breath, footsteps) rather than generic. The internal conflict between wanting to possess knowledge and realizing she must release it is credible and paid off when she steps into the pagoda’s light. The arc stops short of deep moral messiness, but for this length it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is specific and memorable—her tactility with the river stone, dusk-attunement, and archivist role give her a clear interior world and coherent motivation. However, her internal conflict between nostalgia for bodies and commitment to the Unbinding as “metamorphose” remains largely implied; she never faces a sharp on-page test of that contradiction. Her emotions are mostly rendered through perception and concept rather than embodied responses to a present dilemma. The result is a strong but relatively low-pressure portrait rather than a fully crucible-tested character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich, specific, and coherently tied to her professional identity and the Aldric betrayal; the tail work as micro-choices under pressure is excellent. Her emotional conflict—grief, loyalty, anger, and stubborn care—plays simultaneously rather than in tidy stages. The closing stance (“Compassion and self-respect could coexist; she was proof of it”) flirts with a slightly pat articulation, but it’s earned enough by prior scene work not to feel hollow. Overall, she reads as a particular person rather than a type, with a credible, costly shift in how she’ll move forward.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—her guilt, physical scars, and the surgery’s aftermath all feel lived rather than generic. Her motivation (to confront the buried trauma of her brother’s death) is clear and threads through each choice, from choosing the dawn hour to crawling into the tunnel. The revaluation of her scars (“not shame but evidence of love so fierce it had left marks”) is earned by prior detail. The arc is a touch neat in its self-forgiveness, but not implausibly so at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation and interiority are clear, consistent, and well-rooted in her specific gift and sensibility, and the closing Earned Stasis (choosing to leave the film) is credibly motivated. However, her inner conflict remains relatively low-grade; there’s little sense that she might do anything else or that her desire to witness clashes with any competing value. Emotional texture (“unused love,” “goodbyes”) is strong but somewhat uniform, with limited contradictory impulse in scene. The Vance sisters are vivid but function more as archetypal presences than as fully embodied individuals under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Seraphine’s internal state is rich and specific—her desperation, exhaustion, and shame about “trapped creativity” feel lived-in rather than generic, and the grandmother/astrolabe backstory cleanly motivates her fixation. The decisive inner choice to stop striving and rest is credibly earned by accumulated pressure. However, the realization occasionally tips into thesis-speak (“creativity could not be seized. It had to be surrendered to.”), slightly flattening the contradiction and ambiguity that her struggle otherwise builds.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is clear, consistent, and particular—“dreamless freight guard” with a defined duty and a poetic ethic of “cultivat[ing] the sparks.” Her motive to protect the cargo is legible and her refusal of the merchant matches her established role. However, her interiority remains more conceptual than embodied, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or real strain under pressure. The result is appealing but somewhat static characterization rather than a fully pressured internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cyrus is lucidly drawn as a burnt-out rationalist turned mystic, with consistent motives rooted in fear-turned-curiosity about his own mind. His interiority is specific (“questions themselves had grown teeth and memory”), and his choice to place the gear and step through the doorway is psychologically coherent. However, internal contradiction and visible struggle are muted; he moves toward insight with relatively little resistance or ambivalence on the page. The cost of leaving his old life is intellectually acknowledged but not deeply felt somatically or emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The old woman’s fear-versus-longing conflict is rendered with specificity (the leash as “comfortable constraint,” the heartbeat as “quiet stubbornness”), and her final choice to release the leash and step onto the middle path feels earned. Interiority is credible and textured without therapy-speak, and her age and history are implied through physical detail and ritual. The main limitation is that her past is sketched impressionistically, so the concrete cost of prior choices remains somewhat abstract. Still, her internal contradiction and final renunciation are convincing at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus is sharply individualized: a bellhop who once sang in a silent choir, living with nerve regeneration and unspoken guilt, and his every perception is colored by that history. His conflicting impulses—toward safety, toward music/movement, toward penance—are dramatized in the choice not to report the bolt and in his fixation on the bronze trail. The emotional vocabulary largely avoids labels in favor of specific, embodied detail (tingling nerves, weight of the bolt, frostbitten hope). The only limit at this length is that his relationship with the dead brother remains entirely off-page, so the relational crucible is powerful but abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Threnody’s motivation and role are sharply defined, and her methods (ink, annotations) align cleanly with her purpose. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or evolution; this is a portrait of steadfastness, not a pressured arc. The “cost” of her vigil is implied rather than dramatized, so endurance feels more conceptual than felt. Strong characterization, but not yet at the level of complex, contradictory interiority expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete memories (the bleaching, her father’s maps), with her work and reactions clearly motivated by long-term grief and duty. Her micro-choices—stopping the tapping, then changing the rhythm—credibly reveal her shifting stance from numb monitoring to active, hopeful engagement. The piece lacks a sharply dramatized internal contradiction under acute pressure, but for this quiet mode the emotional progression feels earned. The final endurance/renewal stance is believable even if the visible cost remains mostly historical and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kira’s motivations are clear and specific—her attachment to her grandmother, her father’s death, and the need to give the lull meaning all cohere and drive her decision at the circle. The barefoot detail and the “confidence as performance” line give her an embodied, particular texture rather than archetypal rebel-daughter vagueness. However, internal conflict is relatively low-friction: once her insight about the lull “not being an ending” surfaces, there’s little sense of competing impulses or real risk to her choice. The final choice feels emotionally earned but somewhat easy, without much on-page resistance or cost beyond fatigue and fear summarized in the collective.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yara is vivid and specific—her plant-listening, her history with her burned mother, and her lifelong secrecy all ground her motive to break silence now. The tension between fear of persecution and responsibility to the future is present but mostly summarized rather than fully dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Anya is clearly sketched as a foil (overt insurgent vs. covert one), but her inner life is thinner. The final decision to unseal feels consistent and earned, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her interiority is precise and character-specific, with grief embodied through small, tactile choices (soil under nails, the unsmoothed photograph) rather than labels. The refusal to believe in “healing as a destination” reads as a credible, costly stance rather than a tidy lesson. Contradictory impulses—retreat versus ongoing caretaking of fragile life—coexist persuasively. The final realization about what she’s been building feels fully earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is specific, embodied, and coherently tied to her history as an artist whose vision has “failed” her. Her motivation—to understand and potentially redeem her fractured seeing—is clear and expressed through concrete choices (entering the lighthouse, committing to the cards, following the descent). The final reconfiguration of self is mostly earned by the earlier beats, though the speed and tidiness of the insight approaches an easy epiphany. Internal contradiction (fear vs. compulsion, shame vs. curiosity) is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tracker’s motivation is clear and specific (his mines experience, connection to Vasquez, and obsession with time in crisis), and “serene anger” gives him a distinctive emotional coloration. However, his internal state barely evolves; he moves from already-committed obsession into disappearance without much on-page struggle or contradictory impulse at the choice point. Micro-choices are mostly procedural (examining ink, deploying the drone) rather than pressured moral or emotional tradeoffs. The final act of touching the ink feels consistent but not deeply dramatized as a conflicted decision.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira’s duty-vs-truth conflict is clear and sustained, and the detail that she’s been in temporal stasis with the documents nicely personalizes her role. Her emotional beats (trembling, nearly dropping the letter, then steadying) track plausibly. However, her interiority leans on thematic abstraction more than character-particular quirks or flaws, so she reads slightly archetypal. The final brave choice is motivated but could carry more personal cost beyond a generalized moral awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply etched through her opposition to her father and her commitment to tending the roses and sheltering refugees; her pacifism feels rooted and specific rather than generic. The ballast scrap, the memory of his rituals, and her embodied gardening choices all reinforce a coherent inner life. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or live temptation toward her father’s path, so the final stance feels affirmed rather than hard-won. The cost of her chosen isolation and renunciation is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Morwen’s cool-headed, patient nature comes through clearly and motivates his quiet, observational approach to the garden, and his acceptance of the goddess’s echo tracks with that temperament. The rail spike’s significance to him gives a concrete anchor to his interiority. However, his inner conflict remains muted—he rarely wavers or struggles, so the final transformation feels more like fulfillment of type than a pressured, costly choice. A touch more contradiction or resistance around becoming a vessel for a god would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eleanor’s characterization is rich and specific—the observant heiress, shaped by generations of compromise, using a childhood logic lesson to reassess her own guilt is strong, individualized interiority. Her motivation (to break the family cycle and protect journalistic integrity) is clear and consistent with her noticing habits and career choices. The internal turn from self-doubt to analytic rigor via “proof by contradiction” feels earned. What keeps this out of the very top band is the relative smoothness of her emotional path: there’s little on-page push-pull between fear, loyalty, defensiveness, and resolve, so contradictory impulses under pressure never fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and the link between her profession (mapping constellations onto skin) and her final act of “mapping the stars of redemption” is elegant. Interiority is vivid but mostly moves in a single emotional register—regret and awe—without much active contradiction or resistance on the page. Her micro-choices (seeking the lab, lifting the amber, following the coordinates, deciding to “begin to work”) align with motive but rarely force visible trade-offs in-scene. The relationship with the dead sister is powerful but largely mediated through concept rather than embodied, moment-to-moment conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and specific: a whimsical artist clinging to “a comfortable wound” of permanence, now in crisis over whether her art is a lie. Her motives for coming to the grotto and her resistance to impermanence are clear and embodied in gestures like the tremor in her fingers and her compulsion to keep drawing. The final shift—accepting impermanence and reclaiming whimsy as permission rather than performance—feels earned by the prior scene work. The cost (relinquishing her old certainty about “proper art”) is implied but could be made slightly sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lysara’s characterization is vivid and specific—her stubborn preservationism, retrocognitive torment, and reframing of “mercy” into renaming all align cleanly. However, her internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told this is “torture called blessing,” but we don’t see a moment of real hesitation or cost as she acts. Soren functions more as an emblem than a pressured character, which limits relational complexity at the key turn. The final mercy feels motivated and coherent, but emotionally a bit too smooth for the scale of trauma evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply realized, with specific history (“stage ghost for precisely forty-seven years,” “suicide of hope”) and a clear drive for an “encore” that motivates her intervention with Mira. Her synesthetic perceptions give her interiority a distinct texture. Mira, by contrast, is sketched more archetypically as the despairing young magician; her specific personality and contradictions under pressure remain thin. The final shift—Mira touching the coin and choosing belief—feels earned but could carry more visible ambivalence or cost on her side.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is clearly drawn as an “affectionate skeptic,” with her longing for connection at odds with her mistrust of intrusive tech, and her bodily reactions to the crystal ground that conflict well. Her history with the telepathy pills credibly motivates her caution and her hunger for an ethical alternative. The final decision to pursue a gentler method feels earned by the build-up of somatic recognition rather than arbitrary revelation. The main limitation is that the choice arrives with relatively little resistance or genuine risk on the page, keeping her arc from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s motivation—to study anomalies and then to take on the role of witness/voice—is clear and grows organically from her abilities and circumstances. Her interiority is specific to her sensory mapping gift and post-Sleep context, and her final shift in stance is earned. However, her emotional life stays largely within a single, reverent register; there’s little contradiction or visible cost to deepen the change. The arc lands, but with more serenity than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, worldview, and quiet stubbornness are clearly motivated and consistent, and the button work feels genuinely internalized rather than labeled. However, she faces little real pressure or contradiction; she is essentially right from the outset, so we don’t see much in the way of simultaneous opposing impulses or costly inner conflict. Her emotional life is largely inferred from the lyric description rather than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or error. The final “learning” feels more like articulation of what she already believes than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s core motivation (to complete the mission and test whether her courage survived) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is specific and characterful (“folded into itself like a letter never opened”). The scars, the basement convalescence, and her training all root her in a particular history. However, contradictory impulses in the climactic moment (fear vs. trust) are more told than dramatized; her choice to extend the pillbox comes a bit too smoothly on the page. The relationship dynamic with the other spy is evocative but under-pressured, with little status play or real clash before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coachman is clearly motivated, with a coherent inner life and a long-evolving promise that feels psychologically plausible. His attentiveness, relationship to the needle, and reinterpretation of his grandmother’s request all reveal a specific sensibility rather than a stock figure. However, his internal conflict remains fairly abstract; we don’t see a concrete, pressured moment where contradictory impulses truly clash on the page. The final stance feels earned but not hard-won in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is rich, specific, and consistent: a potter whose patience, gentleness, and “phototropic to kindness” orientation convincingly drive her choices. Her interiority is concrete and embodied in how she handles the lantern glass and reads the oasis. The internal conflict is relatively low-pressure and more contemplative than oppositional, so the final choice to carry the oasis’s memory home lands as a quiet endurance rather than a sharply tested renunciation. That subtlety works, but the lack of a more visibly costly, on-page dilemma keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is specific and credible: a “fire escape gardener” who holds her father’s tool as talisman gives us a textured sense of her history and coping style, and her choice to engage the grieving child rather than stay in private reverie feels motivated. Her emotional world is embodied in small actions (climbing down rungs, placing the gauge tooth in the girl’s hand) rather than summary labels. The girl is thinner—defined mostly by grief and receptivity—but still believable at this length. The final act of teaching her to plant the cutting is an earned extension of Maren’s own stance toward loss rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s grief, longevity, and role as “last witness” are vividly particular, and her motivations (to make sense of her burden, to move from isolation to some form of connection) are coherent and consistent. Her evolution at the end—from seeing extinct species as ghosts to ancestors—is credibly foreshadowed by the reincarnation memories and library work. Internal contradiction (solitude as both wound and resource) is present but could be dramatized more through in-scene micro-choices rather than largely through exposition. Still, for this length, her interiority is rich and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, habits, and worldview are sharply drawn and feel particular, and the link between her work and the nest’s spiral yields a credible inner shift. Motivation is clear throughout, but she rarely meets genuine resistance, so contradictory impulses under pressure don’t fully materialize. Her final realization and decision to build the installation are motivated, yet the cost of that choice (exposure, loss of secrecy) remains mostly implied rather than embodied. Overall she reads as specific and alive, but her arc is more graceful slide than fraught change.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s vocation, competence, and sense of duty are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—staying up all night, risking the equipment—track logically with those traits. However, she encounters little genuine internal friction or doubt; once she identifies the problem, the path forward is essentially linear. Emotional textures skew abstract (“cautiously hopeful,” “ethereal grit”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular sensations. The ending shift from hopeful to “steadier and more resilient” is plausible but feels somewhat declared rather than earned through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s fear versus stubborn will is clear and embodied (“pressed her palm against the cold stone wall… mounting panic”), and her bond with her grandfather gives her motive real weight. Her core change—reframing the tunnels from prisons to “passages of possibility”—is earned by what we’ve seen. However, the narrative leans on label-speak like “prudently adventurous” and “claustrophobic explorer,” and the closing recap of her traits flattens some nuance. A bit more contradiction or cost in her choices under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is sharply defined through her prosopagnosia, methodical ritual, and personal history with her mother, and her vocation feels psychologically plausible. Her motivation—to translate emotional residue into portraits that grant peace—is clear and consistently expressed in action (setting up the canvas, reading the ribbon, painting). However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched; her tension between wanting justice and accepting that she can only offer closure is mostly stated rather than dramatized under pressure. A slightly deeper on-page struggle or cost at the end would push this character work into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s motives are clear, specific, and rooted in family history, professional frustration, and ethical hunger, and her final stance feels earned by what she uncovers. The copper nail habit, her decryption skill, and her long tenure in the archives all individualize her. Internal conflict between institutional safety and ancestral loyalty is present but could be sharpened by one more concrete moment of hesitation or complicity. Overall, she reads as a fully realized person within the constraints of the length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fiddler’s history and vocation are vivid and particular, and her sensitivity to liminal spaces (bridges, tunnels, pullouts) coherently underpins her response to the hitchhiker. Her shaken but composed reaction to the disappearance feels emotionally believable, if a bit under-contested. The major shift—reframing her bridge-playing as making space for “impossible testimony”—is thematically earned by prior details. What’s missing at this tier is more dramatized internal contradiction or visible struggle around accepting the glass’s vision and her new role.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is sharply drawn through his father’s legacy and his translation of “territory” into the startup world, and Elena has a distinct presence with her “perceptively calm” surface and brittle laugh. Their motives are clear—he wants to preserve the integrity of what they built; she wants escape from failure—but genuine inner contradiction under pressure is only lightly hinted at rather than dramatized. The final choice (resist acquisition, keep team, dissolve company) is emotionally and philosophically motivated and feels earned. A bit more embodied stress or messy irrationality in both of them under this decision would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, habits, and long history with both stars and dreams give her a distinct, coherent interior life, and her final decision to write “for all who would come after” is emotionally motivated by that history. However, internal conflict is fairly soft: she moves from “always known this moment would come” to acceptance with little friction, so the cost of changing from solitude to shared burden is more stated than felt. Emotions skew abstract rather than bodily, which slightly flattens her under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to atone for hubristic failure and save the orchard—is clear, consistent, and rooted in specific traits (guardedness, chosen solitude, guardian role). Interiority is textured and embodied in his physical ritual and in how he relates to the ice as “confession,” though the emotional conflict is weighted more toward reflection than live contradiction on the page. His change—accepting failure as shaping rather than defining him—feels earned by the work he does and the costs he accepts to repair it. The absence of any on-page relational crucible slightly limits complexity, keeping his flaw and growth somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The visionary’s rooted constraint, long apprenticeship in stillness, and drive to “heed the old call” are clear and particular, and her final choice feels organically motivated. Her “purposefully curious” nature is shown via decades of observation, not just told. However, internal conflict is relatively soft: fear and elation are named but never truly threaten to derail her acceptance, so the cost of choosing is more implied than dramatized. The character remains compelling but not yet psychologically knotty enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and specific—trading three years of her happiest memories to free her sister’s spirit is both coherent and extreme, and it shapes every choice she makes in the orchard. Her “fiercely gentle resolve” and awareness of the cost (“burned-out spaces where joy used to live”) give her interiority texture and contradiction rather than simple martyrdom. The final endurance—accepting her sister’s partial return and her own permanent loss—reads as an earned stasis with clear cost. The sister’s apparition is lightly sketched but appropriate for the length and function.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete habits (the grille cloth, the way he reads brasses and dovetails), and his grief/fear vs. longing for purpose is credibly contradictory on the page. His final decision to drive to Elko feels fully earned by his history and current shame, not like a neat epiphany. Emotions are mostly embodied via objects and sensory recall rather than labels. A few abstract phrases (“the silence that had swallowed him”) skim toward summary but don’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is specific, textured, and motivated, with her scholarly patience, haunted ambition, and quiet shift from craving a monumental discovery to accepting the role of conduit. Her emotions are embodied in select places (the weeping, the physical journey’s toll), but most conflict is held at a reflective distance rather than dramatized in live contradictory impulses. Her final inner reorientation is well earned by prior setup, though the lack of on-page resistance or messy irrationality slightly flattens the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Asa is vividly sketched—her bronze limbs, ancient patience, and mechanical heart create a distinctive presence—but she never faces a real test or contradiction that forces a new choice. Her motivation to tend and preserve identities is clear and consistent, yet it remains more stated than dramatized under pressure. The piece leans on role and atmosphere rather than on interior conflict or change. As a result, she feels emblematic more than fully alive in a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margret is grounded in her professional history and worldview, and her shift from material inspection to emotional insight feels earned by what she encounters. The hesitation at the pool shows a live micro-conflict, but her ultimate decision comes a bit quickly and cleanly, with limited sense of genuine risk or self-contradiction. Emotional states are mostly shown through perception and setting rather than labeled. The lack of real cost or complicating flaw at the end keeps this below top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is specific and embodied (the tremor, the way she handles the accordion, how the graffiti “settled into her chest like stones”). Her motivation—seeking something the rivers and this place can teach her post-breakdown—remains consistent and deepens toward a stance of earned, tentative self-forgiveness. Contradictory impulses (self-blame vs. desire to continue field work / to carry the accordion but not play it) are present but could be pushed into sharper, riskier conflict to fully exploit the piece’s emotional stakes. The final endurance/renunciation (not playing, just holding; accepting flooding) feels earned and costs her the fantasy of neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer’s motive (finding the library) is clear, longstanding, and consistently dramatized through her actions and observations. Her emotional life is embodied (trembling fingers, watch against ribs), but internal contradiction and genuine dilemma are muted—she rarely faces a choice with real downside. The connection to her con-man grandfather gives a nice specific quirk but remains mostly backstory flavor rather than a crucible. The final “change” is more situational (she arrives) than a hard-earned internal shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s professional identity, plant-telepathy, and buried musical desire create a specific, textured interiority, and her conflicting futures (empire of knowledge vs. making music) are clearly dramatized. Her micro-choices—brewing coffee, consulting visions, listening to the wisteria, then lifting the bow—track cleanly with those motives. The contradiction between caution and longing is present in-scene rather than summarized. The only ceiling is that the final “choice” leans more toward a charged tilt than a fully dramatized, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s vocation, lineage, and reverent competence are specific and convincing, and her micro-choices (how she moves, works, and reads the spark) align cleanly with her motives. What’s missing at this level is genuine internal friction or contradictory impulse under pressure—she never doubts, hesitates, or pays an emotional price beyond abstract “responsibility.” The result is a textured but relatively untested interiority. A stronger sense of what this work costs her personally would lift the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and interior life are clear and specific: her history with Aldric, her commitment to the grotto, and her restless search for contentment all feel coherent and rooted in concrete past choices (especially the forgiveness scene). Her internal contradiction—peace after forgiveness yet ongoing hollowness—is well-articulated, though it remains largely contemplative rather than dramatized under live pressure. The final shift in her stance toward “contentment as tending” is credibly earned by the repeated tree-climbing pattern. The main limitation is that most key conflicts and decisions (forgiving Aldric) occur in summarized backstory rather than under present-tense strain, which mutes the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply drawn: her profession, methods, and “cloak of doubt” read specific and internally consistent, and her blend of weariness and conviction feels earned. The recap of Thomas shows her under pressure indirectly, revealing how she leverages performance to reach truth. Her small internal turn—recognizing that her own compass still points true—lands credibly but with modest cost. The piece leans a bit on abstract/therapy-adjacent language instead of fully embodied contradiction in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mina’s desire and receptivity are clear, and her final act of throwing her own stone is a motivated, meaningful stance shift. The researcher is archetypal but coherent, with his refusal/withholding strategy embodied in his behavior. Emotional texture leans more contemplative than conflicted, so we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The change at the end feels earned but could carry more on-page ambivalence or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stone skimmer is specific and credible as an ancient, patient navigator, with motives (to read and guard the canyon through stillness) that are clear and consistent. Her relationship to the arrowhead, the birds, and the dust makes her feel situated in a long lineage rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is muted: there’s little real friction between sanctuary and prison beyond a single line of doubt, so endurance costs feel more implied than dramatized. The final “peace” reads earned in mood, but not tested by any acute on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and consistent—the underachieving, systems-oriented mage whose quiet, steady competence primes her for this revelation is convincing. Her fascination with the keystone and reluctance to report the error feel like credible micro-choices. However, she encounters remarkably little friction: contradictory impulses under pressure and felt cost are muted, so the final revaluation of herself feels earned but low-stakes. The piece implies long-term deprivation, but the on-page moment doesn’t force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained across years, and his internal arc—from forcing a revelation to receiving it—is credible and earned. The detail of him “hiding behind truth” gives him a lived-in, slightly evasive psychology, though that trait doesn’t significantly complicate his on-page choices. Emotional embodiment is mostly through perception of light and water rather than bodily sensation, but it feels character-specific rather than generic. The final realization reads motivated by his long pattern of behavior, not as a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s vocation, inheritance from her grandmother, and contemplative temperament are clear and consistent, and her final realization is motivated by what we’ve seen of her. However, emotional life is largely abstracted—there’s little embodied tension or contradictory impulse on the page, and almost no sense of personal risk. The grandmother functions more as a mythic influence than as a relationship under pressure. The endurance choice at the end (to continue witnessing) is credible but carries only a faintly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Melencolia’s interiority is specific and textured—her numb professional role versus the forbidden, resurfacing grief for Elias gives her a credible contradiction. Her motive “to work—to name the fears that haunted the dying” is cleanly reweighted once the recordings personalize that mandate. The final shift (“not quite a heart but was enough”) feels earned by prior beats rather than a sudden revelation. The only limit is that her struggle unfolds smoothly, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mage’s motivation is clear, rooted in a long-standing sense of inadequacy and a newfound purpose tied to his father and the village’s survival. His “lukewarm” limitation becoming a specific advantage is a strong character-specific twist. However, internal contradiction is mild—he doesn’t truly struggle with doubt or competing impulses once he begins, so the emotional path is relatively straight. The endurance and quiet commitment at the end read earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation, history with the drowned town, and response to resurfacing artifacts build a coherent, specific psychology, and her choice to volunteer for this duty feels motivated and right-scaled. The link between her professional acuity (“trained to read water's intentions”) and her emotional agenda is elegant. What’s missing at a top-tier level is active internal contradiction under pressure—she never seriously wavers or reveals a cost-laden counter-impulse. The line “Her motivation was not simply archival—she spin stories into shared meaning…” edges toward thesis rather than dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and rooted in her lifelong tension between calculation and wonder, and her weeping at the end feels earned by the preceding meditations. Her motivation (to reconcile logic and intuition) is clear and consistent, and her actions with the crystal and flame track that drive. However, the piece leans more on lyrical reflection than dramatized micro-choices under pressure, so contradictory impulses rarely collide in a truly fraught way on the page. The “scientist’s mask” shattering is strong, but the cost of that shift is mostly abstract rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—protecting Elena and honoring her trust—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through watchfulness, recalculation, and ritual (the buckle). We get an embodied sense of his anxiety via physical tics rather than labels, which helps. However, his interiority remains relatively single-note (dutiful, hyper-competent, self-effacing); conflicting impulses under pressure are hinted at but not deeply dramatized. The ending functions as earned stasis, but the cost paid (stress and vigilance) could be more sharply individuated and fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to break through numbness—is clear and consistently drives choices, especially the decision to use the blade on the clone. Internal conflict between resorting to violence and seeking connection is present but often rendered in abstract terms (“ego death,” “emotional numbness”) rather than fully embodied ambivalence. The clone functions more as a thematic foil and mouthpiece than as a richly individuated character, though their warmth and belief in connection sharpen the contrast. The final reconfiguration—from seeing the clone as an object/tool to recognizing them as a complement—feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and grounded in her profession, with the escape room background giving her a credible, character-particular way of interpreting the seed. Her motivation (to protect unconventional innovation) is clear and consistent, and her actions—planting the seed, redesigning rooms—align with that. Internal conflict (market pressure vs. her ideals, impatience vs. patience) is present but mostly summarized rather than put under sharp on-page test. The final realization is earned but leans reflective rather than dramatized through a difficult, felt choice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conductor’s motivation and purpose are clear and consistent, and his ritualistic approach to the work gives him some specificity. However, he remains more emblem/role than fully individuated person; we don’t see genuine contradiction or a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional texture is largely summarized in abstract terms of grief and purpose rather than embodied in idiosyncratic reactions. The ending preserves his stance (endurance) but without a sharply felt personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guardian’s inner life is specific and textured—“dimensionally homesick” and her feral custodianship feel particular rather than generic. Her long-term waiting and final decision to move forward are motivated by this ache and her relationship to the garden. However, the decisive act (walking into the mist) arrives with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse at the moment of choice, so the change costs less than it could. The emotions are vivid but skew abstract rather than fully embodied in concrete sensations and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation and long-haul obsession are clear and specific, and her final act of snapping the crozier again is well-earned by the prior seventeen years of failure. We get a strong sense of her temperament—dogged, reflective, “stoically sensitive”—through her methodical experimentation. However, internal contradiction under pressure is only lightly sketched; she moves fairly cleanly from belief to realization without much dramatized ambivalence in the present scene. Emotional texture trends more conceptual than embodied, which slightly blunts the impact of her breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, temperament, and method are clearly individualized, and her choice to “tune” to the silence instead of measuring it is a credible, character-driven pivot. Her emotional experience is embodied enough (the sway of the tower, the weeping) to feel lived. However, internal conflict is muted—she adapts very quickly to the invitation of the silence with little doubt, fear, or genuine struggle on the page. The final “I’ve learned this great truth” shift feels somewhat gifted rather than hard-won, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maren is vivid and specific—her comfort with “permanent transience,” her preference for an empty hourglass, and her competence with the ferry’s strangeness all feel grounded. However, her “resilient positivity” functions mostly as a stable trait rather than a source of real internal friction; we don’t see contradictory impulses (fear vs duty, self-preservation vs obligation) actively collide in the climactic choice. Her decision to become the nexus is motivated and consistent, but reads almost too easy given the described risk of being “scattered across a dozen realities.” The endurance at the end feels earned, yet the emotional cost of that endurance is under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The architect’s vocation, philosophy (“rational enchantment”), and creeping self-erasure are sharply drawn and consistent. Her main on-page choices—continuing to weave through the “eruption” and then accepting a sleepless vigil amid her threads—fit her obsessive, controlled temperament. However, we see more articulated belief than embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure; her internal conflict about memory distortion stays largely conceptual. A slightly more dramatized moment of hesitation or cost around continuing the work would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is clearly motivated—rooted in family history, vocation, and curiosity—and her anchor link grounds her emotionally in a specific way. Her interiority is particular rather than generic, especially in how she frames navigation and connection. However, we don’t see much genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; she moves serenely from question to realization. The closing stance feels earned but relatively low-cost and untested by real resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is sharply sketched as a practiced professional whose compassion and methodical habits align with her role; Vera, though brief on the page, feels specific and textured. Elena’s motivation—to offer action and protection to the grieving—is clear and consistent, and her curiosity-driven choice to push past the heartbeat is well grounded in her established nature. However, her internal conflict under pressure is relatively muted; she rarely feels genuinely torn or at risk, which softens the impact of her final realization. The late reframing of her job as “protecting vulnerable voices” is earned enough but leans toward summarizing her arc rather than dramatizing an on-page, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s core drivers—claustrophobia, scientific curiosity, and loyalty to Elara—are clear and consistent, and the final choice to dissolve into the network is motivated by those traits. The brief but concrete embodiment of her fear (“tightening her chest despite the vast ocean”) grounds her. However, the internal struggle at the climax feels comparatively quick and underdeveloped; the pull to stay outweighs the terror with little on-page friction. A touch more contradictory impulse under pressure would make the sacrifice of her human life land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete habits (heartbeat counting, ink ritual) and the morgue backstory gives her a credible, scarred psyche. Her arc from long-nursed anger toward a more complex understanding of the architect is motivated and legible. The main limitation is that her contradictory impulses (rage vs. empathy) are more summarized than dramatized in present-time micro-choices, which slightly flattens peak emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—ending a generational curse and midwifing a new language from a dying one—is clear, specific, and sustained, and her copper-veined, quietly articulate nature feels particular. However, her inner life remains largely unconflicted: she is resolute and competent throughout, with little sense of doubt, fear, or competing impulses under pressure. The ancestral bargain is invoked more as inherited weight than as a live moral bind she might resist or misinterpret on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (to understand what happened to Amari and what the creature really is) is clear and consistent, and her interior lens on academia’s dismissal feels specific. Her emotional reactions—fear, wonder, loyalty—are embodied enough to feel real, though sometimes summarized in slightly generic terms (“fear and wonder warring in her chest”). Amari’s characterization via voice is intriguing but more thesis-driven than person-driven, which flattens him a bit into a thematic mouthpiece. The final step “into the harmony untamed” is earned but its cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to recover a lost, meaningful note of beauty in a mechanized world—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (crossing the bridges, picking up the shell, choosing to play) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorially rich, especially around the locust shell, but her inner life remains largely unconflicted; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. Her key “choice” to play feels inevitable rather than hard-won, which mutes the emotional cost of the change she undergoes. The statues register as a collective presence rather than characterized others, so relational pressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is sharply defined as a principled, quietly defiant mailman whose choices clearly align with his values, and Aram reads specific and credible in his brief appearance. Motivation is strong—he serves people over regimes—but internal conflict is muted; he never seems genuinely torn or afraid despite the risk. His role as emotional courier (the sisters, Vera, Aram’s grandmother) gives him depth, but we don’t see contradictory impulses tugging at him in the moment. The final self-recognition is emotionally apt yet comes a bit easily given the lack of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carpenter’s worldview and temperament are clear and particular—someone who “knew wood the way others knew words” and treats silence as invitation, not void. His actions align coherently with that nature (reading the bells as a sign, moving slowly, responding with a wordless song). However, he experiences little visible internal conflict; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a felt cost to his enduring solitude or to accepting this “calling.” The final shift into purpose is graceful but emotionally low-contrast, which limits depth at a top-tier standard.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam is sharply sketched—her odd hours, hyperbolic-theory obsession, and reverence for analog memories feel specific and consistent, and her decision to perform the ritual is clearly motivated. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance; there’s little sense of risk beyond a generalized solemnity. Internal contradiction is minimal—she never wavers between competing impulses. The stranger is more a function than a character, so relational pressure is light.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s inner life is specific and grounded in concrete habits—odd hours, patient restoration, stubborn affection—so her eventual fixation on the “runaway dream” feels earned. Her motivation shifts credibly from caretaking the library to tending the dreams in the photographs and finally recognizing her own longing. The cost is quiet but legible: she accepts a life defined by this ache reframed rather than resolved. Internal contradiction is subtle (caretaker vs. seeker) rather than dramatized in sharp on-page conflict, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s motivation and inner life are clear and particular—her years of “quiet flight,” doubt, and stubborn persistence all track cleanly into the final fulfillment. The internal tension between near-madness and faith in the star/hair key is strong but remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in live micro-choices. No other character appears on the page to complicate her, which limits relational and status dynamics. The final shift into earned rest is credible and rooted in the prior portrayal, if somewhat emotionally underplayed in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a seasoned, hands-on folklorist whose curiosity, professional history, and personal loss all cohere into a clear motive for diving back into this site. His emotional arc—from controlled empiricist to a man weeping underwater as his grandmother’s face returns—feels earned. The main tension is between his methodological skepticism and his need to believe in the ring, but that conflict is mostly resolved by the time the scene opens, so contradiction under peak pressure is present but not maximally exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren is sharply etched: the backward-walking habit, the shard-mirror archivist role, and her choice of combative tenderness over comfort all feel specific and internally consistent. Her history of "reversible exile" and decision to stay as guardian gives clear motivation that aligns with every micro-choice in the scene. The children are sketched economically yet vividly—the girl’s defiant chin and the boy’s shrinking posture convey their states without cliché. The closing beat, where Maren interprets the boy’s sip as a “battle won,” registers as an earned, if quiet, change in their relational dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role, history, and purpose are clear and consistent, and her vocation feels particular rather than generic. However, she faces almost no on-page resistance or internal contradiction; she wants to do this work and simply does it. Her emotions stay in a narrow band of reverent competence, so we don’t see her under real pressure. The final act of planting reads as fulfillment of an established desire with little visible cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s vocation, lineage, and grief are cleanly motivated and her choice to complete the unbinding reads as an earned extension of who she is. The brief flash of her as a child on the shore retroactively deepens her investment without feeling tacked on. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—she’s competent and calm more than actively torn, so the pressure never fully destabilizes her. That keeps the psychology convincing but slightly limits the intensity of the crucible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s professional lens and temperament (“perceptive map framer,” “methodically curious”) are clear and consistent, and her decision to leave the chamber untouched is psychologically motivated. However, her interiority leans abstract and essayistic, with little embodied emotion or contradiction on the page; curiosity and reverence align rather than truly clash. The cost of her restraint is only lightly felt, more declared than dramatized. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully vivid or cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Miriam is sharply drawn as someone whose intimacy with the deep and with loss has become a defining trait, and her decision to find Eleanor’s daughter feels like a natural extension of that. Her interiority is precise rather than generic (“Death had become an old colleague…”), and her reactions to the globe and note reveal a clear value hierarchy. The main limitation is that her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized—she never quite has to choose between rival impulses on the page. Still, the closing resolve to deliver the message and perhaps “let go of the ocean” reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s longing to be heard and her instant recognition of the ghost’s patterns create a coherent, specific interior, and the shared balladeer backstory with the ghost gives her a clear emotional spine. Her motivation to serve as conduit is strong and consistent, but she rarely experiences real internal contradiction or hesitation; she’s almost entirely aligned with her task. The ghost’s past life as a balladeer layers motivation well but remains mostly expositional rather than dramatized in tension with Mira’s present choices. The final act of singing with the ghost feels earned, though the cost is more implied than strongly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is cleanly drawn—dutiful, curious, low-status—and her pivotal choice (to pry open the compartment and then to keep the secret) follows naturally from those traits. Her interior conflict over privacy versus curiosity is present but resolves quickly, so we don’t fully see contradictory impulses grinding against each other. Jansen is only seen through his handwriting, yet grief and hidden tenderness register credibly. The final stance—carrying his secret without announcing her knowledge—feels earned and character-consistent but not deeply risked.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam’s grief, scientific rigor, and inherited connection to flight are clearly and coherently motivated, and her choice to work in the gondola rather than on land feels character-specific. The interiority is textured—categorizing clouds emotionally, mistrusting gravity, gripping the telescope as an anchor—rather than generic. The shift from raw loss to a deliberate act of memorialization (the “catalog of emotional weather”) is credible and earned. The only limitation is that her internal conflict (science vs superstition, safety vs compulsion) stays relatively smooth, with few sharply dramatized contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s perception-driven identity (face blindness, pattern affinity) is vividly rendered and cleanly motivates her acceptance of the commission and her method. However, she faces little internal contradiction or emotional friction; she moves from task to completion with calm competence. Her stakes feel largely intellectual and aesthetic rather than personally fraught. The final realization about “limits” lands more as an abstract insight than as the endpoint of a dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization is clear, specific, and consistent: the blend of disciplined apprenticeship, inherited fascination (the grandmother’s phrasebook), and compulsive curiosity feels lived-in. Her motives for pursuing the pattern and wanting to impress Thresh are legible and drive her choices. However, internal contradiction under pressure is soft—she never truly wavers, and fatigue is acknowledged but not dramatized as a contested cost. The arc ends in affirmation rather than any difficult renunciation, which limits depth at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thessa’s motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks the “rhythm of repair” and follows the prophecy into the hall of mirrors. We get a distinct interior lens (reverent, tactile, craft-focused), but her emotional range stays narrow and largely serene. The key choice—sacrificing the gears—comes without visible hesitation or contradictory impulse, so it reads more ceremonial than pressured. Her final transformation into “keeper of celestial mechanics” feels earned but low-cost, more a natural elevation than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira as a presence is evocative and consistent, and Eli and Lena get just enough specific detail to feel like people rather than types, but interiority is kept at a distance by the omniscient, summarizing mode. Motivations (Mira’s push toward the valley, the community’s survival focus) are coherent yet rarely dramatized as live internal conflict in the moment. The “change” at the end—collective restoration and ringing the bell—feels earned but low-cost emotionally, more affirmation than hard-won shift. Relationships function more as community archetype than crucible with sharp, individuated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s role, history, and core motivation—to witness and preserve beauty at the edge of endings—are vividly and consistently rendered. Her emotional state is embodied in gestures like kissing the puppet and in how she reads the clock. However, internal contradiction is muted: she largely accepts her duty without much on-page tension between competing impulses. The final stance feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s reluctance and inherited duty are cleanly established (“more like a transfer of weight than a loss”), and her competence under pressure feels earned rather than convenient. Her internal conflict (resenting the role yet acting to save the travelers) is present but underplayed; the final choice doesn’t force a visibly new cost so much as reiterate her ongoing burden. Embodied emotion shows in small, particular touches (the child’s exhausted crying stirring her “reluctant heart”), though her affect stays cool. Strong, but not yet psychologically piercing enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s guilt, scientific mindset, and love for her mother interlock into a specific, convincing interior life, and her core contradiction—rational understanding vs. irrational guilt—is well dramatized. Her decision to come to the ravine, how she handles the chrysalis, and the reframing of her past choice all feel earned. The emotional turn from self-recrimination to a more complex acceptance is credible and carries cost (the grief persists, just altered). A slight safety lies in how cleanly the realization arrives, with little mess or backsliding on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s motive (to find where stories begin and refine her “quantifying absence” method) is clear and consistent, and her final reframing of her work reads as an earned conceptual shift. However, interiority remains mostly abstract and essayistic, with little embodied emotion or contradictory impulse on the page. Her choices (selecting bottles, observing, concluding) don’t carry much visible cost, so the arc feels more like a graceful thought experiment than a pressured change in a person.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Miriam’s gift, weariness, and grim professionalism are sharply drawn, and her decision to take on the pavilion’s burden feels like a natural extension of three decades of coping with other people’s pain. Her motivation to “be the sandpaper” is clearly articulated through action—choosing to work rather than flee after first contact. The internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we’re told she’s burdened and reclusive, but don’t see many moments of genuine temptation to stop once the work begins. Still, the final sense of being “both stronger and more fragile” is an earned endurance, with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply drawn as a quietly forceful bridge-builder, with her history as choral librarian and community mediator giving her choices weight and coherence. Motivation is clear and rooted in long practice rather than a sudden conversion. However, her inner conflict is underplayed—she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses, which slightly flattens what could be a more complex interior arc. Secondary figures (Antonescu, his brother) are effective but mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s “helix-minded” cognition and frustrated-innovator backstory give her a specific, credible profile, and her absorption in the mirror reads as consistent with that temperament. However, her shift from engineer on a thinking walk to self-anointed “archeologist of abandoned dreams” happens very quickly, with little on-page ambivalence or resistance. The line “she felt her synaptic pathways reorganize themselves” outsources struggle to a quasi-magical neurological event rather than dramatized conflict. The change feels conceptually motivated more than psychologically hard-won, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Calyx’s obsession and professional identity are clearly motivated and consistent, and her interiority feels specific to an archivist who “sees like a prism.” However, her internal conflict at the key junction (fear vs. obsession) is mostly told rather than dramatized, and she encounters little real resistance once she chooses the left passage. The final shift—seeing the patterns as a beginning rather than an end—is earned but carries limited on-page emotional cost. This keeps the characterization strong but short of deeply cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply sketched through vocation and perception—“tree-song sculptor” and her way of reading branch structures as chords feel specific and alive. Her motivation to coax music from a silent world is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (venturing deeper, repurposing the insulator, building and playing the instrument) all track with that drive. What’s missing for top-tier characterization is genuine internal friction or a choice with visible cost; she meets no real resistance and harbors no contradictory impulses on the page. The result is compelling but emotionally low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s exile, precision, and relationship with the queen create a specific, coherent psychology, and his rituals with the stone and the nexus reveal character under quiet pressure. Motivation (to continue his vocation in another form) is clear and consistent. However, on-page internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; contradictory impulses don’t quite clash in scene so much as get summarized. The final endurance choice (to keep waiting/teaching in silence) is earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motives and worldview are clear, particular, and consistent, and her refusal of force in favor of frequency work is well earned by the backstory of cataloguing silences. Her interiority is concrete and character-specific, especially in how she reads different silences as distinct pitches. Internal contradiction is quieter—she never really wavers from her pacifist stance—so the sense of struggle is more implied than dramatized. The closing reconfiguration (understanding empathy as losing sounds) feels earned but carries relatively low visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kalia’s ambition, sensitivity, and inherited rituals give her a distinct, believable interior life, and her realization at the end is clearly earned from months of aversion and tending. The contradiction between drive and required stillness is present, though often summarized rather than dramatized in specific hard choices. Emotional responses are embodied through smell and small actions more than abstract labels. The final shift—ambition reorganizing into a truer form—lands, but the personal cost remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cora’s curiosity, professionalism, and ethical restraint are clearly and consistently rendered, and her reactions to the inversion and the artifact feel grounded in a specific history (“eleven seasons”). The decision to leave the arrow where it is is motivated and fits the established values. However, there is very little real internal conflict on the page; she moves fairly smoothly from curiosity to reverent protection. The resolution thus reads as principled but not deeply contested, which limits emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is distinctly drawn—competent, methodical, with a professional history that plausibly informs how she reads the world. Motivation (to understand and document the causes of catastrophe) is coherent and drives every on-page choice. What’s missing at this level is embodied contradiction or visible emotional cost; she never has to choose between competing values or impulses. The result is strong but somewhat one-note characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    Yara’s vocation, gift, and goal are clear and specific, and her emotional responses (awe, pressure, frozen tears) feel grounded in the world’s logic. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and we see little in-scene contradiction or doubt to complicate her devotion to the task. Her final “change” is largely confirmation of what she already believes, minimizing felt cost. The characterization is strong for this length but not yet at a deeply conflicted or transformative level.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s guilt, history, and self-reproach are cleanly motivated, and her choice of route, markers, and vigil all arise plausibly from that mindset. The internal contradiction—guardian as actor vs. guardian as witness—is present and paid off in the final reframing. However, much of this is articulated in reflective summary rather than dramatized through on-page, pressured micro-choices. The emotional trajectory feels believable but slightly too tidy and essayistic for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    Maren’s interiority is vivid and particular—the widow’s ring, child’s toy, and dog tag all refract who she is and what she values. Her motivation (to formalize the “mathematics of emotion”) is clear and consistent. However, she faces little on-page opposition or genuine dilemma; she moves toward dissolution with near-complete equanimity, so contradictory impulses and visible cost are muted. The final “change” feels more like a serene consummation than a pressured, character-testing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her jitters, the pendant as surrogate for Mira, and the way grief closes her throat all feel embodied and rooted in history. Her shift from anxious courier to someone who accepts being “a courier not just of objects but of possibilities” is earned by the visionary encounter. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively soft: her doubts do not generate difficult micro-choices so much as dissolve under Mira’s reassurance. Mira herself functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and textured—her practice, her relationship with her grandmother, and her evolving understanding of the arbor all feel character-particular rather than generic mysticism. Her core motivation (to prove emotional residue in objects) is consistent and drives her ritual behavior. The final realization that she is becoming part of the place is earned by prior setup, though the internal conflict between scientist/prover and mystic/participant could be sharpened in on-page contradiction. Emotional states are mostly embodied, but occasionally drift toward conceptual summary rather than dramatized struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The loom spinner’s motivation—fulfilling a generational obligation and reaching the grandmother—is clear and consistent, and the final self-sacrifice is causally earned. However, her interiority leans abstract (“geometry and grief”) over embodied contradiction, so the moment of deciding to give up “the one thing she had kept protected” feels more graceful than conflicted. We get little sense of the specific life, memories, or desires she is renouncing beyond her role as spinner. The result is strong but not yet piercingly personal characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cael is sharply etched as a modest, overlooked craftsman whose shift from cherishing beauty to repurposing it for survival feels grounded and specific. His motivation to keep working in the mines, despite others’ abandonment and dismissal, is consistent and believable. What’s slightly missing at this echelon is a felt simultaneity of contradictory impulses under pressure—his perseverance is admirable but rarely in live conflict with fear, resentment, or despair on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s interiority is specific and coherent, with her vocation and the shard-linked wound shaping how she thinks and feels. Her motivation—to understand what happened to her mentor and to herself—is clear and sustained, and the final repricing (“not peace, but purpose”) feels earned. Internal conflict exists (gift vs. wound, escape vs. acceptance) but rarely surfaces as sharp, simultaneous impulses inside a single beat. The cost of her final stance is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, which keeps this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren is sharply etched—reticent, observant, carrying inherited grief—and her actions (reading the stones, offering the sea glass, stacking her own cairn) align cleanly with those traits. Her internal conflict (duty vs. unarticulated mourning) is present but relatively smooth, with little real resistance or ambiguity at the peak choice. Ashford is thin but functional as a pressure source and lore-bearer. The final shift toward purpose feels earned, if a touch tidy for elite-level nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s vocation, joy, and quiet burden are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices around tending the wick and speaking/laughing feel rooted in that identity. However, internal contradiction stays mostly implied (burden vs. joy) rather than dramatized in on-page friction or difficult choices. Emotions are largely conveyed via tone and imagery, not embodied reaction under pressure. The ending endurance (“his burden and his gift, his reason for remaining…”) is thematically apt but doesn’t land with a sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Yuen’s interiority is specific and grounded in his craft and recent surgery, and his core motivation—to understand why some people attract stories—feels coherent and character-based. The donor heart and his grandmother’s example personalize the abstract idea effectively. However, his internal turn from questioning to clarity is relatively smooth and tidy, with little on-page friction or contradiction, so the “cost” of his realization remains muted. The closing resolution (“he would return…changed by this understanding”) feels slightly declarative rather than wrestled into being.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The warden’s inner life is specific and credible—her long tenure, learned use of the sextant, and curiosity about what trees witness all feel rooted in a coherent temperament. However, she is largely defined by vocation and function rather than sharply individuated quirks or contradictions. We don’t see much genuine internal conflict or competing impulses under pressure; she is serenely competent throughout. The final stance (to maintain by partly unmaking) is motivated, but the emotional cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than felt through her body or psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core drive—to revive a dying realm via her own fragmented memory—is clear and consistently embodied in action, especially as she chooses to pour herself into the Heart-Tree. The scattered-memory aspect personalizes her perception but stays mostly at an archetypal level rather than showing messy, contradictory impulses in scene. Her final transformation (keeper of old memories → weaver of new ones) is earned and carries visible cost. The emotional experience is evocative but could use one sharper, more specific moment of hesitation or self-protective impulse to deepen conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific, with her “compassionate recluse” paradox dramatized through past overexposure to others’ pain and present withdrawal into the library. The keen empathy scenes (barista, child on bus, old man) give her motive real weight and cost. Her final decision—to answer the invitation tomorrow—feels credibly earned by her time in the Philosophy of Errors section and the liminal midnight moment. A slight tendency toward abstract self-diagnosis (“the accumulating mass had become a stone in her chest”) keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s characterization is rich, specific, and consistent—her attentiveness, ritualized care, and relationship to decay all feel lived-in and credible. Motivation (tending the tea house, transforming neglect, accepting/receiving absolution) is clear and aligned with her actions. The main limitation is the relative lack of active internal contradiction or on-page struggle: she rarely wavers, so the final endurance choice costs her less visibly than it could. A sharper clash between burden and desire, even in a quiet mode, would raise this.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—preserve then understand the vows—is clear, consistent, and particular to her vocation, and her micro-choices (how she moves, what she measures, how she reclassifies) align with that. Her "gently meticulous" nature is well-embodied in action rather than just label. The interior turn from dread of oblivion to embracing evolution reads plausible and earned. What keeps this below top-tier is the relative smoothness of that shift—there’s little sense of genuine inner resistance or contradictory impulse at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is specific, with a clear history in the market and a concrete emotional tether in the watch and her father. Her motives (answers vs. holding on to the last piece of him) are legible and play against each other in the final beat. The internal contradictions are present but could be pushed further into an on-page decision or visible slip. The scarred woman is effective as a pressure-exerting presence but remains mostly emblematic rather than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization as a skeptical yet bioluminescent observer is vivid and internally coherent, with clear tension between her scientific doubt and her susceptibility to wonder. Her motivation—to understand why some people “carry weather”—is cleanly established and pursued. The final conceptual shift toward embracing wonder feels earned, though the cost is largely internal and gently rendered. Seren is more archetypal than developed, serving mainly as catalyst rather than as a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is sharply etched: technically skilled, guilt-ridden, and self-limiting, with actions (coming to the cave, choosing to begin drawing) that grow credibly out of those traits. The relationship with Elena is rendered through specific memories and micro-cruelties rather than abstract guilt, which gives the interiority bite. The final shift—from viewing the painting as “her work” to an opportunity to “uncork” her own—feels earned by what we’ve learned. Some richer contradiction in Mira’s impulses in the final moment (hesitation vs. drive) could have added even more dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s inner life and motives are clear, specific, and grounded in her craft and history with her 师傅, and the discovery of his letters gives her final choice emotional weight. The calligrapher detail feels fully inhabited rather than decorative. However, her internal conflict around honesty versus “survival untruths” is more stated than dramatized—she never visibly hesitates or pays a concrete price for choosing candor, which softens the felt cost of her final act. The师傅 relationship is powerful but entirely retrospective, limiting on-page relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, history as a bell tuner, and post-Quieting role are specific and coherent, and her core motive—preserving the blue of ancient ice—is cleanly dramatized. Her actions align with that motive across the scene, especially in the detailed tuning of the sculpture and her embodied response to Juniper’s approval. However, internal contradiction and genuine pressure on her values are minimal; she mostly confirms what she already believes. Juniper functions as a gentle reflector rather than a source of real relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cara’s interiority is specific and textured—the rebuilt hands, the “circuit of her heart,” the static that feels like grief all individuate her. Her motivation as caretaker scales credibly from tending children to tending roses to absorbing their fears. The internal conflict between machine and “strangely organic” self is dramatized rather than explained. The final stance—accepting a “fragmented wholeness” after choosing to bear the fears—feels earned and not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s sensibility as a curator and listener is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (approaching the mailbox, waiting when beckoned, taking the letters into her work) align with that motivation. However, she is almost entirely without on-page flaw or contradiction, so we don’t see her under genuine pressure or in conflict with herself. Much of her arc (“she understood finally why she had been drawn to this work”) is delivered as explained realization rather than dramatized struggle. The relationship with Mrs. Okonkwo is warm but mainly expository, not a crucible that tests either woman.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation—turning enforced silence and captivity into an encoded path to liberation—is vivid and coherent, and her habits (the dice, the journal, the spider-web pattern) feel particular rather than generic. Her choices under pressure (to dance, to encode everything, to rig the lab years in advance) clearly arise from that psychology. What’s missing at this caliber is a sharper sense of live internal contradiction in the scene itself—she moves through this final return with near-total calm, so we don’t see fear, doubt, or anger tugging against her resolve in real time. The endurance arc is credible and earned, but emotionally a bit too smoothed over to feel fully three-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, relationship to her mother, and fixation on deleted memories are clear and consistent, and her final self-recognition as “lantern lighter of forgotten things” feels earned by prior images. Interiority is specific and filtered through her work habits (coffee grounds, docks), which gives her a distinct texture. However, her internal conflict remains relatively low-friction—she moves toward the crystal without serious hesitation or competing impulses on the page. The emotional cost of exhuming her mother and confronting the confession is asserted more in concept than dramatized through moment-to-moment micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The summoner’s goal and worldview are clear and specific—hushing a prophecy by treating it as frequency rather than fate gives her a distinct intellectual spine. Her emotional life is present but relatively steady; she moves from burdened to lucid without much on-page contradiction or messiness under pressure. The most interesting motivation beat is the reveal that the prophecy is a plea from a future self, which retroactively complicates her initial resistance. Still, the cost of her choice—what she risks in defying both prophecy and court—remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s mix of curiosity, unease, and growing dependence is well-motivated, and the tutor’s oblique answers and physical specificity (“eyes the color of old mortar,” the way she handles the seal) give her a strong, eerie presence without over-explaining. The internal conflict crystallizes cleanly at the interrogation moment—Elena’s desire to know versus her desire to keep the relationship and mystery intact. The final choice (“I don’t need to know”) feels earned by prior beats and forecloses a genuine path. The only limitation is that Elena’s broader life and flaws beyond this relationship remain off-page, keeping the characterization excellent but not yet fully multi-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific and credible: a scientist trained to skepticism yet secretly hungry for the very mystery she’s supposed to reject. Her micro-choices—returning to the garden, continuing to listen, reinterpreting the shell scientifically rather than magically—track cleanly with that tension. The inherited weight of Elena’s reputation adds a quiet but effective second pressure line. Her final commitment to “find the other half” is a believable extension of her arc, though the emotional cost of abandoning skepticism could be etched a touch more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Yuki’s motivation—to restore erased truths and step out of inherited complicity—is coherent and specific, with craft-linked details (calligraphy, forgery-as-restoration) grounding her. However, she faces little active resistance, and we rarely see genuinely conflicting impulses in the moment; her choices feel aligned and assured rather than pressured. The Archive Keeper is sketched intriguingly but functions more as thematic mouthpiece than active counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, history with the shell, and burdened gift give her a distinct, well-fleshed interiority, especially in lines like “she carried her gift like a wound that never fully healed.” Her motivation—to understand and possibly free the echo people—is clear and coherently threaded through the piece. However, we get little in-scene contradiction or hard micro-choices; she mainly arrives already decided and follows through without visible inner push-pull in the moment. The ending stance feels more like a continuation of her established drive than a sharply earned change with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist’s motive—salvaging a pure memory and giving the child back her name—is clear and consistent, but largely asserted rather than pressured on the page. Her interiority is textured in mood yet rarely contradictory; we don’t see competing impulses or a difficult trade-off, only serene commitment. Micro-choices (diving the wreck, tending the shrine, deciding to find the relatives) are all aligned and cost-light. The net effect is a strong atmosphere of purpose without the sharper edges of character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yuki’s characterization is specific and textured: a net-mender whose philosophy genuinely arises from her craft, with concrete professional habits (calloused fingers, pattern-reading) grounding the interiority. Her contradictory impulses—pleasure in remaining unseen as the architect of her father’s success, yet a longing to honor hidden effort—are dramatized rather than summarized. The choice to whistle like a child despite her self-consciousness is a believable, earned integration of those contradictions. Stakes stay modest, but her quiet shift toward embracing that “strangeness” feels credible and rooted in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply drawn as a seasoned debunker whose instincts and worldview clearly drive her choices, and the orchard keeper provides effective pressure and contrast. Her motivation—to gather fragments rather than buy into narratives—is specific and consistent. However, her internal conflict and emotional cost remain somewhat abstract; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a felt price for transmitting the truth. The final endurance choice (staying through the storm) is resonant but skims over what it personally costs her beyond professional satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly rendered as an exiled, stubbornly curious scientist-mystic, with concrete history (the Council, her grandmother, prior allegiances) and a distinct worldview. Her loneliness and skewed loyalty are well embodied in her actions—staying, listening, approaching the portico. Internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in present time, and the final “shift” into hope comes easily, without a strongly felt on-page cost or contradiction being actively confronted. The result is strong but not yet piercingly complex characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s interiority is specific and coherent—his obsession with jars, sounds, and language makes him feel distinct, and his shift from “collector of sounds” to “translator between generations” is credibly motivated by the music box encounter. His final renunciation of pure sound-collecting for contextual, relational work reads as an earned change with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that his epiphany arrives a bit smoothly, with limited on-page struggle or contradictory impulses in the decisive moment. The granddaughter functions more as a catalyst than a pressured relationship in her own right, keeping the relational crucible relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s motivation is clear and consistent (protect harbor, honor grandmother), and her competence under pressure reads convincingly. The tension between her logical training and visceral terror is present, though the internal contradiction stays relatively tidy rather than truly unruly. Embodied detail (cold key, groaning ice, exhaustion) grounds emotion. Her final state—drained but resolute—feels earned, if a bit straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kira has a clear vocation and history, and her long-term devotion to mapping gives her a coherent identity. However, her inner conflict—“sculpting patience from impatience”—is mostly told rather than dramatized in specific, pressured moments. The final “flowering” of the patient revolution feels more like a declared culmination than a hard-won, costed choice on the page. This keeps her from fully escaping archetype into a more singular, conflicted consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena is clear, competent, and particularized by her job, lineage, and frustration with Chen, and her final choice to circumvent him is consistent with these traits. The ancestor/lantern detail gives her a lived history rather than a stock investigator profile. However, the psychic memory download produces an instant, unambiguous certainty about Thomas and the conspiracy that flattens potential internal conflict or doubt. The emotional and ethical cost of defying Chen is gestured at but not deeply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Father Thomas’s interiority is specific and grounded in his dual roles; his hesitation over the repair and the choice to add a hidden inscription show motivated, value-driven micro-choices. The Marcus Webb memory deepens his conflict about what “repair” and grace mean without contradicting earlier traits. The emotional arc—from craftsman-priest to someone consciously making apology into action—is subtle but earned. A faint limitation is that his internal struggle never quite bites hard enough to feel costly, keeping this just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cart glider’s interiority is vivid, particular, and coherent, with the contrast between “built for transport” and obsessive translator of cosmic patterns giving the character real texture. Motivation—to decode the kaleidoscope language and ring the unheard bell—is clear and consistent. However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; there’s little on-page struggle or cost when choosing obsession over function. The final act of ringing the bell feels aligned with prior traits but not significantly pressured or contested.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s role and temperament are clear and specific, and her “brightly attentive” nature plausibly drives her pattern-recognition and descent into the archive. The sensed absence that “suddenly sharpened into something specific” is a good internal turn, but it remains more conceptual than embodied. Her conflict at the end (restore Yuki vs preserve absence) is stated rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses on the page. Yuki, as a distributed presence, is intriguingly sketched but never complicates Maren’s psychology beyond the investigatory drive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and specific—her understanding of peace, her comfort with “shadows,” and her practical concern about hunger all cohere into a distinctive moral psychology. Her choice at the end (to use fragments to see cracks in understanding rather than repair the crystal) is clearly rooted in this character. However, her internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we don’t feel a sharp on-page struggle or a visible cost to the decision beyond an implied burden. The piece could reach a higher tier with one concrete moment where her values pull her in competing directions with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motives and history (actuary, diagnosis, euthanasia trip) are specific and coherent, and the parasol tip gives her an anchoring, embodied relationship to life and legacy. Her internal conflict—between choosing departure and inheriting a lineage of endurance—is clear and poignant, especially in the grandmother passage. However, that contradiction is mostly processed in reflection rather than dramatized via difficult on-page choices; by the opening, her decision is already largely settled. The final choice to “go meet her own” feels earned but not sharply tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply realized: his vocation, history with Mira, and current emotional state all cohere, and his final acceptance clearly grows from traits established earlier. The internal conflict between duty to the vineyard and love for Mira is credible and persists as tension rather than being neatly solved. His endurance at the end reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost. A slight hedge is that his flaws (e.g., self-deception) could surface a bit more in present-time action rather than mostly in recollection.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation and worldview are clear and particular—she tends living boundaries, reads dune-murmurs, and trusts “peripheral awareness”—and these traits cohere into a convincing inner life. Her motivation to remember what the lines forget is grounded in concrete practices (walking the boundaries, consecrating clearings) rather than vague destiny. However, there’s little on-page internal contradiction or pressure; she doesn’t visibly struggle between competing impulses in the moment. The closing return to duty reads as endurance, but the cost of that endurance is more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s vocation and sensibility are clear, particular, and consistent—she “worked as vines climb,” and that metaphor coheres with every choice she makes on the page. Her motivation to tend broken images as a form of care is well established and never contradicted. However, there is little active internal conflict or contradictory impulse under pressure; she mostly enacts a stable philosophy. The final stance (collective healing as practice) is essentially what she began with, so the “change” is more affirmation than evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a reticent, obsessive scholar whose habits and perceptions feel specific and earned. His compulsion to take and then return the crystal tracks with his lifelong need to decode the library’s pattern. However, internal conflict stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. The final acceptance of silence reads as plausible but a touch summarized rather than pressured into being.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply drawn through specific habits (driftwood markers, chalk ritual) and a distinctive belief system as a “junkyard prophet.” Her flaw—precognitive forgetfulness—feels integrated rather than stapled on. The emotional arc from tidal longing to a quieter acceptance is credible though very interior and low-conflict. A bit more on how this gift tangibly costs her beyond frustration could deepen the sense of sacrifice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s grief, vocational identity, and perfectionism cohere into a clear psychology, and the final shift—reframing the spinning hand and his father’s absence—feels earned. Interiority is specific (“instruments of some quiet surgery,” the way he watches the hand instead of stopping it) and actions align with motives. Internal conflict between the urge to fix/stop and the emerging respect for motion is present, though not always dramatized moment-to-moment so much as described in reflection. The only ceiling is a slight reliance on stated insight rather than embodied contradiction at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply drawn—professional, newly terminal, and deliberately kind, with specific behaviors (calling the daughter, choosing objects) that align with her motives. Her interiority feels particular rather than generic, especially the way her diagnosis clarifies rather than collapses her. However, her internal conflict (terror vs serenity, self vs patient) remains more stated than dramatized in on-page contradictions. Margery is sketched efficiently but could exert more active pressure to expose Elara’s fault lines.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to prove herself and solve the shadow riddle) is clear, consistent, and drives her choices, especially in persisting with the key and the loops. Interiority is reasonably specific (“never wished more desperately to be worthy”), but her emotions remain mostly at a conceptual awe/excitement level rather than exposing sharper contradictions or vulnerabilities. Her final shift—from theoretical dependence on texts to embodied practice-based understanding—reads earned but comes without any visible cost beyond effort. The lack of internal conflict (fear of failure vs curiosity vs loyalty to mentor, etc.) keeps this shy of higher literary complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and credibly conflicted: guilt, love, resentment of the ministry, and a stubborn hope all coexist and drive her choices. Her refusal to identify the substitute body and her decision to enact a quasi-ritual with the tooth both feel organically motivated by that tension. The motherhood ambivalence (“fae creature learning to be human or a human child being slowly unmade”) is sharply rendered and underwrites the eventual self-forgiveness. The only limitation is that all conflict is internal and sometimes abstracted, which marginally softens the felt edge of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s longing, exile, and craft are rendered with convincing texture, and her shift from grief to purpose feels grounded in prior habits (the gem polishing) rather than deus ex machina. However, the internal conflict is mostly retrospective; in the present-time frame she moves fairly smoothly from realization to acceptance, with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse. The result is emotionally persuasive but a bit too tidy for top-tier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and particular—contradictory feelings toward the mother (“betrayal…confusion…quiet pride”) coexist credibly, and the narrator’s choices (seeking the mossy data center, offering only partial truth on the phone) feel motivated. The relationship with the mother, though mostly off-page, is sharply etched through specific moments like the pendant handoff. A small ding comes from occasional therapy-adjacent abstractions (“architecture of our family,” “protected vulnerability”) that slightly flatten otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interiority is rich and specific: her fear, creative drought, and relationship to abandoned characters all feel lived-in rather than gestured at. The moment where she reframes the characters as “offerings” earns her final readiness to write and reads as the culmination of a believable internal arc. Emotional states are mostly embodied via environment and images (the shell, the mossed stone) rather than labels, and her contradictions (drawn here despite “better judgment”) are clear. A touch more idiosyncratic, less generalized phrasing around “the only work that mattered” would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and long-term commitment are clear and credible, and her emotions at the end feel earned. However, she faces almost no friction or internal contradiction on the page, so we don’t see her under real pressure. The interiority is specific enough to avoid stock feeling, but remains largely one-note—reverent, patient, fulfilled. This limits the depth of character change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and moving—the grandmother’s death and the desire to “translate heartbeats into maps” roots her actions convincingly. Interiority is textured and embodied (knees aching in the cold, breath slowing), but there’s little genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her patience and purpose feel almost too serene; we don’t see real doubt, fear, or a live alternative path being foreclosed. The endurance here reads more like continuation of a settled identity than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira is sharply etched as a contemplative, pattern-seeing craftsperson, and her professional worldview cleanly shapes how she approaches the timer and the cavern. Her motivation—to understand and repurpose the mechanism rather than simply repair it—is clear and consistent. What’s missing at this level is sustained internal contradiction or a felt emotional cost; she glides toward insight with very little resistance or self-conflict. The final “satisfaction of a proper question” is earned but not especially costly, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The weaver’s motivation and bargain with the grotto are clear and specific, and her emotional relationship to sorrow feels embodied rather than abstract (“threatening to calcify her from the inside”). However, in the present moment there is little contradictory impulse—she “did not resist” the calcification—so internal conflict reads as largely settled rather than dynamically pressured. The final acceptance of becoming pattern feels thematically apt but not newly earned within this scene; it confirms an existing stance instead of pushing her through a fresh, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The widow’s interiority is rich, specific, and continuously enacted through concrete micro-choices (ignoring the kettle, touching the mane, resuming work). Her relationship to grief—simultaneously holding on and letting go—is dramatized rather than summarized, and the final endurance choice (continuing to carve) feels fully earned. The contradiction between “containment” and “freedom” runs through her worldview without neat resolution. There are no unearned epiphanies; her insights clearly grow from the long practice hinted at in the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is specific, coherent, and carried through: she’s not seeking redemption but a negotiation with the ghost of her former self, and all of her tactics (scavenging confessions, using the camera wheel) align with that. Interiority is rich and particular, especially her redefinition of ambition from “edge of something vast” to “single, granular goal.” The internal contradiction—resolute scavenger using other people’s failures to avoid a direct confrontation with her own—is present and credible. The final acceptance of exhaustion as peace feels earned by the preceding emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation, competence, and temperament are clear and specific (her delight in mapping “beyond saving” structures; the equations clicking into plans), and her choices drive the story. What’s missing at this level is felt internal contradiction or real emotional cost—she never seriously doubts herself, faces resistance, or reveals a shadow side. The line “She was functionally creative, always had been” leans toward label rather than dramatized contradiction. The ending stance feels more like confirmation than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation (avoiding finishing the clock as a way of postponing grief) is specific and sustained, and the final decision to wind it feels earned by the prior interiority. We get a clear, individual sensibility—his relationship to clocks, his grandfather, and silence. Internal contradiction is present (love for the craft vs. rejection of its “importance”), though the struggle at the climax resolves a bit smoothly, with little real-time resistance. Still, his micro-choices and perceptions under pressure read convincingly human.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s vocation, worldview, and motive (“errant legend seeker,” focused on the “architecture of lies”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—renting a barge, choosing this hour, steering toward older brick—align with them. Interiority is textured and specific rather than generic. However, she experiences little overt internal conflict or contradiction under pressure; her motivation is steady rather than tested. The ending shows commitment more than a costly change, which keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and vivid—“philosophical seed collector” with weathered hands and a clear inheritance-driven motive. His interiority feels earned and character-particular, especially in how he reads patterns in knots and seeds. However, internal conflict is muted: he moves fairly smoothly from curiosity to understanding without much felt contradiction or struggle. The final realization is credible but involves little visible cost or sharply dramatized renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The traveler’s vocation, worldview, and current predicament cohere into a very specific interior life; the image of her as a “ghost haunting a place she had never meant to stay” is especially strong. Her choice to stay at the end grows credibly from her history of mapping departures and her fascination with “explained absences.” Emotional experience, however, remains mostly at a conceptual/lyric level; there is little embodied, contradictory feeling under pressure, which keeps this just shy of top-tier. More small, concrete micro-choices or flashes of irrationality would deepen the sense of a living, struggling person rather than a beautifully articulated stance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prince’s inner life is vivid and specific: his mix of duty (“find the kill-switch”) and near-religious awe toward the organic remnants makes him feel particular rather than archetypal. His hypothesizing habit and the way he treats the egg (“like a broken heart made solid”) reveal both intellect and vulnerability under pressure. The final shift from obedient executor to someone choosing an alternate path is motivated and legible, though the cost of defying his father could be made more concrete. A slightly sharper, more dramatized internal contradiction at the end (hesitation, fear, or sacrifice on the page) would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and particular—her inherited restlessness, the coin, the sand, the grandmother’s mantle all build a coherent psychology. Her core motivation (turning a destructive legacy into protection) is clear and consistent. However, internal conflict is largely summarized rather than put under fresh, on-page pressure; there is no concrete present-tense choice that truly costs her. The ending reads as a reaffirmation of an existing stance more than a hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is vivid and coherent: the fusion of literal luminosity and skepticism gives her a distinct psychology, and her shift from cataloguing possibilities to committing to liberation feels earned. Her interiority is particular (“sidereal patience,” “realistically imaginative patience”) rather than generic, and her actions align with that mindset. The main limitation is cost: her choice to free the memories reads as emotionally meaningful but not sharply pressured or risky, so her arc lands as thoughtful rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Vael’s sensibility—ritualistic, nostalgic, burdened by inherited duty—is clearly and consistently rendered, especially in the way they handle the petal and the gear. However, their inner life leans more toward lyrical reflection than conflicted decision-making; contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. The choice to bring the gear “this time” hints at a deeper ambivalence that isn’t fully dramatized. As a result, the final stance feels more observed than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara is sharply drawn through her vocation, rituals, and grief-driven quest; her choice to go to the greenhouse, engage with the ribbon, and reframe her work is well motivated. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (the “spectral mentorship,” the way she reads environment through stone and ritual). The final shift—from doubting the ghost to accepting the inherited role and cost—is earned by prior images and memories. The main limitation is that internal conflict (resistance vs acceptance of this vocation) could be made a shade more contradictory on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s guilt, ritualized penance, and meticulousness are sharply etched, and his micro-choices (adjusting the pendulum, choosing to fully feel the 37 seconds) align cleanly with his motivation. The backstory of his negligence and his daughter’s death integrates smoothly into his present-tense stance. The internal conflict between wanting absolution and accepting permanent guilt reads convincingly as Earned Stasis. A touch more contradictory impulse in the live moment (e.g., a flicker of refusal or rebellion) could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The gardener’s gentle, attentive nature is clear and consistent, and his history with the cemetery gives him credible motivation to engage with the tapestry. However, he faces almost no internal conflict or contradiction; he moves from curiosity to understanding without resistance. The “called to do this” feeling is effective but simplified, with little sense of emotional cost. As a character sketch in a quiet fable, he works, but he does not quite reach the layered complexity elite venues often want.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, worldview, and ethical stance are crisply drawn and consistent, and her interiority feels particular rather than generic. Her mix of humility and audacity comes through in concrete images (the kingfisher, the lake, the quill). However, she faces little real internal contradiction or destabilizing pressure; her hesitation doesn’t quite rise to a conflicted choice with visible cost. The final move—she begins to write—feels earned but emotionally mild.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motives are clear, specific, and consistent—preserving stories, broadcasting them covertly, and now coaxing them from dust. Her professional role as a copyist and her secret work as a pirate broadcaster cohere into a believable, competent personality. However, she faces little on-page moral or emotional dilemma; there are no truly contradictory impulses or hard trade-offs dramatized in the moment. The result is a rich sketch of a character without a fully stressed interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s grief, reverence, and ambivalence toward her grandmother are rendered with concrete ritual (burning, sifting, assembling) rather than labels, and her core choice—to honor via destruction and reconstitution—feels psychologically earned. The “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” self-concept gives her a distinct, specific interior logic. Internal contradiction (longing for truth vs. acceptance of incompleteness) is present but could be dramatized with one sharper moment of resistance or doubt. Relationships are necessarily one-sided here, but the grandmother’s elusiveness is well embodied in Mira’s partial understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to uncover and preserve an unflattering truth—is clear, consistent, and strongly rooted in their disposition as a rationalist outsider. Interiority is specific and character-particular, especially in how artifacts trigger chains of thought (“holding it I feel the weight of someone else's obsessions”). There is credible ambivalence about the price of this work (“I agonize over this evidence because it demands a price”), though contradictory impulses are more stated than dramatized in action. The ending’s endurance/renunciation (choosing the slow, lonely work) is earned but emotionally understated, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor is sharply etched: exile, silenced singer, now a teacher whose ethic (“braid,” subtracting noise) grows credibly from trauma. Her motivations and contradictions (past hatred vs present patience, belief in harmony vs knowledge of voices as dangerous) are clear and consistent. The refugee student is sketched with efficient specificity, though he remains more emblem than full character. The change at the end is primarily conceptual and retrospective rather than dramatized under acute pressure, which limits the emotional bite.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s gift, history with the university, and bond to her grandmother create a coherent, particular psyche whose choices (following the call, ingesting the seed, deciding to build a kitchen) feel motivated. Her interiority is sensorial and specific (knowledge as flavor, pruning as remembered language), and the refusal to be commodified is consistent. However, she is rendered almost entirely as a virtuous vessel for wisdom, with little on-page contradiction or real temptation by institutional power, which slightly flattens complexity at this length. The change at the end feels earned but relatively low-cost and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is well-defined through her meticulous honesty and quiet sense of duty, and Mira’s presence usefully refracts Elara’s self-image. The involuntary truthfulness and her reputation among pilgrims give her a specific social position. However, Elara’s internal conflict is underplayed—she moves from doubt to acceptance of a grand purpose very quickly, with little struggle. The final realization feels slightly too tidy emotionally for the scale of what’s being claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and coherent—her “creeping normality noticer” sensibility and inherited attentiveness to displaced objects feel distinctive and drive how she moves through the house. Motivation (to understand why some houses feel alive) is clearly stated and her micro-choices (cataloguing shifts, reverently handling the cup, keeping the shard) align with it. Internal contradiction is muted; she meets the realization with calm recognition rather than any friction or cost, which limits depth. The final inheritance insight feels earned but emotionally gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thalassor’s inner life is specific and consistent, from accumulated souls to the foxglove revelation reconfiguring his self-concept. His shift from “guardian” to “witness” is clearly motivated and paid for by recognizing that his past “kindness without nuance was merely cruelty.” The emotional arc is primarily conceptual rather than bodily felt, but the contradictions in his identity are well dramatized. The diver is thinly sketched, but that’s appropriate for this focal length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s drive to understand rather than merely escape is clear, consistent, and nicely particularized through her use of the dice and proofs. The “grim optimism” and patience in captivity feel credible, and her final reframing of the staircase is earned by the prior intellectual work. However, the internal conflict between wanting escape and wanting understanding remains mostly conceptual; we rarely see contradictory impulses clashing in-scene. Emotion skews cerebral, with limited embodied texture beyond trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—insomnia as “companion,” the ache to create, her methodical decoding of symbols—and her final shift from lonely doubt to active, hopeful connection (leaving the paintings, finally sleeping) feels earned. The emotional life is mostly internal but embodied via sensory attention to brush, paper, and greenhouse. However, contradictory impulses under pressure (hope vs skepticism, need for connection vs fear of exposure) are more told than dramatized, so the epiphany reads a bit smooth. The cost of her change—vulnerability in leaving messages for strangers and surrendering to rest—registers, but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren is vivid, specific, and coherently motivated—her guide training, the lens, and the bread ritual all align with a deep need to preserve culture. Her emotional life is embodied through concrete routines rather than labels, and the final choice to step toward the thaw with the beekeeper’s loaf feels earned. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (safety vs revelation) is more implied than actively contested on the page, so contradiction under peak pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iris’s motivation—to escape a foretold death and step beyond fate—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her professional identity as a counter-clockwise clockmaker nicely fuses with her obsession with reversing time. However, the interior conflict feels muted; she rarely wavers, so contradictory impulses under pressure (“liberation vs. annihilation”) are stated more than dramatized. A touch more embodied doubt or irrational fear at the activation moment would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s motivation—caught between a suicidal surrender to quiet and the inherited obligation to finish her grandmother’s work—is clear and consistent, with the photograph curse and the grandmother’s death anchoring it. Her confession at the mirror (“she had let herself sink… had welcomed the water’s embrace”) earns the shift at the end and forecloses the option of retreat. Internal contradiction (wanting oblivion vs. choosing to walk into terror) is present but often rendered in abstract, conceptual language rather than fully embodied emotion. The absence of any other on-page character does limit relational pressure, but for a single-POV interior piece, the arc lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prophet’s vocation and outlook are clear and consistent, and her actions (timing strikes, reading clouds) align with that role. However, she faces little genuine pressure; there’s no sharp internal contradiction or difficult trade-off, just a confident practitioner performing her craft. The “gift and burden” line gestures toward cost but no specific emotional or practical burden is dramatized. The piece reads more as a character vignette than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—finding the truth about the lost expedition and the watchers—is clear, consistent, and rooted in her long practice of patient observation. Her quiet defiance of the Council (keeping the whistle, following the marked sequence, blowing the signal) aligns well with her established temperament. However, her interiority skews more descriptive than conflicted; we don’t see much active internal contradiction or cost beyond inferred obsession and isolation. The final choice is earned but doesn’t yet register as a sharp personal rupture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—whether to expose Major Caldwell and by extension her grandfather’s complicity—is clear, coherent, and rooted in her identity as both historian and granddaughter. Her emotionally rational disposition is well-articulated, though often told rather than embodied in specific, pressured behaviors. The internal conflict between loyalty to family and loyalty to truth is present but mostly summarized instead of dramatized through small, concrete choices in the moment. The final decision to publish feels earned, but the path there is intellectualized rather than fully lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s vocation, sensibility, and obsession with “artifacts of retreat” are sharply drawn, and her micro-choices (wading out despite isolation, pocketing the inkwell, hiding her notes) align with that core. The internal drive to reframe her work from bureaucratic surveying to “archeologist of abandoned dreams” feels motivated and culminates cleanly at the end. However, her internal conflict remains relatively low-friction—there’s little on-page pushback or risk beyond mild environmental danger and colleagues’ off-page dismissal. A bit more contradiction or cost in her stance under pressure would deepen her characterization for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s vocation-grounded motivation (“trace honest origins”) is clear and her temperament—patient, meticulous, drawn to marginalia—feels particular. The slow, sedimentary realization that she is inheriting a clandestine role is well earned, and the final commitment to continue the hidden archive reads credible. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost on the page; her choice feels right but not difficult. The piece leans into contemplative steadiness rather than dramatizing a pulled-in-two conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied; her grief is rendered through concrete craft choices (refusing the basilica, making private dream-lanterns) rather than abstract labels. The contradictory impulses—needing to preserve her daughter and being hurt by every act of preservation—are present in scene, especially in watching the childhood dream and immediately starting another crane. Her enduring choice to keep building containers for loss reads as an Earned Stasis with clear cost. A minor limitation is that no other character appears on-page to pressure her, so the relational crucible remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The interiority is vivid, specific, and character-particular: survivor’s guilt, humiliation at the banality of how he lived, and obsessive intellectualization all feel rooted in one psyche. His “hunt” through perturbation theory grows credibly from those traits, and the conflict between overthinking and the impossibility of answers is active rather than stated. The final endurance stance—accepting a search that “will never end but must continue anyway”—reads as an Earned Stasis with real cost. The only limiter is that all relationship dynamics (especially with the dead wife) stay recollected rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is vivid, with concrete motives (mission vs. unnamed hunger for “a frequency of belonging”) and a clear perceptual style, and her curiosity-driven choice to activate the machine tracks with what we’ve seen. The epiphany that she was “the missing piece all along” is thematically apt and mostly earned. However, internal conflict is relatively soft—her risk calculus and fear are underplayed, so the final acceptance comes a bit too smoothly. A hint more contradiction or visible cost in her choice to trigger and then accept the machine’s revelation would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s interiority is rich and specific—her profession, guilt, and family history interlock into a coherent psychology, and the final acceptance of memory feels earned from what we know of her. The bodily/emotional register (“ache in her chest,” “breath a conscious effort”) grounds the abstract guilt. However, the conflict remains largely one-note: she arrives already tormented and leaves still tormented but remembering, with limited on-page micro-choices under fresh pressure. The mother–father triangle is powerful but summarized rather than dramatized in scene, which slightly flattens the complexity of her motivations.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator’s interiority is specific and credible—his learned caution, inherited guilt, and decision to end the ritual all feel grounded in prior mistakes. The woman is sketched efficiently but with enough detail (the inherited brow, exhausted recognition) to avoid stereotype and create a real relational crucible. The final renunciation—dropping the pull—is well-earned by his earlier reflection and positions him as someone willing to pay a private emotional cost to shift the pattern. There’s a slight tendency to label (e.g., “uncommonly thoughtful”) rather than always dramatize traits, but it doesn’t undercut the core turns.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: pride, loss of competence, and isolation all feed into the choice to launch again. Her disability and history with navigation feel integrated rather than token, and the breakup with Maren plus social withdrawal give her current attempt emotional cost. The interiority is mostly concrete and character-particular, though a few lines (“That was the thing about regrets…”) drift toward generalized statement. The final stance—choosing movement despite persistent damage—feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s interiority is rich and specific—the “house with all the furniture removed” metaphor and the sense of leaden, unremembered guilt feel particular and embodied rather than generic. Her motivation (to rebuild some kind of ethical/emotional self post-wipe) is clear and consistent, and the ending realization about empathy growing from present wonder rather than past guilt is earned. However, the internal conflict is more described than dramatized under acute pressure; we don’t see her make a hard choice that costs her anything in the moment. The time traveler remains a cipher, functioning more as an idea than a character exerting on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysara’s grief, fear, and readiness are clearly motivated and anchored in concrete memories of Korin and her lineage. The internal conflict—fear of losing humanity versus desire to reach her brother—is present but resolves smoothly without much mess or contradiction under peak pressure. Her metamorphosis feels earned but emotionally cushioned; we rarely see her act against her own best story about herself. Still, the interiority is specific enough to feel like a person rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cartomancer’s guilt, longing, and self-justifying attraction to magic are well-rooted in specific history (“that terrible morning when she had chosen magic over motherhood”), and her motivation feels coherent throughout. Her internal conflict—wanting to reclaim lost time while suspecting that’s impossible—plays credibly in the scene. The final acceptance/forgiveness emerges from physical, costly action (cutting her palm) and prior setup rather than from nowhere, though it edges toward being too neat emotionally for the depth of harm implied. Still, her interiority is distinct and embodied enough to feel like a real, flawed person rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Seraph’s pacifism, grief, and caretaker role are clear and distinctive, and her patience and refusal of violence feel deeply baked-in rather than decorative. The inheritance of Kwan Yin’s tear and her long solitude credibly motivate the choice to “begin to stitch.” Internal contradiction is mostly implied (pacifism vs regret over lost crewmates, joy vs grief) rather than dramatized in live conflict, which slightly blunts the peak turn. The final step into the new dimension feels earned but emotionally low-friction, with minimal sense of cost beyond leaving the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s core motivation (seeking the “texture of transformation”) is clear and consistent, and her actions—giving away her estates, walking, uncorking the jars—align with it. Interiority is vivid and particular, but her emotional palette stays mostly in one register of receptive awe and quiet purpose. There’s little true internal contradiction or felt resistance to the costs she’s paid; her destitution reads as fully integrated rather than still-stinging. The final “change” is more an articulated realization than a difficult, dramatized shift in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly sketched—competent, curious, “calmly inventive”—and her shift from dutiful sentinel to covert revolutionary feels motivated by traits seeded from the opening. However, her interiority remains largely linear and unconflicted; there’s little sense of genuine moral hesitation or fear around betraying the regime. Emotion is mostly implied through controlled description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The result is a strong but not yet layered characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation (the grandmother’s promise and her need to understand the eels) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the precognition adds a distinct shading to how she sees the world. Interiority is specific—“like a second heartbeat” is character-inflected rather than generic. However, her internal conflict in the climactic moment is somewhat under-pressured; she moves from intent to revelation with little felt resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. The change at the end (from catching to joining patterns) is emotionally credible but could land harder with a sharper sense of what she’s giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with clear motivation rooted in censorship, fear, and a stubborn belief that “the act of naming was itself a form of resistance.” Her contradictory impulses—seeking safety in silence yet climbing into the storm to speak—are active in scene and culminate in an earned shift when she realizes she has been holding the pause herself. Emotional states are embodied through tactile details (cold railing, timer, rain on the dome) rather than labels. The only limitation is that the cost of her years of self-erasure remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in present-tense interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    Varn’s characterization is specific and coherent—his mechanical arm, past duel, and philosophy clearly drive his choices in the present confrontation. However, his interiority is largely stated in abstract terms rather than embodied through conflicted impulses under pressure. The younger scholar remains thin and emblematic (rigid certainty) rather than individuated. The final shift to “mutual recognition” reads as plausible but emotionally underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira and Delphine are sharply sketched with specific, non-generic histories (penny poet, pianist-turned-arsonist), and their motives for secrecy and connection are clear. The emotional turn—Mira choosing to expose her hidden poems to Delphine—is credibly prepared. However, internal contradiction and pressure are more implied than dramatized; Mira’s fear vs. desire to share rarely collides on the page in a moment of visible struggle. The relationship does change, but under relatively low on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, guilt about the unplayed piece, and fixation on the station/arbor are specific and coherent, and his interiority (“grief that had calcified around his heart”) feels embodied rather than generic. His motivation for staying at the station and for going up tonight is clear and grounded in his history with Clara. What’s slightly underdeveloped is real-time contradiction under pressure—he doesn’t waver or face an on-page dilemma once the opportunity arises, so his flaw (avoidance, obsession) isn’t actively tested. The ending reads as an earned endurance of his stance rather than a new turn, which fits but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s role, history, and motivation are clearly etched, and her blend of skepticism and wonder feels character-specific rather than generic. Her choice to undertake the journey and to accept the seed’s non-verifiable gift is motivated and coherent with what we know of her and her grandmother’s legacy. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (verification vs trust) is more asserted than dramatized moment-to-moment, with relatively little contradictory impulse on the page. This keeps the arc persuasive but a touch thinner than the premise could support at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marek’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in his vocation; his slow, deliberate nature feels lived-in rather than told. His motivation—to process Elias’s departure and the “color of unspoken apologies”—is clear and coherently expressed through his attention to subtle details. The internal shift toward forgiveness at the end is well earned by prior reflection and micro-choices (studying the lace, accepting the compass’s new meaning). The one slight limit is that his conflict resolves a bit cleanly for such deep regret, skimming the messier edges of ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira functions primarily as a thematic vessel; her interiority is heavily expository ("The scientific mind she had trained...") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. While the internal shift is legible, the transition from rigid scientist to humble observer feels swift and slightly didactic, lacking the friction of a deeply ingrained habit resisting change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and thematically consistent, linking her art to her survival. However, the shift from traumatized survivor to determined pursuer feels rapid and slightly unearned by on-page competence; the leap from finding a path to hunting dangerous smugglers lacks a bridge in capability.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is defined by a compelling trait (movement as language) and a clear goal, but she lacks internal conflict. Her journey is one of smooth competence; she experiences no contradictory impulses or genuine moments of doubt that force a difficult choice. The realization at the end feels therapeutic rather than earned through a crucible of competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Aldric is distinct, but his immediate acceptance of the supernatural ("Aldric understood then") bypasses necessary confusion or struggle, making his competence feel unearned. The "stubbornness" cited in backstory does not manifest as a constraint or tool in the active scene, leaving his internal landscape somewhat static under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is depicted as a saintly, flawless figure ("gentle persistence," "never demanding"), lacking internal contradiction or grittiness. Her leadership is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices; she acts as a vehicle for the theme rather than a living consciousness under pressure. The mentorship plan revealed at the end feels like a bureaucratic solution rather than an emotional evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mei functions as a capable vessel for the concept rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal conflict, contradiction, or genuine obstacle. Her success is immediate and inevitable, lacking the difficult micro-choices or visible personal cost required to drive a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and shifts compellingly from observation to active participation. The connection between her professional expertise (maze design) and the personal stake (grandmother’s portrait) is well-drawn, though the emotion is slightly more stated than embodied in the early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira is consistent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal friction or active struggle on the page. She executes a pre-planned sequence perfectly, limiting character revelation through pressure; the choice to wear chains in a secret, empty vault feels like a symbolic affectation rather than a grounded tactical disguise.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich, and her synesthesia is woven seamlessly into her worldview rather than acting as a mere quirk. However, the central breakthrough arrives as a "quiet settling" rather than a hard-won consequence of an agonizing choice or active struggle, softening the sense of agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mira functions effectively as an observer-protagonist but lacks deep internal conflict or significant development; she performs her role without genuine risk or struggle. Her motivation is articulated through abstract philosophy rather than embodied drive, leaving her emotional arc feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by abstract labels ("thoughtfully spirited," "contemplative") and summary rather than dramatized choice. The "internal glaciers" and emotional stakes are asserted in reflection but not tested by on-page pressure or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s stunt background and phobia are established, but the "adaptive nature" is asserted rather than dramatized through distinct choices. Daniel functions as a stock villain with "honeyed condescension," pausing his threat so the protagonist can complete her arc. The resolution relies on a sudden internal pivot rather than a credible behavioral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as a static archetype rather than a living character; she faces no internal contradictions or difficult micro-choices. Her "mild obsession" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through behavior, and her emotional state is summarized ("she felt the weight") rather than embodied in reaction to the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is rich and consistent, effectively portraying the "reconstructed" nature of the robot's consciousness. However, the protagonist's primary change—an intellectual realization—feels somewhat abstract and lacks a visceral emotional cost or friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is consistent but functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character under pressure. Motives are stated ("believing that presence itself could mean something") rather than dramatized through struggle; the connection with Mira is immediate and frictionless, lacking the internal contradiction or reluctance that creates a "crucible" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is consistent and her internal worldview is well-rendered, but she functions more as an archetype of wisdom than a character under pressure. Her primary conflict is recalled in backstory rather than dramatized in the present, leaving her current "choice" (ignoring the villager) feeling like a confirmation of established traits rather than a struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is consistent and clear, but the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she moves from competence to mastery without obstacles. The trait "mechanically warm" acts as a label rather than an embodied reality, creating confusion about her nature (cyborg vs. human) without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elena's decision to remain in a flooded building for three days strains credibility, functioning as a plot device rather than a character choice. Her motivation relies on summarized realizations ("she understood," "she realized") rather than a dramatized struggle between safety and the desire for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s internal landscape is rich, blending physical fever remnants with the weight of grief effectively. The shift from paralysis to action is motivated by the interaction with the illustration, though the pivotal realization ("understood with sudden clarity") relies on an internalized summary rather than a dramatized interaction or subtextual epiphany, which slightly flattens the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation transitions from exploration to confession, but the initial "religiously skeptical" trait reads more as a declared label than a dramatized constraint before it dissolves. The internal shift is passive—he is overcome by the "drowsy alertness" rather than making a high-pressure active choice to engage.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype functioning as a camera; they observe and reflect but make no difficult choices under pressure. The character lacks interior conflict or agency, resulting in a static portrait rather than a narrative agent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer, but her characterization relies heavily on abstract self-definition ("preservation of wonder") rather than dramatized internal conflict or difficult choices. The "softly adaptive" trait is stated in exposition but not proven through a high-pressure pivot on the page; she succeeds without significant personal cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but his defining traits ("oddness," "sensitivity") are told via exposition rather than dramatized through friction or distinct behavioral quirks. He functions primarily as a vessel for the backstory and realization rather than an agent navigating immediate pressure. The internal landscape is coherent, but the lack of difficult on-page micro-choices keeps the characterization static.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence, and his transition from spy to mystic is conceptually strong, anchored by the final refusal. However, interiority occasionally relies on summary ("the irony was not lost on him") rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader slightly during the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist is compelling, blending theological, artistic, and technological elements into a distinct professional persona. Motivation is explicitly dramatized through his unique method, though the character functioning primarily in a preparatory mode limits the range of displayed emotion and active choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira is clearly defined by her condition, but her internal life feels more descriptive than active. The central choice—shifting from prediction to permission—is subtle and thematic, but lacks a visceral sense of struggle or resistance against the "exhaustion" mentioned. She acts as a willing vessel for the concept rather than a character driving events through difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("wanting that had grown into the gravity-defying curse," "labyrinth of self") rather than embodied emotion or choice. Mira acts as a vessel for the concept, lacking contradictory impulses or specific, grounded interiority; her "struggle" is resolved through abstract realization rather than a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren's motivation to defeat numbness is clear, but her progression relies heavily on Koren's guidance rather than her own active agency or risk-taking. The shift from passivity to wonder is smoothed over with internal summary ("She understood then") rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s internal landscape is well-drawn, with her meteorological expertise convincingly coloring her worldview. The shift from observer to actor is motivated, though the specific "intuition" of followers via atmospheric sense borders on a capability breach (supernatural) rather than expert observation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is somewhat passive, serving largely as a vessel for the theme; the central realization is delivered via internal summary rather than earned through high-stakes choices or active struggle against the grief. The specific "broker" occupation provides flavor but does not significantly shape her on-page tactics or decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Internal conflict is clear, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling (e.g., "ethically playful part of Mira's nature") rather than dramatized behavior. The emotional turning point feels more intellectualized than embodied, with the protagonist reasoning through the climax rather than feeling it viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina is a distinct focalizer with a clear objective, and her interiority aligns well with the atmospheric tone. However, the emotional arc is linear—moving from grief to action without significant internal contradiction or a moment of doubt that would test her resolve. The absence of competing impulses keeps the characterization functional rather than deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera is a consistent focalizer with a clear professional worldview, but her internal conflict is resolved too easily by a pre-existing philosophy. The character lacks a moment of genuine vulnerability or doubt that forces a difficult choice, rendering the stated emotional cost abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s background as a broker effectively informs her worldview, providing a distinct lens (freight weights, manifests) and a brief moment of internal friction against her grandmother's influence. However, the conflict is resolved instantly with low resistance, and the emotional arc feels linear and safe rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific backstory of burnout. However, the climax relies heavily on diagnostic interiority ("required her to be present, not performative") rather than embodied struggle or choice under pressure. The realization feels like an intellectual summary of the theme rather than a visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on role (illustrator) rather than internal depth; Sera functions as a lore-delivery vessel without contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. The "impossible promise" is mentioned but never dramatized as a pressure point, and her actions proceed without hesitation or moral trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, but the emotion is often filtered through diagnostic labels ("ambiguous loss," "mathematics of emotion") rather than embodied reaction. The decision to leave the eyes is a strong character beat that demonstrates a shift in values, earning the resolution despite the heavy introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maren is an archetype of "methodical kindness" lacking internal contradiction or flaws. Her actions are dictated by "essence" ("she cannot act otherwise"), which removes agency and dramatized struggle from the narrative. The emotional experience is summarized via labels rather than embodied in a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera’s resistance is organically rooted in her profession, and the medical diagnosis provides tangible pressure for the internal conflict. The shift from detachment to vulnerability is earned, though the final epiphany relies on somewhat abstract "label-speak" ("transformation required appetite") rather than purely embodied action, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s exhaustion is embodied well in the "shaking" and "seeing double," and her motivation to find peace drives the narrative arc. However, the "painter" identity leans on slight clichés ("colors she couldn't name") rather than specific technical action until the end. The choice to trade the brooch is motivated, though the emotional weight of the heirloom is explained rather than felt in the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Varen’s arc from arrogance to humility is clear and structurally sound. The pivot relies on summary ("The realization came not as a vision but as a sensation") and diagnostic labeling ("future was not a country... it was a garden") rather than dramatized action, which distances the emotional impact of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is consistent but lacks internal friction; his visions arrive automatically without toll, making him function more as a plot device than a person under pressure. The realization at the end feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.9)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated label "analytically artistic" rather than demonstrating these traits through contradictory choices under pressure. The protagonist's internal state is reported via summary ("trusted patterns more than instincts") rather than dramatized, and the emotional resolution comes through a magical tool rather than a difficult, character-defining decision.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer, but her internal conflict resolves too smoothly; her skepticism collapses into wonder without a struggle or significant behavioral cost. The pivotal emotional shift is driven by a sudden vision ("mother's face") rather than an active, difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a standard archetype ("bored immortal") defined by abstract labels ("ancient exhaustion") rather than specific, embodied habits. The central realization is received passively via the storm rather than earned through active struggle or a difficult, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena is a compelling figure with a clear internal landscape, but her pivotal choice relies heavily on the "magical" property of the ink pot rather than sheer character agency under pressure. The conflict between her father’s nature and her own is resolved somewhat intellectually rather than through a dramatized emotional struggle. The "con artist" backstory serves as flavor but doesn't actively tempt her toward deception in the scene, lowering the immediate stakes of her moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a static vessel for the premise rather than a dynamic protagonist; her "earnest studious pursuit" is stated as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. There is no internal contradiction or cost to her isolation, leaving her characterization flat and purely functional. The emotional landscape is described through abstract philosophy rather than embodied reaction to the "change" in the hum.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as an observer, receiving the central realization via a secondary character's monologue rather than through active struggle or high-stakes choice. The dockworker exists solely to dispense necessary backstory, lacking an independent agenda or interpersonal friction to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena's transition from hardened skeptic to believer relies on summarized internal labels ("regret," "longing") rather than dramatized action. The trait "gloomy cheerfulness" is explicitly stated but not fully embodied in her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions more as a vehicle for the prompt's themes than a conflicted protagonist; her "dual allegiance" is stated in exposition ("caught between") but she chooses sides immediately without hesitation or on-page cost. The lack of contradictory impulses in the moment reduces the character arc to a linear execution of a plan.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is competent, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and reflection rather than active struggle. The backstory about Yusuf feels inserted to explain motivation rather than driving immediate pressure. The trait "purposefully curious" is told as a label rather than demonstrated through a high-stakes deviation from protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is idealized, possessing competence without struggle; his blindness functions as a convenient superpower rather than a constraint forcing difficult trade-offs. The narrative lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices with visible cost, resulting in a flat emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Miriam’s professional competence and obsession are rendered with excellent specific interiority. The choice to trust her interpretation over the "atlas community" provides a solid backbone, though the immediate emotional cost of the discovery is more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eliorn is a capable and consistent protagonist whose esoteric expertise is well-rendered. However, her internal landscape is relatively static; she faces physical endurance rather than a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. The trait "cryptic" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through interaction, limiting its impact on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina's motivation is established through exposition rather than active struggle; her decisive choice to override survival instincts occurs off-page before the story begins. While the surrender at the end is thematic, her on-page agency is largely passive, acting as a functional key-turner for the temple's mechanism rather than a character wrestling with a live dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus is a clearly motivated protagonist with deep interiority, and the burden of his father's legacy is felt in the "stone in his chest." His choice to "inherit story" rather than silence is a strong, active decision that drives the narrative. However, the emotional articulation occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("membrane between what was and what might have been") rather than remaining grounded in embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the narrative; Elara's burden of "loving venom" creates a complex internal state that pays off in the transfer. The gardener serves as a functional vessel for the resolution, reacting with embodied emotion ("tears she could not explain") that validates the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is frictionless and her primary trait ("haunting optimism") is told via exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Maren functions more as a thematic vessel than a character under pressure, with no evident cost to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's agency is undercut by the "birthmark matches symbols" coincidence, which resolves the central mystery through genetics rather than effort or decoding. She lacks internal conflict or genuine reaction to the established dangers (ignoring the collapse that scared away professionals).

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren is a distinct focalizer with a clear obsession, but her primary trait ("carefully inventive") is asserted via label rather than demonstrated through high-pressure struggle. The internal landscape is rich, yet the emotional cost of her work remains somewhat abstract and told rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions as a static observer rather than an active agent, relying on the "underestimated genius" trope without an on-page test of her disguise. Her internal monologue asserts wisdom and danger, but she faces no immediate contradictory impulses or difficult choices in this scene. The emotions are described ("allowed herself a small smile") rather than embodied in a way that suggests genuine cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren's motivation is clear, but the internal conflict resolves too easily through external magical validation ("I forgive you" on the window). The emotional turning point relies on diagnostic labeling ("liminal space," "calcified") rather than dramatized friction, making the healing feel intellectually summarized rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira is a capable focalizer, and her internal landscape is successfully filtered through the "softened" anesthetic state. However, the key trait "shrewdly innocent" is established via summary exposition rather than dramatized through a pressured choice, and the emotional connection with the child relies on shorthand ("touch said everything") rather than unique, earned interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's internal state is articulated through summary ("hollow efficiency") rather than dramatized behavior or resistance. While the emotional shift is clear, the inciting burnout feels somewhat generic, and the character functions more as a vessel for the atmospheric event than a complex agent making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character motivation is well-drawn, moving effectively from professional precision to artistic communion. The interior shift is legible, though the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract and philosophical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic labels ("charming rogue scholar," "particular warmth") rather than dramatized complexity. While her motivation is clear, her competence feels unthreatened; the "rogue" persona is asserted via summary rather than proven through a difficult, high-cost choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The character is an archetype defined by abstract labels ("longing," "grief") rather than specific, embodied choices in a dramatized moment. No internal contradiction is played out in scene; she remains a static vessel for the theme. The trait "shyly unstoppable" is asserted rather than proven through a difficult decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The caretaker is a clearly defined archetype with distinct interiority, particularly the "foxglove regret." However, she remains static, functioning more as a vessel for the setting than a protagonist with agency; she faces no resistance and makes no difficult choices that reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her emotional arc lacks internal friction; she proceeds from hesitation to success without a genuine moment of doubt or conflicting impulse. The reconciliation feels inevitable rather than earned through character struggle, with reactions that lean toward idealized sentimentality rather than messy human reality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic abstraction ("conflicting values," "harmony") rather than embodied experience. The central epiphany—divining complex paternal intent from glue chemicals—reads as an authorial insertion rather than a credible character insight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor's interiority is rich and consistent, effectively grounding the narrative in her grief. However, her agency is largely strictly procedural; she performs a task over weeks rather than making difficult, high-stakes choices under pressure in a dramatized scene. The "accident" functions as vague backstory rather than a present pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara serves as a passive observer of the setting rather than an active agent; her "determination" is asserted by the narrator but not tested by significant resistance. The reunion is granted by the terrace’s drift rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marek functions primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; his motivation is abstract ("rhythm of belonging") and lacks immediate, embodied desperation. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page; he moves unhindered from entry to epiphany. The realization feels intellectual and handed to him by the note rather than earned through a difficult, defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren functions as a competent archetype rather than a specific individual; her "cheerful gloom" is told rather than demonstrated in behavior. The fisher's grief relies on stock phrasing ("void too large to name," "words dropped like stones") rather than unique, embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marek is a consistent, intelligible figure, but he functions more as a static vessel for the theme than a character under pressure. His "analyst's smile" and "nervous manipulations" suggest depth, but the story offers no internal conflict or difficult choice to test him. He begins and ends in the same state of confident control, lacking the vulnerability or contradictions required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype executing a ritual than a character under pressure. While her motivation is clear, she lacks internal contradiction or active struggle in the scene; the process goes exactly to plan without testing her competence or forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static archetype of wisdom rather than a dramatic character, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She faces no difficult choices and undergoes no change or costly endurance; her "flaws" are presented as misunderstood virtues.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character motivation relies heavily on diagnostic self-awareness ("innocence about the world's indifference") rather than embodied struggle. The interiority feels intellectualized and static, presenting a thesis on trauma rather than a lived experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as a thematic placeholder rather than a character with embodied desire or contradiction. Her internal state is described through abstract labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") and summaries of intent rather than dramatized impulses or difficult micro-choices. The lack of interaction or specific, high-stakes decisions results in a static portrayal where her "patience" reads as a lack of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    Motivation is established but static; Mira observes rather than deciding between conflicting values. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or a high-stakes micro-choice that would define character beyond her professional function.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.8)
    Aria functions as an archetype of competence rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions, doubts, or meaningful micro-choices. Her motivation is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and she undergoes no alteration or costly endurance by the end. The "borrowed heartbeat" suggests a constraint that is never operationalized as a price for her magic.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren creates a distinct focal point, but the secondary characters yield too easily to her monologue; Sera’s shift from vengeance to "softening" feels narrated rather than earned by pressure in the moment. The emotional turn relies on shared backstory (the list of names) rather than an active, conflicting choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") rather than behavior in the moment to convey complexity. The internal state is summarized via clichés ("steel in her spine," "calculus in her eyes") instead of emerging through a difficult, on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is an idealized archetype of resistance rather than a complex character; her "chaste" nature and defiance are static traits that face no genuine temptation or contradictory impulse. The lack of internal friction makes her a vessel for the theme rather than a living psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("urbane calligrapher," "uncommonly serene") rather than dramatized complexity. His emotional state is summarized as "serene," which dampens potential tension, and his pivotal realization feels like an intellectual calculation rather than a visceral reaction to pressure. The "calligrapher" trait appears only as a metaphor for precision and does not inform his physical actions in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motivation to honor forgotten histories is clear and drives the narrative, but her interiority relies heavily on the repeated label "esoteric realist's mind" rather than distinct, embodied thought. This diagnostic labeling appears during the peak climax beat ("shifting from preservation to improvisation"), distancing the reader from the immediate struggle. The character feels competent but slightly static, functioning more as an archetype than a flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    Yara is a coherent focalizer, but her internal arc relies heavily on summary ("It had taken Yara five winters to understand this") rather than dramatized struggle in the scene. The crucial emotional shift from guilt to acceptance is told as backstory, lowering the immediate stakes of her on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a procedural vessel for the ritual rather than a fully realized character. While her interiority regarding the "emotional cartography" is well-rendered, she faces no internal conflict or hesitation that would define her agency. The "transcendence" at the end is an asserted state change rather than an earned evolution of character.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maruk's specific trait of frugality anchors his character well, giving physical weight to his scholarly dedication. However, he functions more as a competent archetype than a conflicted protagonist; his internal journey is linear, lacking contradictory impulses or a moment of costly hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira's identity as a "scheming pacifist" is stated rather than dramatized through complex maneuvering; her "scheme" amounts to a thematic speech, and Kael's sudden capitulation feels convenient rather than earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira acts as a functional vessel for the concept rather than a living character; she lacks internal contradiction or specific desire beyond the immediate task. Her competence is absolute, removing the possibility of failure or the need for a defining choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's "feisty" nature is stated as a label rather than dramatized through interaction or resistance in the scene. The pivotal realization about wisdom arrives via summary ("Hours passed") and is explicitly described as "unearned," weakening the sense of internal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s philosophical conceit rather than a fully realized agent. While her "bewilderment" is stated, her internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses or active struggle required for higher bands; the climax involves her passively waiting for an inquiry to "rise in her throat" rather than making a difficult, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a competent focalizer whose shift from standard research to "thinking in absences" drives the narrative logic, fitting the scholarly mode well. However, she functions primarily as a vehicle for the concept; her internal struggle is abstract ("reverence," "courage"), lacking a visceral emotional cost or a moment where her personal desire conflicts with the necessary solution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "chimera twin" concept is evocative, particularly the "palimpsest" of shared memory, but it relies heavily on expository summary rather than dramatized interaction between the consciousnesses in the scene. The internal conflict is stated ("blissful aberration") rather than shown through a difficult choice until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena acts as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a conflicted character; she faces no difficult choices, contradictory impulses, or genuine risk. The trait "warmly methodical" is applied as a repetitive label (paragraphs 1 and 5) rather than dramatized through a costly decision under pressure. Her competence is absolute, removing the possibility of struggle or error.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is defined by competence and physical markers ("ripple-mark skin") rather than internal contradiction or messy humanity. Her motivation is clear, but she faces no distinct character-based choice or trade-off; the narrative relies on her established skills solving a problem linearly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation is duty-bound and linear without competing internal impulses. The "retrocognitive blessing" removes the need for active deduction or struggle, resulting in a character who observes and accepts rather than one who makes difficult trade-offs under pressure. The lack of distinct micro-choices flattens the character arc into a smooth, inevitable progression.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and consistent with the established trait of "preemptive nostalgia," creating a cohesive worldview. However, the character lacks active internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene; she observes and records without significant struggle or high-stakes choices. The "realization" comes smoothly rather than through pressure-tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a distinct protagonist grounded in specific trade details ("kerosene rag knot," "sacred measurements"), which gives her authority. However, her internal journey is relatively smooth; the realization at the mosaic feels immediate and lacks the friction of genuine doubt or conflicting impulses. The motivation is clear, but the lack of significant internal cost or hesitation keeps the character arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a thematic device, defined by stated labels ("warmly observant") rather than distinct, high-pressure choices. The sister remains a cipher, serving only as a prop for Mira's internal monologue rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira's interiority is consistent but relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("geometry of concrete walls") rather than embodied emotion. The realization regarding fear feels intellectually stated rather than psychologically earned through the pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maren is a highly competent protagonist, but she lacks internal friction or genuine struggle. Her actions are professional and effective, leading to a resolution without significant personal risk or cost. The character feels more like a function of the setting than a conflicted individual driving a narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elara acts as a competent archetype rather than a flawed individual; her journey lacks internal contradiction or hesitation. The "cost" of ascension (surrendering certainty) is stated intellectually but not felt through emotional struggle or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist functions more as an allegorical vessel than a grounded character; her internal conflict is articulated through abstract labels ("tender shadow keeper") rather than specific, embodied traits. While the shift from seeking safety to choosing exposure is legible, the emotional logic relies on diagnostic summary ("she had learned that love could suffocate") rather than dramatic enactment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya's skepticism is established well, but the transition from deep trauma to "ready to make promises again" feels unearned and rushed. The "virtuously mischievous" trait reads as a label inserted to force the plot rather than an organic driver of behavior. The emotional arc resolves too neatly, lacking the messy complexity of genuine recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation relies heavily on passive compulsion ("drawn... as though magnetised") rather than active agency. While the internal conflict regarding her heritage is established, the narrative is severed mid-sentence, preventing any assessment of the final choice, reaction, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's transition from "withdrawn" to healed is instantaneous and unearned by struggle or hard choice; the magic simply fixes him. Internal conflict is summarized ("suited his mood") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara serves as a passive observer rather than an active agent; her "personal loss" is stated as backstory but never generates on-page conflicting impulses or drives a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is a competent, consistent protagonist who fits the "quiet rebel" archetype well. However, she lacks internal friction or contradiction; her actions are efficient executions of a plan rather than difficult choices made under immediate pressure. The narrative relies on her competence without testing it against a flaw or a competing internal want.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions as a capable archetype (the weary guardian) rather than a specific individual; interiority relies on generic burdens ("weight of generations") rather than contradictory, personal drives. While the physical exhaustion is noted ("ragged hushes"), the internal landscape is static, lacking a distinct micro-choice or moment of doubt that would deepen the characterization beyond the role.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Seraphina functions more as a procedural archetype than a specific character; her "transformation" is asserted as a repetitive trait ("always emerged transformed always") rather than dramatized as a unique internal shift. The emotion "mossy delight" feels like an inserted label rather than embodied feeling. She lacks internal conflict or a moment of hesitation that would make her competence compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary ("uncertainly certain," "broken-clock tinkerer") rather than dramatized action. While the backstory establishes motivation, the narrative ends before the protagonist makes any high-stakes choice or faces a crucible that reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interiority is distinct, blending professional discipline with fresh grief in a way that motivates the shift from safety to risk. The choice to use the "old method" is a strongly embodied micro-choice that dramatizes her internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in specific backstory details (mother, brother), giving weight to her actions. Her competence is high, perhaps reducing the sense of immediate struggle, but her internal state ("exhaustion with fear") adds distinct character texture. The emotional cost is present but feels somewhat familiar/static rather than acutely paid in this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s internal state is vividly rendered, blending physical sensation with trauma response effectively. However, her reflection relies heavily on abstract labels ("shame," "complicity") rather than dramatized memory in spots, and the self-diagnosis of her "special" nature borders on explanatory rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is legible, but the acceptance of a life-altering burden arrives with perfect emotional calibration and no on-page resistance. The lack of contradictory impulses or hesitation in the face of such a destiny makes the character feel more like a vessel for the concept than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer with a distinct skill set that drives the narrative. However, his motivation lacks internal friction; he accepts the supernatural intrusion "without complaint" and "always did" engage, removing potential conflict or hesitation that would heighten the stakes. The "weightless burden" is stated rather than dramatized through struggle or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions primarily as a skilled operator of the plot rather than a character under pressure; her actions are competent but lack internal friction or contradictory impulses. While her history anchors her, she faces no difficult trade-offs, and her compliance with the frost's instructions feels procedural rather than driven by a desperate personal need or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's internal arc from revolutionary purity to curatorial complexity is compelling and deeply woven into the narrative. The tension between her past and present drives the scene, culminating in a choice that feels earned by her specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cassian is a distinct, functional protagonist, but he lacks the internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices required for higher bands. His adherence to the covenant is absolute, and while his history is established, he faces no moment of doubt or temptation that would transform his labor into a character-defining act of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rendered with precision, and her transition from collector to inhabitant of the silence is a distinct, character-specific arc. The choice to stay is a radical renunciation earned by her established yearning for thresholds, creating a resonant closure with high personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria functions as an observational vessel rather than an agent of choice; she lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses during the crisis. Her lack of panic and immediate, frictionless understanding of the slide remove the necessary struggle to earn the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mira is defined by labels ("quietly driven") and internal obsession rather than contradictory impulses or active choices under pressure. She functions primarily as a passive observer who receives an epiphany without navigating a dilemma or paying a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.7)
    Miriam functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she follows the diary's instructions without deviation, internal conflict, or tactical struggle. Her role is to witness a resolution achieved by others in the past, lacking a crucible moment where her specific choices alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but his emotional arc is static; the "uncomfortable work" is endured without a dramatized moment of hesitation or conflicting impulse in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Seraphine’s interiority is rich and distinct, grounding her role as a scribe in specific, felt details. Her connection to the past through the recording provides a clear, personal motivation that drives the scene's quiet action. The characterization effectively balances professional competence with a sense of inheritance and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara functions as a competent procedural vessel rather than a character with agency; she executes a pre-ordained ritual without doubt, struggle, or meaningful choice. Her internal state is defined by abstract labels ("paradox of her nature") rather than dramatized behavior, and her success requires no personal cost or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a competent professional whose internal reverence for the monastery provides texture, but her "choice" to pull the switch is essentially procedural compliance rather than a decision forged in a crucible. While the contrast between her love of silence and her duty to make noise creates a mild internal friction, the lack of a difficult trade-off or high-stakes hesitation limits character depth. The attribute "credibly curious" feels inserted rather than organic to her psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; their emotional state is static and serene throughout. Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "primal elegance") rather than dramatized traits revealed through pressure. There is no struggle or cost to their actions, resulting in a figure who functions more as a thematic vessel than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is a passive observer whose primary action is to follow instructions (digging where pointed). While her internal state is described, she lacks contradictory impulses or active agency under pressure; her "astonished" nature is told via label rather than dramatized through reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by her philosophical longing rather than embodied traits or conflicting impulses. While her motivation is clear, it remains abstract and intellectual; the "borrowed time" pressure is stated but does not force a difficult, visible choice on the page beyond the act of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific individual, functioning primarily as a vessel for the theme. Emotions are frequently labeled ("tenderness," "did not feel disappointment") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or behavior. The poet's "warmly attentive" nature is asserted but lacks the friction of a genuine internal struggle or character-specific flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maren is consistently characterized as a dedicated caretaker, but her emotional arc lacks friction; her acceptance of death feels pre-resolved and saintly rather than earned through struggle in the scene. The absence of contradictory impulses or a moment of genuine weakness makes her feel more like an archetype than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is largely summarized through abstract labels ("scientific mind a battlefield," "reluctant wonder") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment. While the arc of transformation is clear, the emotions are reported to the reader rather than embodied in specific physical or sensory reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a coherent archetype (a psychopomp turned gardener) with a clear backstory, but he functions as a static vehicle for the ritual. He lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses, executing the task without a moment of doubt or difficult micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's primary trait ("bloodhound nose") is metaphorically shoehorned into a tactile resolution ("fingertips"), muddling the specific skillset required to solve the puzzle. The epiphany ("I finally understood") arrives spontaneously without an on-page trigger or active struggle, rendering the character passive in their own breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("irony of her position," "blessed pariah") rather than embodied emotion or behavior. The protagonist's internal change is triggered by a passive vision rather than a character-driven choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful") rather than behavior enacted under pressure. The protagonist’s "haunted" motivation is stated in exposition, and his final reaction—simply leaving when confronted with a complication—feels emotionally disconnected from the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira is defined primarily by backstory summary ("crisis actor... real crisis survivor") and explicit authorial labels rather than active choices in the scene. Her present-tense actions are ceremonial (walking, placing a board) and lack immediate, dramatized cost or struggle against resistance. The motivation is stated clearly ("determined they would not be forgotten") but feels theoretical rather than visceral in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's mercury-glass physiology is distinct and visually integrated ("casting no shadow"), anchoring the character. However, the internal pivot from fear to acceptance is summarized ("On the eighth night, she finally understood") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interior voice is distinct, capturing the "chess mind" well. However, the epiphany relies entirely on an external prop (the tapestry) miraculously depicting her exact backstory rather than an internal realization earned through struggle. This "magic mirror" device bypasses the need for genuine character work to resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    Character motivation is clear, but the story relies heavily on diagnostic labeling (e.g., "Her attribute of being innocently mischievous had never been a choice") rather than dramatized traits. The protagonist's internal struggle is largely resolved before the scene begins ("price... paid in advance"), resulting in a lack of urgent, on-page micro-choices that carry visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The internal conflict—certainty vs. doubt—is well-rendered and embodied through the ritual action. However, the epiphany relies on diagnostic interiority ("she understood that uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic") rather than purely dramatized realization, slightly distancing the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's internal struggle is clear, and the choice to relinquish the shell provides a legible character arc. However, his epiphany relies heavily on the supernatural interaction with the pool rather than purely internal pressure or agency, making the emotional pivot feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine flaws; her mastery of the "nearly impossible" technique is instantaneous, aided by the jasmine which bypasses any struggle or cost. Mira functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a character making difficult choices with visible consequences. The narrative tells us she purifies her intentions but dramatizes only the immediate success.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions as a competent thematic vehicle rather than a contradictory character; her emotional fluctuations are stated in backstory but do not complicate the on-page choice. Her immediate understanding of the caller's needs removes the potential for internal struggle or misinterpretation, resulting in a static protagonist who faces no genuine test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's central trait ("involuntarily truthful") is established solely through exposition and backstory, never dramatized in an on-page interaction or choice. While her internal motivation is clear, the lack of interpersonal conflict renders her defining attribute theoretical rather than active in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aldric is a coherent focalizer with a consistent internal landscape, but the inciting retrieval of his mother's memory relies on convenient amnesia to service the twist. The emotional shift is driven more by the plot device (the note) than by a pressure-cooked character choice or realization.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s motivation is clear, but her internal struggle evaporates at the climax ("felt no fear"), reducing the protagonist to a passive vessel for the plot. The emotional cost of leaving her life is intellectualized rather than felt, making the final choice seem inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is legible, but the internal arc resolves via a convenient realization rather than a high-cost choice. A significant logic error occurs in the interiority: the narration claims she speaks "as if she still had subjects," contradicting the earlier statement that the kingdom "still knelt in her presence."

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for thematic assertions rather than a breathing character with conflicting desires; interiority consists of abstract philosophizing ("palette of resolve") rather than embodied emotion. There is no internal struggle or potential for failure, making Maren a mouthpiece for the prompt's concepts rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is clear, but the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("chronologist's disease," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied experience. The "jealousy" is stated in reflection rather than dramatized in the present moment, creating distance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's internal journey feels smoothed over by retrospective summary rather than dramatized through struggle. The transition from loss to "revelation changed nothing and everything" lacks an on-page cost or moment of resistance; she accepts the thematic epiphany too easily to earn the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (scholarship vs. intuition) is clear, but the resolution relies on assertion ("realized with sudden clarity") rather than a dramatized decision with felt cost. Motivation is explicitly stated ("not to heal, but to understand") rather than revealed through resistance or failure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is distinct and deeply felt; Eleanor’s internal conflict between her habit of metaphorical distance and the need for a raw apology drives the scene effectively. The relationship history is efficiently packed into the interaction, and Margot’s pushback (“You always spoke in riddles”) forces a genuine character turn. The "exorcist" role adds unique flavor, though it functions primarily as backstory rather than active mechanics in this specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she navigates the setting but makes no difficult choices under pressure. There is no dramatized interior conflict or agency that alters the story's trajectory, leaving her defined solely by her role.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aira is a consistent, grounded protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal journey lacks active struggle or contradictory impulses. The climax relies on diagnostic summary ("She understood then") rather than a dramatized realization born from pressure, keeping the character arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("intrusion detection specialist," "spatially gifted") to explain intuition rather than dramatizing agency through difficult choices. Mira's "gift" functions as a convenient superpower that removes ambiguity, while her emotional arc is summarized abstractly ("physics of letting go") rather than embodied in reaction to the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict between mathematical rigidity and the chaos of risk is compelling and well-drawn. However, the resolution relies on a sudden, somewhat diagnostic realization ("grief could calcify," "invitations") rather than a shift earned through immediate pressure or interaction. The father’s passivity in the final scene reduces the emotional cost of the exchange, making the reconciliation feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is rich and philosophical, grounding her specific resignation and role. However, the characterization remains largely static; her impulses are described in summary rather than dramatized through conflicting choices in a pressure-filled scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist is static, functioning as an observer of her own memories rather than an agent of change. Internal conflict is summarized ("haunted euphoria") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The character's transition from "desperately jocular" defensiveness to vulnerable admission ("I need someone to remember my name") provides a clear arc, but the pivot relies on summary ("understood immediately") rather than dramatized struggle. The internal conflict between efficiency and connection is told through exposition ("work was a kind of penance") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in the scene. The dialogue feels slightly constructed to deliver traits rather than organic conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist functions more as a sensor than an agent, reacting to the environment rather than making pressure-driven choices. Emotional states are summarized with high-level labels ("grief," "sorrow," "joy") rather than dramatized through distinct, embodied behavior or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira is a competent focalizer, but her interiority leans heavily on diagnostic labels ("confidently uncertain," "haunted her corridors") rather than embodied reaction to immediate pressure. The central conflict is resolved largely through summary and pre-existing competence, leaving her character arc feeling static and lacking a decisive, costly on-page transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s internal landscape of grief is rendered with sensitivity, and her motivation to bridge the silence is clear. However, the "whispering advisor" functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully realized character, and his sudden disappearance feels like a convenient device rather than an earned character exit.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies on label-speak ("analytically intuitive") and backstory summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Mira functions as an archetype without internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-rendered through the lens of the setting ("vomiting stars," "quiet rebellion"). However, the "rebellion" lacks immediate, on-page cost or risk; the significant physical toll is relegated to backstory, making the victory in the present moment feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is a highly competent protagonist with a distinct, embodied connection to her environment. However, she faces no genuine internal conflict or doubt; her victory is linear and inevitable, lacking the "felt cost" or difficult choice required for higher bands. The characterization leans toward idealized competence rather than human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's internal state is delivered almost exclusively through summary and abstract wisdom ("She understood," "She had learned") rather than active, contradictory thought in the moment. The emotional calibration is too perfect; she functions as an idealized archetype without the internal friction or embodied messiness required for higher bands. The backstory (fever/voice) feels like a convenient shorthand rather than a lived trauma shaping a difficult choice in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies entirely on summary and exposition of traits ("most dangerous kind of revolutionary," "cultivated patience") rather than dramatized choice in a specific scene. Eleanor is a collection of thematic labels; we never see her confront a specific obstacle or manifest these traits under immediate pressure. Motivation is stated abstractly rather than revealed through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("built walls," "tender into the terrible") rather than dramatized behavior to establish internal conflict. While the motivation is stated, Maren's transformation feels more like a reaction to the magical whale than a struggle with her own specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, blending theatricality with survivalist pragmatism. However, the direct self-diagnosis ("I am morally ambiguous. I know this about myself") relies on diagnostic label-speak rather than dramatizing that ambiguity in the present moment, which flattens the characterization slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; the "tremor of certainty" removes the potential for doubt or struggle. She faces no difficult choice or visible cost, functioning more as a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira reads as an idealized archetype (the wise, sensory-gifted mentor) rather than a flawed protagonist; she faces no internal resistance or genuine risk of failure. The trait "innocently cunning" appears as a label rather than a dramatized complexity, and her lack of struggle flattens the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophy than an agent under pressure; her internal conflict is intellectual rather than visceral. While her interiority is detailed, she faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices in scene, resulting in a static character arc defined by observation rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara is defined more by her thematic function and backstory than by active, embodied traits in the present moment. The interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("healing was not a destination but a practice") rather than visceral emotion, creating a distance that feels more therapeutic than dramatic. The "future self" resolution feels like a convenience rather than a character-driven choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren and Soren are distinct, with the interaction grounded in a clear client-practitioner dynamic. However, Maren's "steady curiosity" is stated as a trait rather than dramatized through a costly choice, and Soren's rapid transition from "hollow eyes" to relief feels slightly linear and tidy for the complex trauma implied.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's shift from scholar to participant provides a clear internal arc, but the motivation ("desperate necessity") remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through specific stakes or potential loss. The character functions more as a vessel for the concept than a living individual; the "end of my innocence" is a labeled milestone rather than a felt history. Interiority relies on summary ("I understood now") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a consistent, atmospheric observer, but her interiority remains largely retrospective and philosophical rather than immediate. She functions more as a vessel for the story's thesis than a protagonist navigating a pressurized crucible; her choices are contemplative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mara’s internal arc is coherent, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Compassion and self-respect could coexist") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional shift feels slightly smoothed over by this summary, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's internal landscape is rendered with clarity, and her motivation is established early. However, the emotional climax relies heavily on a rapid internal pivot ("settling into place like a puzzle piece") and diagnostic realization about her scars rather than a high-stakes decision in the moment. The resolution feels slightly more therapeutic than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira functions primarily as a passive camera for the backstory rather than an active protagonist. Her interiority relies on abstract summaries of her "gift" rather than embodied emotion or struggle, and her final choice to leave the reel feels low-stakes and pre-ordained rather than a hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("moonstruck dreamer") and metaphorical states rather than concrete, embodied traits. The internal conflict resolves through passivity (surrender) without a demonstrated cost or difficult trade-off, making the emotional arc feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions as an archetypal guardian, but her "dreamless" trait serves as a label rather than a driver of behavior or cost. Her resistance to the merchant is immediate and lacks internal friction or temptation, resulting in a flat emotional arc where her motivation is stated in dialogue rather than tested through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    Cyrus functions as a philosophical cypher rather than a fully realized character; he lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotions. His journey is purely linear—he seeks, he finds, he accepts—without internal resistance or distinct personal cost, resulting in a protagonist who observes rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific individual; her interiority relies on abstract summaries ("rooms of the heart") rather than concrete, embodied memory or sensation. The "leash" serves as a heavy-handed symbol for her trait rather than a tool for organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus is a deeply realized focalizer; his physical agony (nerve regeneration) is seamlessly braided with his psychological burden (the silent choir, the brother). The internal conflict between safety protocols and the urge to engage with the world is dramatized through specific micro-choices (picking up the bolt, lingering on the stair). The transition from avoidance to active pursuit is earned through high-quality interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a static figure of competence described through summary rather than a character making choices under pressure. There are no on-page micro-turns, contradictory impulses, or moments of vulnerability, resulting in a profile rather than a dramatized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer whose backstory of witnessing bleaching effectively colors her perception of the present. Her interiority is grounded, though the realization at the end leans slightly into diagnostic summary ("teaching her something else") rather than purely embodied change. The shift from observer to active participant via the tapping rhythm is a strong, character-specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's internal state relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "meaning had scattered into fear") rather than embodied emotion. The transition from doubt to "earned" certainty feels unmotivated by character agency, occurring instead through an external magical reaction that resolves the internal struggle without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Yara’s motivation shifts rapidly from lifelong secrecy to insurgent action without a dramatized internal struggle or distinct triggering cost. The emotional transition is smoothed over by summary rather than earned through on-page grappling with the danger she fears. The relationship with Anya functions primarily as a plot catalyst rather than a crucible for character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vividly embodied ("pulse of a dying seedling"), but the reliance on diagnostic language ("nervous system doing what it needed to do") creates a clinical distance that undercuts the raw grief. The character's agency is largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene, though the internal struggle is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira’s internal shift from "crestfallen" to "luminescent clarity" relies on a sudden, summarized epiphany rather than an earned emotional progression. The realization that fragmentation is a "gift" reads as diagnostic label-speak, resolving complex self-doubt with a tidy maxim rather than a dramatized struggle. While the portrait artist background effectively informs her perception, her competence is asserted through metaphor rather than tested by the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized; while his obsession is clear, his internal landscape feels expository. The attribute "albino-sensitized fingertips" reads as unexplained biological essentialism or magic rather than a grounded trait, and his immediate resignation to the phenomenon removes the struggle necessary for high-stakes characterization. There is no contradictory impulse or hesitation to give weight to his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is labeled ("bravely conflicted") rather than dramatized, which flattens the emotional arc. The realization and decision occur instantly ("in the blink"), depriving the character of a genuine moment of agency or oscillation under pressure. Interiority relies on stock physical reactions (trembling hands) and abstract summarization of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is idealized and static, lacking the "contradictory impulses" or internal friction required for high-band characterization. Her virtue is automatic—she is "senselessly perceptive" and infinitely patient—leaving no room for genuine struggle or a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Morwen’s established trait of "cool-headedness" anchors the surreal events, making his success with silence earned rather than convenient. The shift from fisher of fish to vessel for a god is a significant internal reconfiguration, grounded well in his patience and tool use. The realization of his purpose feels slightly teleological ("understood finally"), but fits the mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s internal landscape is drawn with precision, balancing the weight of generational guilt against a sharp, logical mind. The transition from accused victim to proactive investigator is earned through her specific trait of "devoted observation" and the application of her father's logic puzzle, making the shift feel character-driven rather than plot-convenient. The emotional cost—admitting that the rot is inside her own organization—is legible in her "solemn" reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira is defined primarily by her prompt-mandated profession and a singular note of grief, lacking the interior contradiction or specific desires that drive compelling characterization. Her actions are largely passive; she follows a trail of instructions—first the letters, then the firmware—rather than making difficult, character-revealing choices under pressure. The emotional arc is linear and inevitable, moving from yearning to resolution without any moment of doubt, hesitation, or conflicting impulse to humanize the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is clearly drawn, but the narrative relies on label-speak ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") rather than demonstrating these traits through interaction. The internal realization feels slightly abstract and diagnostic ("comfortable wound") rather than purely visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lysara is distinct, but her "gentle radical" persona is established primarily through labeling rather than dramatized conflict with her companions. While her internal state is vivid, her interaction with Soren relies on a sudden, intuitive recognition that resolves the scene without significant interpersonal friction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is grounded in a specific backstory ("suicide of hope") that generates credible empathy. However, the secondary character (Mira) remains largely passive, serving as a receptacle for the protagonist's aid rather than an active agent of resistance, which limits the dynamic range of the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira’s "affectionate skepticism" is a told trait that dissolves immediately without struggle when the plot requires belief; her acceptance of the magical element is too frictionless. The emotional journey lacks the contradictory impulses or genuine internal resistance that would earn the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    Maren lacks internal opposition or contradictory impulses; her journey is a smooth ascent to epiphany without difficult choices or potential for failure. The realization of her purpose feels granted by the narrator rather than earned through struggle or significant personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara functions as a static vessel for the premise rather than a character with contradictory impulses or flaws. Her method is validated without struggle or cost, and she faces no difficult micro-choices that test her values or demand sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.7)
    Character motivation is handled through diagnostic summary ("motivation had crystallized," "courage had not been destroyed") rather than embodied action or sensation. The internal state is explained to the reader via abstract labels, creating distance during what should be a visceral moment of waiting and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a passive observer whose motivation ("to distill complexity into essence") is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through conflict. There are no competing internal impulses or micro-choices under pressure; he simply waits and reflects until the external plot (the barge) resolves the scene for him.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.3)
    Mira is a passive vessel for the theme, defined by the label "phototropic to kindness" rather than by choices made under pressure. Her journey lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she arrives, observes, and understands without paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.4)
    Maren functions as a static mentor figure without internal contradiction or risk; her wisdom is accessible instantly, leaving no room for the struggle or cost required for high-band characterization. The child serves as a compliant prop for the lesson rather than a source of genuine pressure, resulting in an emotional arc that feels smooth and inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living character; her emotions are labeled ("grief," "loneliness") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The resolution stems from a passive epiphany rather than agency, leaving her internal arc feeling static despite the lyrical introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira is introspective and consistently drawn, with interiority that matches the lyrical tone. However, the emotional arc is smooth and lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; her transition from secret-keeper to public artist feels more like a convenient realization than a hard-won choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya is a highly competent protagonist who faces the external problem with efficiency, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful flaws. Her journey is a procedural success rather than a character test; she ends the story in the same emotional state she began, having paid no personal price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("claustrophobic," "prudently adventurous") rather than contradictory actions that reveal these traits under pressure. The claustrophobia is stated as an internal sensation but does not force a difficult trade-off or alter her tactics in the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's unique perceptual lens (face blindness turned into emotional insight) is established with strong interiority and concrete detail. Motivation is clear and poignant, though the execution of her "method" feels somewhat frictionless, relying more on her innate superpower than a struggle that forces a hard choice or adaptation in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    Maren is defined largely by labels ("idealistic," "nervously confident") rather than dramatized behavior. Her motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on summary and backstory (e.g., the copper nail explanation) rather than unfolding in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a lyrical vessel for the theme rather than a living character with agency or struggle. Her primary trait ("dynamically observant") is stated as a label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or specific insights that alter the outcome. Interiority relies on repetitive poetic framing ("particular silence," "particular shade") instead of embodied emotion, and her acceptance of the supernatural disappearance feels passive.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Character motivations are clear and the backstory (robber's son) effectively shapes Marcus's worldview and tactics. However, the dialogue feels slightly performative rather than natural, and Elena's rapid pivot minimizes the sense of internal struggle or deep resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions primarily as a thematic vessel; her three-year hesitation is implied rather than dramatized, leaving the final choice feeling inevitable and lacking in visible, conflicted internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kaelen’s internal landscape is legible, and his motivation for redemption is clear. However, the characterization relies heavily on summary and abstract labels (“guarded man,” “hubris,” “confession”) rather than embodied behavior or difficult choices in the moment. The solitary nature of the scene limits opportunities for his traits to be tested against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for destiny, lacking internal conflict or agency beyond a single inevitable assent. Her emotions are delivered via diagnostic labels ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") rather than embodied experience or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and drives the beat, but interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("architecture of being") rather than specific, embodied memory. The recurrence of the label "fiercely gentle" flattens the character's complexity into a repeated prompt phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus is a distinct, well-realized protagonist whose internal conflict—roadie instinct versus appraiser objectivity—drives the narrative efficiently. His motivation to reclaim purpose is palpable, though the interiority occasionally leans on diagnostic labeling ("insulating emotionally") rather than purely embodied reaction. The tension between his past and present selves creates a strong crucible for the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's internal conflict (ambition vs. understanding) is established but resolved primarily through the magical agency of the seed rather than an active struggle on the page. The "patient" trait acts more as backstory justification than a driver of choices under pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Asa functions as a passive vessel for the setting's routine rather than a character with agency; she faces no resistance, makes no difficult choices, and demonstrates no internal contradiction under pressure. Her "peace" and "serenity" preclude the struggle required for narrative characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    Margret is a functional vessel for the narrative but lacks deep contradictory impulses; her "bitter lesson" is stated in the opening, making the ending a confirmation rather than a discovery earned under pressure. The shift from bureaucrat to prophet of connection feels largely uncontested by her internal professional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rendered with tactile specificity ("trembling," "daringly methodical patience"). However, the shift from desperation to "self-forgiveness" feels slightly rushed and relies on diagnostic language ("survival, then stability") rather than dramatized behavioral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a passive observer who follows magical instructions without making a difficult choice or facing internal opposition. Her motivation is generic ("whispered promises"), and the label "cautious exuberant" is used as a shortcut for personality rather than demonstrated through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elena's internal conflict (empire vs. dream) is established primarily through exposition and the magical coffee-ground vision rather than dramatized behavior prior to the climax. While the motivation is clear, the "buried dream" feels summoned by the prompt rather than embodied in the character's initial state. The choice to play is a Decisive Change, but the emotional struggle leading to it relies heavily on the magical object telling her what she feels.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira functions as a competent procedural operator rather than a character under pressure. While her motivation is clear, she faces no internal conflict, difficult choices, or contradictory impulses. The outcome is achieved through established skill without personal risk or character-defining sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's characterization relies heavily on a large block of backstory summary (the brother's betrayal) rather than dramatized choice in the present moment. Her primary action—climbing a tree to think—is observational rather than agentive, lacking the contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority relies on diagnostic summary ("Vulnerability without protection was just trauma") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist's conflict is largely retrospective, recounting a past success (Thomas) rather than navigating a present-tense dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mina functions primarily as a receptive vessel for wisdom rather than a driver of conflict; her internal state is described through summary ("felt something shift") rather than embodied struggle. The Researcher is a strong archetypal presence, but the dynamic relies on traditional mentor-student tropes without subverting them.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype of stasis rather than a character with conflicting desires; she functions as a vessel for the setting rather than an agent of change. There are no active micro-choices or internal contradictions on the page, and the "peace" feels like a default state rather than a hard-won resolution to a specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is fundamentally passive, acting as a vessel for the plot rather than its driver. She unstraps a box and touches a stone, but the pivotal transition—mastering mist walking—happens to her "effortlessly" rather than through a high-stakes choice or earned struggle. The revelation of her competence feels like a convenient rewrite of her character traits rather than a dramatized development.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is a consistent, contemplative figure, but his passivity limits the score; he functions more as a vessel for the theme than a character making high-stakes choices. The "hiding behind truth" attribute appears as a label rather than a driver of behavior, and his primary action is waiting for an external epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kira functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophical concept than a living character under pressure. She lacks internal contradiction or conflicting desires; her transition from seeking to witnessing is a smooth intellectual shift rather than a hard-won emotional choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through abstract metaphors ("hollow space," "alchemy") rather than embodied reactions or specific memories. The "removed heart" backstory is a familiar trope that creates emotional distance rather than specific character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "lukewarm" nature and "earnest naivety" are well-established and drive the central action. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or grit; his "inadequacy" conveniently functions as his superpower without forcing a difficult trade-off or painful growth.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a character under pressure; her interiority is rich but largely confirmatory, lacking internal contradiction or high-stakes micro-choices. While her role as a warden is established, the central action (placing photos) meets no active resistance, resulting in a static procession rather than a dramatic arc with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the theme rather than an agent making difficult choices. Her "secretly sentimental" trait is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through resistance or costly action. The epiphany is achieved through observation (watching birds) rather than struggle, resulting in a character arc that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    The parachute buckle serves as an excellent objective correlative for the narrator's anxiety. However, interiority relies on diagnostic summary ("watcher's burden made manifest") rather than raw, embodied experience, creating distance during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("numb," "hollow," "ego death") rather than embodied sensation, creating a distance between the reader and the character's state. The emotional shift at the climax is instantaneous and unearned by prior on-page struggle, functioning as a mechanical switch rather than a credible psychological arc. The protagonist’s internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira's internal transformation is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told she shifts her design philosophy, but we do not see the specific moment of struggle or choice that earns this change. The commercial pressure is declared as backstory but never manifests as an on-page antagonist or obstacle forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal conflict or distinct personality traits beyond his role. His motivation is abstract and stated by the narrator ("He understood the delicate nature of the work") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or embodied emotion. There are no micro-choices under pressure; he simply executes a procedure without doubt or deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is described as "feral" but acts with serene, philosophical introspection, creating a disconnect between label and behavior. Her motivation shifts instantly upon touching the pendant without struggle or contradictory impulses, making the internal arc feel unearned. The "dimensionally homesick" trait operates as a diagnostic label rather than a lived, embodied experience driving difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("stoic sensitivity") rather than embodied emotion. The shift from hopeless struggle to epiphany feels slightly convenient, driven by the environment rather than deep character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara is a functional protagonist but lacks specific interiority; her emotions are labeled ("She wept") rather than embodied or earned by the immediate scene. Her epiphany feels abstract and unconnected to a defined internal struggle or flaw established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    Maren is defined by stated labels ("ardent," "resilient") rather than dramatized complexity. Her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal conflict; the climactic choice is automatic, driven by competence rather than a struggle between competing values. The absence of a felt personal cost for her heroism leaves the characterization functional but flat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—the erosion of her own memory by her creations—is compelling and well-motivated by the "fever dream" profession. The "personal confession" moment grounds the abstract concept in character stakes, though the emotional cost is summarized ("losses that felt genuine") rather than dramatized through a specific, visceral instance of memory failure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is a competent, unified focalizer, but she lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for higher bands. Her trait "balancedly curious" is told rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; her journey is smooth and meditative, lacking a moment where character flaws or limits create genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena is a functional protagonist with a clear role, but her shift from technician to "protector" relies on a sudden, summary realization rather than a dramatized pressure-test. The transition feels rushed, and her internal monologue leans heavily on romanticized exposition ("title that sounded romantic") rather than grounded psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maren's motivation shifts from skepticism to transcendent acceptance rapidly, but the internal logic holds. The claustrophobia serves as a functional counter-pressure, though it is articulated through "tell" phrases ("claustrophobia screaming at her") rather than purely visceral reaction in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s interiority is compelling, grounded by the specific, traumatic constraint of counting heartbeats. Her shift from anger to wholeness is earned through the ritual action, though the ghost's benevolent intent feels slightly convenient for the conflict's resolution. The "mother's face" choice effectively dramatizes her desire for connection over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s physical signature (copper veins) and sensory-focused interiority create a distinct presence that fits the story's texture. However, the "curse" and the ancestral bargain remain abstract backstory elements that do not exert concrete pressure or demand a visible price during the scene's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira functions primarily as a witness to the spectacle rather than an active agent with deep interiority; her acceptance of the bizarre situation is immediate and lacks friction or internal cost. The motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is articulated through expositional dialogue rather than dramatized through behavior or subtext. The emotional arc feels stated ("fear and wonder warring") rather than embodied in reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara functions more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a fully realized character; her interiority is comprised of abstract longing rather than contradictory impulses. While her desire is clear, she faces no difficult choices or internal resistance, succeeding in her quest through immediate intuition ("understood immediately") rather than struggle or sacrifice. The lack of a "crucible" moment where she must trade one value for another keeps her characterization static.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus is consistent, but the boy functions as a thematic prop rather than a genuine child. The dialogue ("You foster things by linking what's missing") is unnatural ventriloquism, where a character explicitly articulates the author's theme rather than speaking from their own limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific individual, defined by clichés like "hands that knew wood." His internal state is static, and the motivation to "interpret silence" is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Miriam acts as a competent functionary of the magic system rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions or meaningful risks. Her "eccentricity" is a label rather than a driver of costly choices, and her emotional arc is flat, marked by professional certainty rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with a clear internal landscape, but she lacks agency in the narrative present. Her defining actions—claiming the library, learning the magic—are summarized in backstory rather than dramatized as choices under pressure. The revelation of her own longing feels like an inevitable arrival rather than a result of difficult character work or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Motivation is stated ("fire behind patient eyes") rather than shown through costly choices; the protagonist acts as a functional vessel for the plot without internal contradiction or struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clear and drives the action, though the character's internal shift relies heavily on summary ("He had broken his habit of empirical distance") rather than purely dramatized choice. The "chronically curious" label is repeated as a trait rather than demonstrated through high-pressure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maren’s backward walking is a strong, embodied trait that grounds her internal conflict, but her interiority often relies on abstract labels ("relocation of the spirit") rather than visceral experience. The "warrior" persona feels slightly imposed on a low-stakes interaction, creating a mismatch between her self-concept and the gentle reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as an archetype rather than a specific character; she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or distinct personality beyond her role. Her actions are procedural and ritualistic, involving no difficult choices or pressure that would reveal character depth. The emotion is described abstractly ("tenderness," "devotion") rather than embodied in specific physical reactions or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's immediate understanding of the solution undercuts agency and struggle; the backstory of the father arrives late to force resonance rather than emerging organically from the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("perceptive map framer," "methodically curious") rather than dramatized traits. Motivation is asserted via exposition ("by nature") rather than shown through struggle under pressure, and the lack of embodied resistance makes her final renunciation feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Miriam's internal conflict is resolved too conveniently by the discovery of the note, creating a "magic words" epiphany rather than an earned psychological shift. While her affinity for the deep is well-established, her transition from obsession to "letting go" happens via summary ("she understood, finally") rather than through a dramatized, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization relies on summarized internal states ("Mira understood the motivation") rather than dramatized conflicting impulses. Mira is competent but static; she faces no difficult micro-choices that test her resolve or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s internal life is consistent, and the micro-choice to pry the goggles is successfully motivated by her established nature. The transition from curiosity to empathetic burden is earned, though the "warmly inquisitive" trait is told via label before being dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is distinct, but the "emotional cloud" categorization relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("cumulonimbus of grief," "cirrus of hope") rather than embodied emotion. The internal arc is clear, but the resolution feels more like a summarized epiphany than a hard-won psychological shift born of conflicting impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a character under pressure; she accepts the task and executes it without internal conflict, difficult choices, or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent, functional protagonist, but her "diligently curious" nature is asserted via label rather than dramatized through difficult choices. She faces no internal contradictions or genuine emotional risk; the investigation proceeds smoothly without forcing her to sacrifice anything significant.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    Thessa is an archetype serving a prophecy rather than a fully realized character; her motivation ("rhythm of repair") is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through struggle. She displays no internal contradiction or hesitation, even when sacrificing her tools, making the emotional arc feel flat and transactional. The "weathered peace" at the end feels unearned because the prior anxiety was only mentioned in a distant memory.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on collective summary ("residents") and brief, nondramatic sketches of individuals (Eli, Lena) rather than deep interiority or specific micro-choices. There is no dramatized scene where characters confront contradictory impulses under pressure; the emotional arc is told via exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a static archetype rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice, simply performing a ritual she is entirely at peace with. Her motivation is delivered through abstract summary ("document beauty") rather than dramatized through action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira's burden is established well through the "transfer of weight" description, though her internal conflict is resolved somewhat easily. The phrase "reluctant heart stirred against her will" is a shortcut for embodied struggle; a more specific hesitation or cost would heighten the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miriam’s specific scientific worldview is a strong anchor, grounding grief in molecular chemistry effectively. However, the secondary "symphonically minded" trait feels like an unintegrated, ornamental metaphor that clashes with the dominant chemical lens. The motivation to atone is clear, but the internal shift relies more on summarized thought than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist serves as a passive observer and thematic vessel rather than an agent under pressure; she experiences no internal contradiction or difficult choices. The lack of a "crucible" or competing desires results in a flat trajectory where the epiphany feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear motivation (seeking silence) that evolves into a purpose (endurance). The "sandpaper" metaphor effectively internalizes her role, and the final state of being "sturdy brittle" earns the character arc. However, the shift from reclusive exhaustion to the active labor of the cure feels slightly frictionless; the emotional cost of the "three days" is summarized rather than dramatized in a moment of doubt or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara is competent and active, but she functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character with internal friction. Her success is swift and lacks visible personal cost or doubt, making her trajectory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on exotic labels ("helix-minded," "deep-sea navigation") that are told rather than demonstrated through habit or choice. The protagonist experiences no internal conflict or resistance; the transformation is an instantaneous, unearned epiphany ("Then she understood") without emotional cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    Calyx is a distinct, competent focalizer with clear motivation rooted in obsession. However, the emotional arc leans on stated changes ("Calyx was no longer the young archivist") rather than dramatized struggle; the "cost" is primarily the backstory wait rather than an on-page price paid during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with a clear skill set and distinct worldview. However, she lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses; her path from desire to action is linear and unopposed by personal flaws or doubts. The "kinship" with the hedgehog feels asserted rather than dramatized through interaction or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is clearly defined but static; he functions primarily as a vessel for backstory and reflection rather than active choices in the present. The characterization relies heavily on told traits (e.g., "attribute of being thoughtfully precise") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is a consistent focalizer with well-rendered interiority, fitting the "eclectic pacifist" archetype seamlessly. However, her primary struggle is resolved through a somewhat magical technology rather than a hard character choice that forces a sacrifice of her principles or comfort. The shift to "theatrical sincerity" as a tactic feels abrupt and abstract rather than a grounded character motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's motivation (ambition vs. patience) is clear, but her internal struggle is reported via summary rather than dramatized in a specific scene. We are told of her "frustration" and "aversion" during the weeks of tending, but we do not witness a specific micro-choice or moment of near-failure that earns the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a camera; her motivation ("curiosity") lacks urgency or personal stakes. She faces no true internal or external opposition, making her final decision to leave the artifact feel like a default rather than a hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is a compelling, highly competent focalizer whose worldview ("air left fingerprints") permeates the narrative. Her interiority is distinct and professional, grounding the story in a specific intellectual tradition. While her choice to stay is driven by professional obsession rather than deep emotional vulnerability, the final stance of reading the "world's hidden mathematics" earns the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Yara serves as a functional vehicle for the ritual rather than an agent with internal conflict. She faces no difficult choices or trade-offs; her success is pre-ordained by the "whispered coordinates" and lack of opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kira's internal state is detailed, but her evolution relies heavily on introspection rather than pressurized choices. The shift from guilt to acceptance feels like a rationalization ("relics chose their keepers") rather than a transformation earned through active struggle or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maren functions more as a vessel for the story's philosophy than a living protagonist; her internal state is described through abstract concepts rather than contradictory impulses. While the "erasure of self" is a stated goal, the lack of resistance or personal cost—beyond the metaphysical—lowers the dramatic tension of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara's internal state (jittery, grieving) is established well, but her emotional resolution feels unearned by her own agency. The shift from nervous grief to "something warmer" and steady purpose occurs because an external apparition provides reassurance, rather than through a difficult internal choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira functions as a passive observer rather than an active agent; the central epiphany happens to her through looking rather than through a high-stakes choice. The narrative relies on diagnostic interiority ("liminal space," "emotional archaeology") to define her rather than dramatized action. The "shattered assumptions" result in a smile rather than a felt cost or struggle, reducing the emotional weight of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a complex individual; her primary trait is the label "wistful." Her decision to sacrifice herself is instant and lacks the internal friction or hesitation that would give the "latent sacrifice" emotional weight, resulting in a character who serves the plot rather than driving it with distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cael is consistent and his motivation is clear, but he lacks internal conflict or flaws; he is a somewhat idealized "humble craftsman" archetype. The summary mode prevents access to micro-choices under immediate pressure, offering instead a generalized overview of his persistence rather than a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's interiority is rich and specifically grounded in her profession as a sensory map maker. However, the climax relies on a somewhat diagnostic realization ("cyclically spontaneous dissociation") rather than a visceral emotional reaction to the immediate scene, making the epiphany feel slightly intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.3)
    Maren is a passive protagonist who "understands immediately" the supernatural logic rather than arriving at it through struggle or error. Her trait of being "reticent" is stated but does not complicate the interaction with Ashford, and she resolves the crisis without facing a genuine internal dilemma or making a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static archetype who faces no internal contradiction or resistance. His motivation is purely competent and joyful, lacking the conflicting impulses or difficult choices required to generate character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is distinct, with the "dye master" background enriching the voice and final realization. However, the central motivation (a consuming question about "magnetizing stories") feels abstract and imposed rather than organic, and the epiphany relies on diagnostic observation rather than dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is internally consistent and the voice is distinct, fitting the fable-like quality well. However, her agency is largely observational; she witnesses rather than deciding between difficult alternatives with visible cost. The maintenance role is clear, but the lack of friction or personal risk limits the character arc to a static portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation to save the realm is clear, and the internal cost of "burning memories" provides a solid emotional anchor. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("shattered mirror," "accumulating weight of absence") rather than specific, embodied psychology until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's struggle is summarized through backstory rather than enacted in the present moment, keeping the reader at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is a static observer with no conflicting desires or internal obstacles; she accepts the impossible bread with a calmness that feels unearned. There are no difficult micro-choices, only routine actions that confirm her established state rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist serves as a consistent observer, but her internal arc lacks friction; the transition from dreading oblivion to accepting evolution happens instantly ("Yet as she observed... a different kind of meaning began to emerge") without a dramatized struggle or cost. The "gently meticulous" trait is stated and demonstrated but feels somewhat static, lacking the complexity of contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara is largely reactive, spending most of the word count waiting or recalling backstory; while her patience is established, her agency is limited until the final micro-choice, which feels more like hesitation than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's skepticism is asserted via labels ("luminous skeptic," "scientific part") rather than enacted; she navigates by tasting copper and accepting magical voting trees without genuine resistance. The internal conflict is summarized ("warring with the evidence") rather than dramatized through a costly micro-choice that tests her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("I was always the technical one") rather than dramatized friction, flattening the emotional arc. The immediate acceptance of the sister's motivation lacks the psychological struggle or denial that would earn the final realization. The "mnemonically gifted" trait functions primarily as an exposition device for backstory rather than a constraint that forces difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira functions effectively as a vessel for the theme, but her internal life lacks on-page contradiction or struggle. Her motivation is clear, yet her journey is linear; she observes and accepts rather than grappling with a difficult choice that tests her resolve. The emotional weight is largely carried by the memory of the master rather than Mira's immediate, embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara functions as a static archetype rather than a character with agency; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choices. Her "satisfaction" is declared at the beginning and reaffirmed at the end without testing or transformation. The arrival of Juniper provides affirmation rather than friction, leaving Elara's motivations purely abstract and undramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cara’s interiority is distinct, but the "circuit of her heart" line is a cliché that flattens the character into a trope. The transition to "strangely organic" is asserted via narration ("pulsed," "blood") rather than demonstrated through physical resistance or biological cost during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the plot, characterized chiefly by her job title and a generic "curiosity." She faces no internal contradiction, makes no difficult choices (the investigation is effortless), and pays no emotional or tangible cost for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira is a competent protagonist, but she lacks active agency in the scene; she merely executes a plan rehearsed years ago without facing new decisions or on-page dilemmas. While her backstory of "voice as collateral" is compelling, it functions as exposition rather than a pressure point driving immediate choices. The lack of internal conflict or hesitation makes her feel idealized and static, as she overcomes the environment with stated "ease" rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is functional but passive; her journey feels like a railroaded procession toward a predetermined realization rather than a struggle born of conflicting desires. The "revelation" that her mother was a keeper is delivered via exposition rather than earned through interaction or difficult choice. Interiority relies on summary ("Mira had never understood why") rather than dramatized emotional contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is rich and consistent, effectively grounding the summoner's perspective. However, the pivotal realization—that prophecy is frequency—feels asserted as an intellectual epiphany ("She understood now...") rather than earned through visceral struggle or on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation transitions organically from mundane necessity (sugar) to existential hunger (learning the building's language). Elena’s internal conflict—curiosity versus the preservation of a delicate friendship—resolves in a decisive, embodied micro-choice (touching the hand) that cements the relationship’s terms. The tutor’s portrayal balances "nimble" presence with the weight of being "dead," avoiding spectral clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira is defined by a label ("skeptic") that dissolves instantly upon contact with the inciting object, bypassing the dramatic potential of genuine resistance or struggle. Her internal state is described through summary rather than demonstrated through conflicting choices, making her acceptance of the supernatural feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.0)
    Yuki functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character with agency; she accepts the premise "immediately" without struggle or doubt. The epiphany regarding her complicity is stated as a philosophical conclusion rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or emotional resistance. Internal conflict is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("listener of echoes") and backstory rather than active choices in the present moment. Her passivity dominates the scene; she merely waits for a celestial event and reflects on past findings, offering no contradictory impulses or dramatized struggle to ground her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a static archetype with no active agency or internal contradiction on the page; she observes and reflects but makes no difficult choices. Her motivation is delivered via abstract summary ("sought to salvage") rather than dramatized through struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.0)
    Yuki is a clearly defined vessel for contemplation, but she lacks agency or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her primary internal conflict—keeping her father ignorant of the "architecture"—is noted but never tested in scene. Without a difficult choice or distinct vulnerability, she remains a static observer rather than a dynamic protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent, sharply defined professional, and her cynicism ("simpler and harder than believing") provides a strong filter. However, she lacks on-page internal contradiction or vulnerability; her reaction to the discovery is intellectual and summarized rather than viscerally felt, keeping the emotional stakes distant.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions primarily as a witness rather than an active protagonist; she waits, listens, and accepts the arrival without exerting agency or making a pressure-driven choice. The internal conflict regarding her "variant allegiance" is summarized in exposition rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs in the scene. While her isolation is established, her emotional arc is static, shifting from waiting to validation without a pivotal action that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's transformation is driven by an instant, unearned epiphany rather than internal struggle or pressure. The "redemption" relies on a backstory of "burned bridges" that is summarized but never dramatized, making the emotional stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("logical part... emotional part") rather than embodied complexity. The internal conflict is stated as a dichotomy but resolved through competence rather than a character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract summary ("sculpting patience from impatience") rather than dramatized choice or struggle. The protagonist's internal state is conveyed through labels like "restrained wildness" rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The decisive action feels pre-ordained by the setting rather than driven by a difficult personal choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's immediate, unquestioning acceptance of a supernatural vision contradicts her established "empirical observation" methodology and "watchfully calm" demeanor. This lack of internal skepticism or struggle against her training flattens the characterization into a convenient plot device. The ancestral backstory feels like a label applied to justify the lantern rather than a lived pressure that informs her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thomas is a coherent protagonist whose dual vocation drives the narrative logic; the specific choice to add the inscription is well-motivated by the reflection on the inmate. The internal conflict regarding "surface solution" vs. "deeper need" provides a solid anchor for the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct and the internal landscape is vivid, but agency is slightly undermined by the "yearning algorithm" acting as a puppet master ("did its work without my permission"). The character lacks significant internal conflict; the path from curiosity to discovery is linear, with the "madness" of others serving as backstory rather than on-page frictional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Maren is defined primarily by her job title and the repeated label "brightly attentive," which functions more as a plot device than a character trait tested under pressure. Her internal conflict regarding the restoration of the file is stated but resolved quickly without visible emotional struggle or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("courageous anomaly," "calm intuition") rather than dramatized behavior or difficult choices. Mira’s internal conflict is summarized in backstory ("shadows that laced through her work") rather than embodied in the present action. She functions as a passive recipient of magical insights rather than an agent navigating resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's specific background as an actuary contrasts effectively with her "loosened grip," creating a distinct internal landscape. Motivation is clear and poignant, though the opening transformation ("woke up changed") relies on summary rather than dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract summary ("inherited knowledge") rather than specific, embodied micro-choices in the present. The sudden shift to academic jargon ("intersubjective understanding") in the climax contradicts the established "weathered hands" persona, creating a severe voice/consistency break. The typo/artifact "她" instead of "she" in the fifth paragraph also disrupts the character illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization is static; Mira functions as a dutiful observer without contradictory impulses or present-tense struggle. Her motivation is explained through a memory rather than tested by a difficult choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    Maren acts as a passive vessel for the theme rather than a character with genuine agency or internal contradiction. Her motivation is abstract and stated in summary ("work was to help them remember") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or micro-turns. There is no felt cost to her actions; she performs a ritual without struggle, making the characterization flat and purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, contemplative figure whose interiority matches the story’s atmospheric tone. While his motivation to "decode" the pattern is clear, the stakes remain largely intellectual; the lack of a sharper, visceral cost or contradictory impulse lowers the tension. The emotional landscape is vivid but occasionally relies on labeled states (e.g., "penitent," "innocence") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira's internal landscape is compelling, and the trait of "precognitive forgetfulness" is not just a label but a rigorous constraint that dictates her behavior (the driftwood system). Her motivation is specific and poetic, driving the scene effectively. The epiphany feels earned through her prepared attention and ritual, though the struggle is largely navigational and internal rather than an active test of will against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator is distinct, but the interiority often slips into diagnostic self-analysis ("the problem was my understanding") rather than embodied feeling. This clinical distance dampens the emotional impact of the grief and the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal state is beautifully anchored by the diagnosis, which sharpens her motivation ("decisively kind") and grounds the sentimental aspects of her profession in concrete, personal stakes. Her response to Margery—a mix of professional duty and shared vulnerability—feels authentic and earned. The interiority avoids generic angst, replacing it with a "strange clarity" that drives the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear ("desperately to be worthy"), but her internal arc lacks friction; she moves from anxiety to success without confronting a contradictory impulse or making a costly choice. The desperation is stated in interiority rather than dramatized through a dilemma that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—loving a child she knew was a changeling—is deeply realized and drives the narrative without simplistic resolution. The "shrewdly innocent" trait is well-integrated into her worldview, though occasionally told rather than shown in high-pressure moments. The emotional progression from grief to a complex, laughing acceptance feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elira’s transition from grief to purpose is legible but occurs via instantaneous epiphany rather than a pressured struggle. Her internal state is often summarized using abstract labels ("pearl of stillness") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult on-page choices. The emotional arc feels smooth but lacks the grit of genuine psychological resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator's interiority is rich, but the "watchful dreamer" trait functions more as a stated label than a driver of active choice. While the decision to lie during the phone call (withholding the location) provides a valid micro-choice that defines the relationship, the character remains largely passive, observing the setting rather than acting upon it until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist relies on abstract emotional labels ("creative doubt," "shape of hope") rather than embodied distinctness. The pivotal interaction with the ghost mother feels sentimental and resolves the internal conflict without compelling a difficult, character-defining choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype (the reverence-filled keeper) rather than a dynamic character. She lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her actions are purely procedural, executing a ritual without hesitation, doubt, or the need to make a difficult choice that reveals values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara is competent and consistent, but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses in the scene. Her motivation is delivered via flashback summary rather than dramatized pressure, and she faces no genuine moment of doubt or difficult choice that tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elira is defined by high competence and poetic insight, but lacks the internal contradiction or blind spots required for higher bands. She encounters no genuine failure or resistance; her peripheral vision attribute functions as a key that unlocks the problem without struggle. The characterization is consistent but static, operating more as an archetype of wisdom than a flawed individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The weaver’s motivation is clear, grounded in a backstory of personal sorrow that compels her work. However, agency is low; the central "choice" to accept calcification is a reaffirmation of a past bargain rather than a fresh struggle, and the line "She did not resist" deflates potential internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal state is richly rendered, and the grief feels distinct and embodied ("hands remembered"). However, the explicit articulation of her wisdom in the "lessons were these" paragraph flattens her into a philosophical mouthpiece, momentarily distancing the reader from the lived experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is distinct and drives the accumulation of evidence; the internal conflict with the "ghost" effectively externalizes the struggle. The protagonist's resignation at the end feels earned by the prior physical accumulation of the camera's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mara acts as a competent problem-solver but lacks internal friction, contradiction, or a flaw that complicates her success. Her primary trait, being "functionally creative," is stated as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator’s epiphany feels diagnostic rather than dramatized; the shift from twenty years of blockage to acceptance happens instantaneously upon the bear's arrival without visible struggle. The internal conflict is resolved too tidily through abstract realization ("understood, finally, what peace might mean") rather than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype ("legend seeker") whose motivation is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The lack of visible, felt cost or internal contradiction makes her a vessel for the concept rather than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for philosophical abstraction rather than a character with embodied desires or internal conflict. The central realization feels unearned, arriving via magical epiphany rather than struggle or cost. Emotional resonance is asserted through labels ("felt the oceanic hush") rather than dramatized through distinct human reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is an intriguing vessel for the concept, but lacks internal friction; her immediate, poetic acceptance of being stranded dissolves the potential for visceral struggle or contradictory impulses essential for deep characterization.

    The prince’s internal state is clearly rendered, moving from nostalgia to a redefined purpose. However, the pivotal shift relies heavily on an instantaneous, convenient realization ("understood at last") triggered by the egg's message rather than a hard-won emotional struggle or deduction on the page. The "ache" and "trembling" feel slightly performative without more contradictory impulses to deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira is clearly drawn as a reflective figure, but she lacks internal contradiction or active flaws in the present moment; she reads as somewhat idealized ("unyielding compassion," "graceful alertness"). The conflict is largely retrospective, and her emotional state is summarized through diagnostic labeling ("transplanting her pain into purpose") rather than demonstrated through difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is labeled a "skeptic," yet she follows magical instructions with immediate, unquestioning compliance, undermining the central trait's potential for conflict. Her internal struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in choice; she acts as a passive vessel for the scavenger hunt logic.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vael functions primarily as a vessel for the aesthetic concept rather than a fully embodied character. While the "sentimentalist" trait drives the preservation of the gear, the internal crisis is resolved through summary ("Vael understood") rather than dramatized struggle or a difficult choice between genuine alternatives. The emotional arc feels observed from a distance rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara is a passive observer whose skepticism is mentioned as backstory ("dismissed it for years") rather than dramatized as an active resistance in the scene. Her transition to belief is smooth and immediate, lacking the contradictory impulses or emotional struggle required to make the "spectral mentorship" feel earned. The internal arc resolves through a stated realization rather than a difficult choice or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus's internal state is clearly defined, with physical grounding in the "ache in his chest" and "fingers anticipating." However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summarized labels ("grammar of his grief," "hollow resonance") rather than contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The moment of "emergence" feels more like a scheduled realization than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a passive observer defined by labels ("blithe spirit") rather than embodied action. His motivation is attributed to a sudden realization of destiny ("realized this was what he had been called to do") rather than character-driven desire or prior struggle. He faces no difficult choices, functioning merely as a vessel to decode the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions as a static archetype rather than a living character; she exists to articulate a philosophy rather than navigate a dilemma. There are no competing impulses or micro-choices under pressure; she begins the scene intending to write and ends it writing, with no internal alteration or cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on exposition and retrospective summary rather than present-tense action. Mira lacks internal contradiction or competing impulses; her "thistled calm" renders her static, and she faces no difficult micro-choices that would reveal depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("crystallized a fleeting emotion," "sorrow that felt almost sacred") rather than embodied, contradictory feeling. The realization is intellectualized through summary rather than earned through a high-stakes emotional struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a coherent vocal presence with a clear worldview, but they remain static. Emotions are stated ("I agonize," "I feel the weight") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult choices in the moment. The "madness" is described as neighborly opinion rather than a dramatized psychological pressure, leaving the character as a fixed intellectual stance rather than a person in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Eleanor is a clearly defined presence with a coherent worldview, but her characterization relies heavily on summary and backstory rather than present-tense struggle. She functions more as a wise archetype than a conflicted protagonist under pressure; her internal state is settled ("decades of unlearning") rather than active, limiting the emotional stakes of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elena is consistent but functions more as a vessel for the premise than a driver of action; her motivation is reactive (answering a call) rather than forged through agency. The pivotal choice to consume the seed feels pre-destined by the "alignment" rather than a difficult decision with conflicting internal impulses. There is no moment where her desire for knowledge clashes with a genuine fear or cost, limiting character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions as a competent focal character, but her defining trait of "involuntary truthfulness" acts more as a plot device to facilitate exposition than a flaw that forces difficult tradeoffs. The child, Mira, lacks age-appropriate voice or interiority, serving instead as a mouthpiece for the author's thematic assertions ("You preserve wonder in routine") rather than a distinct character.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is introspective and consistent, though the "creeping normality" label feels slightly external to the established voice. The lack of interpersonal or internal friction limits depth; she observes rather than struggles, resulting in a character who processes the world without risking much within it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.3)
    Thalassor’s internal landscape is vivid, but his transformation feels like a software update triggered by the ampoule rather than an earned emotional struggle. The shift from rigid guardian to nuanced witness occurs through received epiphanies rather than high-stakes micro-choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maren's motivation is clear and consistent, fitting the "grim optimist" archetype well. However, her interiority relies heavily on summary and abstract emotional labels ("vertigo of understanding") rather than embodied visceral experience. The transition from prisoner to explorer feels like an intellectual calculation rather than a deeply felt character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is consistently drawn as a gentle, obsessive figure, but her internal shift relies on a sudden, magical vision rather than earned psychological progression. The epiphany feels externally granted by the brush and moon rather than excavated through character agency or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s transition from museum guide to resistance leader is motivated and clear, rooted in the specific backstory of the beekeeper. However, her resilience is often summarized ("found solace in the patterns of survival") rather than dramatized in the moment, making her resolve feel slightly more archetypal than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Iris is a compelling, singular focalizer whose obsession with time’s reversal is thoroughly embodied in her craft and worldview. Her motivation—escaping a foreseen death—anchors the surreal premise in a concrete, urgent need. The internal contradiction between her precise patience and her desperate desire for annihilation adds depth to her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s internal conflict—the tension between the miracle of resurrection and her secret desire for death—is compelling and well-dramatized. The climax, where she confesses ("unbosoms") this dark truth to break the curse, demonstrates strong agency and psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined solely by her competence and role, lacking internal contradiction or contradictory impulses. She faces the central event with practiced mastery rather than struggle, and her choices carry no visible emotional or tactical cost. The "burden" of her gift is asserted in exposition but never dramatized through difficult tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent protagonist, but her internal landscape lacks friction; her defiance of the Council is presented as a settled fact ("knew better") rather than a weighed risk in the moment. The attribute of "patience" acts more as a label than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off during the scene's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dr. Vance is consistently characterized as a rational intellectual, and her internal monologue coheres with this identity. However, the emotional cost is stated in abstract terms ("processed emotion through... rigorous channels") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or behavior. The character feels monolithically resolved from the start, lacking the visceral inner contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren's interiority is consistent, but her motivation is articulated through explicit labeling ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than purely through organic pressure. The internal shift feels slightly unearned, relying on a convenient discovery to validate a pre-existing desire rather than forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a character with deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses. While her "tranquil perceptiveness" is established, her journey is smooth and observational, lacking the struggle or difficult choices that reveal character under pressure. The motivation is clear but remains abstract until the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is a strongly realized focalizer with deep interiority and a consistent emotional baseline of grief. While her motivation (endurance/memorial) is clear, her agency is expressed primarily through ritual maintenance (Earned Stasis) rather than dynamic choice-making, which limits the dramatic range in a short scope. The characterization is vivid but static.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending scientific detachment with raw trauma, though the motivation ("hunting unused potential") feels abstract and slightly performative. While the internal state is vivid, the characterization occasionally drifts into diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied reaction to the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation ("frequency of belonging") is abstract and lacks visceral urgency; the "perpetually surprised" trait is stated ("expression perpetually surprised") but does not constrain choices or drive behavior under pressure. The character functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living agent with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.6)
    Maren’s motivation is clear, but her agency is limited to sifting and remembering; she functions more as a vessel for backstory than an active protagonist making hard choices under pressure. The internal conflict is described with abstract labels ("ache," "guilt") rather than dramatized through distinct, embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist enters the scene with his primary choice already made ("He had decided, over many sleepless nights"), leaving no active struggle or contradictory impulses to dramatize on the page. The internal state is conveyed through summarized backstory and abstract labels ("burden," "familiar word") rather than embodied reaction to immediate pressure. The lack of hesitation or new tactical decisions during the encounter makes the character feel like a vessel for a pre-determined conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is legible, but the emotional pivot to "merriness" relies on summary rather than embodied sensation. The list of regrets ("She had regretfully...") functions more as a biographical catalog than a pressurized dramatization of internal conflict in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    Vera functions as a passive vessel for the concept rather than an active agent. While her internal state (the clean slate) is established, she navigates the story by following instructions and moving patiently rather than making difficult, character-defining choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lysara's internal conflict is stated ("feared its price") but resolves with minimal friction as the cost is immediately reframed as a "blessing." The "animal heart" remains an abstract concept rather than a visceral shift in behavior or perception, keeping the characterization at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the emotional climax relies on diagnostic internalization ("She understood then that...") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels downloaded rather than earned through the scene's action, utilizing therapy-speak ("debts are paid not by accumulation but by acceptance") that distances the reader from the felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Seraph’s interiority is rich and cohesive, effectively grounding the "pacifist by design" history in her movement and worldview. The unique physical trait ("gravitationally lighter when happy") is well-integrated into the character's physiology and the final beat. However, the character arc lacks active internal friction in the present moment; her choice to stitch feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by labels ("destitute philanthropist") and abstract backstory rather than on-page agency. Her passivity ("it happened to her, not because of her") and the diagnostic self-analysis at the climax ("She had come to understand transformation") flatten the emotional arc into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's transition from loyal sentinel to revolutionary leader occurs instantly upon reading a note, lacking dramatized internal conflict or doubt. The trait "calmly inventive" is applied as a repetitive label rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure, making the competence feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivation (grandmother's promise) is strong, but the "precognitive curse" is delivered via an expository summary block rather than being dramatized through constraint in the present action. The final emotional shift ("weight but a wing") relies on this summarized trait rather than an on-page struggle, making the internal arc feel slightly engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but delivered through abstract summaries ("paradox had sustained her") rather than dramatized choice. Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels and metaphors ("counting syllables into truth") instead of embodied emotion, creating a distance that intellectualizes her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.7)
    Varn is portrayed as a competent master, but he lacks internal conflict or vulnerability. The opponent serves as a straw man for "rigid doctrine" rather than a fully realized character, reducing the emotional stakes. The protagonist's flawlessness parries any genuine sense of risk or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    Character voices are distinct and the emotional connection feels earned through shared vulnerability. However, Mira's "lunar personality" condition functions more as backstory flavor than a source of immediate, dramatized friction or high-stakes choice in this specific scene. The emotional arc is touching, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into stagey philosophical territory.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with a specific, poignant motivation (the unplanned encore). The internal conflict—holding onto grief versus the passage of time—is clearly drawn, though the "wistful pianist" archetype leans slightly into romanticized tropes. The backstory of his "strategic choices" is summarized rather than dramatized in the present moment, distancing the reader slightly from his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, and the shift from verification to trust constitutes a legible stance change (Conceptual Repricing). However, the interiority relies on sentimental abstractions ("heart could name") rather than specific psychological friction, and the epiphany arrives via magical transmission rather than a hard-won active struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.7)
    Marek is largely passive, serving as a vessel for observation rather than active choice; the realization arrives via external phenomena (wind, light) rather than internal struggle or decision. The "slow-spoken" trait is told in exposition rather than demonstrated through interaction, and his emotional arc relies on abstract labels ("questions left unanswered") rather than embodied contradictory impulses.

    Strong interiority through embodied details like the thread's warmth against her thigh and contradictory reverence for farewells amid her own stranding; motivation to map absences compels the closing endurance of staying with felt cost. Minor diagnostic phrasing in reflections slightly abstracts peak realization, but micro-choices in writing earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong interiority via embodied ache ("chest ache") and contradictory impulses (destroy Engine vs. integrate), earning final renunciation; hypothesizing reveals flaws without safety-hedging. Minor slip in abstract labels like "bittersweet ache of partial understanding" borders on diagnostic but doesn't flatten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong embodied interiority (sand on cheek evokes father) and earned endurance in final rise, with contradictory impulses (restlessness vs. compassion) shown through micro-choices like gripping coin. Minor slip: limited on-page pressure for micro-choices, tilting reflective over conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. trail-following) shown in embodied glow shifts and cataloguing; final transformation earned by patient unsticking without epiphany dump. Micro-choices reveal values hierarchy, like sitting with sidereal patience at first fountain.

    Vael's otherworldly sentimentality drives ritual micro-choices like catching the petal and final ping, earning a reconfiguration of duty amid contradictory longing and mechanical intrusion; embodied through translucent hand and sonar, though internal conflict remains more perceptual than simultaneously acted.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Concrete interiority via squeaking shoes and whorls of wood grain; contradictory impulses (prior delusion dismissal vs. felt presence) yield earned realization at poem recitation, foreclosing denial with eternal carving cost.

    Gardener's tender handling of the case and tapestry reveals consistent traits of care amid the silent dead; realization in "He had spent his life among the silent" earns closure via prior causality without contradiction, though blithe spirit feels slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority concrete and particular via cartographic patterns and embodied quill weight; contradictory humility/audacity impulses act in hovering hesitation before writing. Final commitment earned through feather-to-quill progression. Minor reflection overbalance slightly abstracts peak agency.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira's motivation rooted in patient preservation intensifies credibly to the dust discovery and tonight's broadcast; interiority concrete via embodied details like mist acclimation and glow affection.

No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, slightly limiting 9+; endurance feels earned without deep flaws complicating peak.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses act in the ritual—Mira presses portrait to chest before burning, embodying desire for wholeness against acceptance of incompleteness—with final endurance of elusive truth earned via prior micro-choices and felt in tears.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong interiority rooted in obsession with evidence, revealed concretely through cog handling and refusal of official narrative; embodied in patient salvage amid isolation.

    Eleanor's motivation to braid voices emerges concretely from trauma-rooted ritual (thumb on rosette); internal conflict in unlearning hatred shows contradictory impulses via patient teaching. Student's resigned posture forces micro-choice in scale lesson, revealing hierarchy of values. Closure endurance earned with felt cost of years' subtraction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority shines in chef's hands "remembering the language of pruning," tying gift to motivation; earned change via seed-tasting forecloses commodified path with felt cost of carrying flame. Minor backstory summary early slightly abstracts conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's involuntary truthfulness embodies contradictory impulses in her honest doubt ("They won't believe me") against Mira's push, earning her climactic climb and purpose shift with relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Character defined sharply through noticing displacements like tilted photos and handprint warmth, rooting motivation in grandmother's teaching; interiority concrete and embodied without therapy-speak; earned stasis in accepting inheritance via shard's warmth shows micro-choices under pressure, though contradictory impulses act more implicitly than simultaneously in pivotal cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thalassor's internal conflict between rigid guardianship and emerging nuance acts simultaneously through embodied stone perceptions and telepathic shifts; final renunciation of certainty feels earned by ampoule-triggered revelations. Contradictory impulses peak in welcoming the diver without warning. No unearned epiphanies; flaws like past "incisively kind" judgments drive compassionate evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dice rolls and hypotheses reveal rigorous yet daring traits under isolation, earning shift from escape to exploration; minor label-speak like "balancedly daring nature" slightly abstracts interiority without embodied contradiction in pivotal insight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority concrete via trembling fingers and loud breath under charged air; methodical hope compels decoding until epiphany. Change from loneliness to hopeful sleep earned by prior symbol work. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in pivotal revelation beat.

    Maren's concrete rituals (baking initials, lens use) embody historical solace turning to defiant resolve, with dread contradicting hope in closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's interiority shines in embodied dread (skin glow, clasp's cold press), with contradictory impulses—embrace water's death vs. forward movement—culminating in earned confession. Minor diagnostic edge in advisor's definitions slightly undercuts raw crisis feel, but micro-choices reveal values without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Concrete interiority in acoustic readings and embodied strikes reveals particular prophetic traits; endurance of gift/burden earned but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's quiet determination and contradiction with Council drive micro-choices like blowing the whistle, embodied in palm tremor and reed handling. Interiority particular via pattern obsession and mentor loss. Final agency earned by prior persistence; no safety-hedging in blind defiance of Priestesses.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong consistent motivation rooted in patient cataloging that compels the final resolve; interiority concrete via embodied perceptions like worn stamp handle. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene for 9+; epiphanic shift feels serene without raw friction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses embodied in mundane urination humiliating survival and overthinking wife's death; final endurance hunt earned via reflective micro-choices tying geode to perturbation theory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's sharp eyes and perpetual surprise trait drive concrete perceptions like tracing letters and catching tool marks, revealing character under pressure. Interiority particularizes motivation for belonging through embodied wonder, culminating in earned realization she's the missing piece. Childhood trait anchors without excess reflection, tilting present choices like climbing the stair.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong embodied guilt (ache in chest, hands tremble, ribs pressed) roots motivation in consistent traits, with final remembrance earned via sifting micro-choices; minor slips in alternating summaries of internal conflict prevent higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization excels in embodied inheritance of guilt, with micro-choice to drop the pull earning the final untethering; contradictory impulses surface in hesitation over ritual's end.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strength: contradictory fear/readiness impulses act via spice-crushing micro-choice, earning expansion as bridge; embodied grief via tasted/scented memories avoids labels.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction embodied in ritual actions like pressing palm to cloth amid guilt; final acceptance earned through blood-ink mingling, revealing hierarchy of values with irreplaceable cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously without alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Steadfast pacifist trait compels non-violent stitching climax, earning integration of shadow with embodied gravitational lift as visible cost; contradictory grief/joy impulses act in scene without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority concrete and embodied ("heart ache with recognition"); motivation rooted in prior acts (signing away estate) compels uncorking jars as micro-choice under eclipse pressure. Final becoming ("destitute and luminous") earned via accumulative walk. Minor diagnostic edge in epiphany line but doesn't flatten contradiction between holding/releasing light.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's calmly inventive trait roots clear motivation, shown in methodical tracing of sundial angles amid blackout chaos, compelling her discovery; micro-choices like rotating the quill reveal hierarchy of values. No simultaneous contradictory impulses act in scene—steady competence lacks embodied struggle—preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Embodied curse ("visions that burned behind her eyes like embers") and promise as "second heartbeat" create contradictory impulses acting in the reach, earning the transformative stasis with visible cost of all star dust.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses of "furiously tranquil" act in the stormlit vigil, earning the final writing act with the cost of years' silence visible in the self-imposed pause.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong interiority and motivation rooted in Varn's philosophy, with mechanical arm embodying past struggle and present advantage; contradictory grace vs. intensity shown in duel. Minor slip in overt telling of traits like "diplomatically fierce" without deeper embodied cost at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)

Final merging of dreams earned by causal buildup of legacy and journey. No unearned epiphanies; interiority concrete and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority via embodied patience (wind drying hands, eyes closed to wind); traits shown concretely through bonsai precision and subtle pattern-noticing. Minor slip: realization feels more receptive than actively chosen, but endurance of regret-to-forgiveness arc earns closure with felt cost. Contradictory impulses (regret vs. diffusion) act in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—equations vs. the butterfly’s ambiguous fade—is embodied and sustained. The micro-choice to sit on the overturned pot crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses the “dramatic narrative” lens forever. The shift from observer to humbled witness is earned; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes. What keeps her from 9+ is the absence of a second beat where her new stance is actively tested under fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is sensor-rich and glass-maker specific; the shift from hunted to hunter is credibly seeded. Still, the moment of resolve (“she understood finally”) is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her new stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene—grief simply “loosens” without visible friction. Meets the 9+ test only partially; the final choice is declared, not earned on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s embodied silence and her tactile relationship with the tuning-fork case give her a sharp, consistent interior voice; the moment she lowers the sensor and closes her eyes, her earned renunciation of sound-recovery for “listening by architecture” crystallizes with visible cost. The “capsize survivor” tag never converts into an on-page memory or flaw that complicates present action, so the interior contradiction stays more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aldric’s quiet refusal of modern embalming crystallizes into a vocational philosophy that survives the surreal transition; the aching rib-cage motif migrates from habitual fatigue to spiritual vocation without interiority ever slipping into label-speak. The lens in his lap becomes both tool and mirror, forcing micro-choices—touch, listen, release—that chart an invisible moral ledger. Stubbornness, weariness, and caretaker instinct braid into one irreplaceable sensibility; remove Aldric and every beat collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s gently-persistent trait is embodied in every beat—midnight runs, basket notes, bell-ringing—so motive never abstracts into label. The moment she watches Farouk kneel without prompting crystallizes her legacy stake and shows contradiction resolved in action. Interiority stays concrete: “particular grief of proximity” felt through lit valley, not declared. One decimal off 8.7 only because the grandmother hand-off, though evocative, is recalled summary, not dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mei’s interiority is vivid—body-level memory of salt, trembling hands—but the “camera obscura artist” identity is mostly label; we never see her actually adjust aperture, mix chemistry, or solve a problem the tool poses. The decisive breath-rhythm choice feels arrived at rather than struggled through; no micro-choice visibly risks failure or forfeiture, so the cost is inferred, not embodied. Still, the saffron-robed past-life grief is specific enough to lift her above stock. Strong interior contradiction present, but second half slips into therapeutic summary (“rhythm of healing”).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile attention to vines, dirt drawing, and the fragment against her palm grounds motive. Yet the leap from “stop disintegration” to “design a maze that traps time’s texture” feels slightly abstract; the causal bridge between obsession and final micro-choice is implied more than dramatized. Still, her embodied awe and the trembling garden response give a palpable cost to the on-page renunciation (she commits to the maze), earning an 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s patient-strategic trait is credibly lived-in; the three-year decoding effort shows endurance, not tell. Yet her interiority stays general—“keeper of futures,” “stubborn miracle”—rather than revealing a contradictory impulse under the vault’s hush. Because no second character shares the scene, the crucible is purely situational; her embodied cost registers as the awkward chains and slowed descent, but the beat stops short of a micro-choice that forecloses one seed option over another. Still, the silent catechism of keys gives her a memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s synesthetic engineering motive is vivid, but the David-memory block is recounted more than dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene shows trust fracturing, so the interior contradiction is told, not embodied under pressure. The final quiet smile is credible renunciation yet reads lightly costed because the forge’s supernatural logic externalizes the labor.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation and worldview are vivid, but interior contradiction is asserted (“stolen / borrowed”) rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final smile registers as beatific completion, not costly renunciation; no visible flaw complicates her craft. The man’s shift is observed from outside, so the emotional price lands on him, not her, keeping her arc inert. Earned stasis is hinted but not paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glassblower’s interior contradiction—yearning for open inquiry while armoring himself in isolation—is rendered through embodied, glass-specific beats (the kettle burn scar, the reverent pipe carry). Yet no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is a solo thaw whose cost is felt but not forced into an external choice. Reflection stays anchored to the cracked bookmark and melting ice cues, avoiding therapy-speak. The final stance crystallizes credibly: he will “begin again,” having traded frozen detachment for pliable risk. Still, the absence of a live opposition keeps the stakes interior-only, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s claustrophobia and stunt history are shown through tactile memory and present-tremor, not label-talk; the “trembling certainty” line lets fear and power coexist on the page. The micro-choice to read the cast while shelves press in embodies both phobia and stunt-honed nerve, earning her final stance. Daniel’s shift from mentor to captor is legible in one beat of honeyed condescension. Cost is felt: she will flee the library still trembling, but now armed with a self she chose.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle’s interior contradiction—urgency to map darkness vs. acceptance of silence—drives every micro-choice; her trembling hands, charcoal lift, and final smile embody a lifetime of obsession with cost paid in death. No second character on stage, so status crucible N/A; the lone POV sustains pressure through embodied stillness. The renunciation of speech for silence is earned across the text and forecloses any future testimony, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is poetic but abstract; “something it could only categorize as curiosity” keeps feeling at arm’s length. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the robot simply decides to play. The final acceptance is asserted, not earned through a visible trade-off. Composure trait is named repeatedly but never costs the robot anything on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    The registrar’s patience and belief in “presence itself” are credibly grounded; the choice to draw in the final beat visibly costs him his detachment. Interiority is character-specific (“ambiguously clear” worldview). The micro-choice to return Mira’s ticket/hand-touch is earned, but the prior beats are mostly receptive—he watches, pockets, polishes—so the decisive shift feels late. Still, the arc from passive keeper to active participant lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s patient, pragmatic persona is vivid and embodied in the tactile ritual of polishing marbles; her refusal to guide the villager crystallizes her earned stance. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment puts her patience in direct jeopardy—so the arc is more portrait than crucible. The choice to misdirect investors is summarized, not dramatized, blunting motivation’s causal edge. Still, her consistent micro-choices (polishing, planting, pocketing marbles) tether motive to action with economical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kira’s obliging nature is shown through tactile ritual, but the “mechanically warm” trait is stated, not tested; the moment she proves sideways time, her interiority flatlines into summary awe rather than a contradictory stance with cost. No micro-choice after the discovery reweights her identity or future; the closure beat is purely observational.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s grief-anchored refusal to leave the pit is credibly rooted in eleven years of identity and the uncanny return of Marco’s handwriting; the cello case prop and her knee-deep wade to the piano show embodied risk. Yet the interior register drifts into abstract mission-speak (“instrument of its revelation”) that blurs the cost she actually pays—no irreversible loss is staged beyond wet shoes and a spectral chat. The final renunciation—walking away while the lanterns keep flickering—earns a quiet stasis, but the contradiction between “had to do” and the lack of tangible consequence keeps her arc just short of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the need to keep forecasting—stays embodied in fever-raw mouth, trembling hands, aurora-lit frost. The smudge-touch is a micro-choice that tilts her stance; grief’s weight is measured in the exact moment she swallows it and issues the warning. Earned endurance costs her the last of her self-exculpation, foreclosing the escape route of resignation. All motivation stays strictly character-bound; no therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s skeptical bent and hunger for confession are cleanly dramatized through micro-choices—crawling into the tunnel, lingering on the wheel, finally speaking. His interior contradiction (rational disbelief vs. need for absolution) remains active in-scene and drives the climax. The swallowed-truth motif is embodied, not labeled. Cost is felt in the hush after he speaks, but the beat is a hair under-physical; a sharper bodily cue would clinch 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.5)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“gripped reality loosely…clutching water”), but the keeper is a passive witness; no contradictory on-page impulses or rising-stakes choice appear, so the required “earned renunciation/change with cost” is absent. The final stance remains unchanged from the first paragraph, giving the piece a static rather than arc-driven protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective caretaker vs. risk-taking witness—co-exist in the granite moment; Maya’s unprompted hand-touch crystallizes earned trust. Reflection is tied to present eclipse stimuli and alters her micro-choice to stay silent, satisfying BRR. The final squeeze carries visible relational cost, but the interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak (“nurture lifelong wonder”) that blunts edge under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “oddness” is evoked rather than dramatized; he never makes a micro-choice under pressure that reveals interior contradiction. The final hopeful turn (“perhaps there were still dreams enough in stories”) is asserted, not earned by an on-page sacrifice or risk. His motivation to “collect stories walls have heard” remains static; nothing forecloses an alternative path, so no cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s ex-spy turned fortune-writer identity is vivid through tactile micro-habits (folding cookie wrappers like microdots) and interior contradiction, but the arrival of two off-page strangers at the end is accepted without an on-page micro-choice that costs him anything; the renunciation stays abstract, so the final cost is felt only generically, not personally.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    Father Matthias’s investigative motive is clear and sustained, but the piece withholds any micro-choice that alters his tactics once the threshold walk begins; Gabriel remains off-page, so the priest’s interiority never meets embodied opposition. The promised “questions” never materialize as a concrete on-page beat, so the climactic step feels pre-decided rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elira’s temporal displacement is lyrically evoked, yet her interior contradiction stays summary: “uncertain whether the day before had been real” never collides with a single embodied moment of disorientation under pressure. The nautilus shell is handled twice but does not alter her tactics; the final fortune is written with serene certainty rather than a visible cost extracted from her fragmenting mind. Because the stakes are existential but the beat-level choices are abstract, the arc reads as mood rather than motivated character change.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically particular—"gravity-defying curse that marked her as different"—and the tablet-driven retracing dramatizes a hierarchy of values (integration > escape). Yet the cost of her "periodically eternal" fracture is asserted rather than embodied; no micro-choice on the page visibly hurts her. Still, the final line’s shift to agency ("she would be the one who had dropped it") earns a credible renunciation of passivity. Passes quick test but emotional jeopardy stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—palming the phonograph to “read” reversed sound, the hush-filament turning from wall to door. The passage from numbness to somatic re-awakening is embodied beat by beat; the final resolve to teach others is earned and carries visible cost (her lifetime of normal hearing is gone). Koren remains functional, but his silent guidance is consistent with mythic mentor brief. No epiphany clichés; the emotional arc scales to word count.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized in her decoding of Marques’s note and her instant tactical pivot to the pigeons. The interiority stays concrete—fifteen years of storm journals transmute into witness, not abstract virtue. Her final resolve feels earned because the text lets us watch her price the risk against the jasmine scent she stands to lose. Minor slip: “credibly curious mind” is label-speak in the epiphanic paragraph (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mirabel’s interiority is textured—her aromatic caution, the ritual of uncorking, her fear of understanding—yet the final beat leans into a summarizing epiphany (“she grieved…truly grieved”) that slightly over-articulates what the luminous image already shows. The brother remains off-stage; his absence is the crucible, but because he never appears, relationship pressure is inferred rather than enacted, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate. Micro-choices (perfume vial handling, deliberate footsteps) anchor motive, but the decisive interior shift is told more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s “ethically playful” streak is shown only in back-story summary; the grotto scene itself gives her no boundary to test, so interior contradiction stays theoretical. The final renunciation is credible because the rope’s glow externalizes the cost, but the beat is one beat too quiet—no micro-choice inside the moment that dramatizes the loss of either option. Still, her voice is specific enough to lift the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied (“held against her chest like something precious and fragile,” “bowl … carried … through the refugee camps”). Motivation—find beauty in the unfinished—drives every beat and crystallizes in the charged final image with bowl pressed to ribs; cost (raw grief endured) is palpable on the page. No contradictory impulses are dramatized at once, so 9-strap is not quite met, but the arc is credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—craftsman’s pride vs. emotional self-infection—plays out in real time through the act of inhaling her own counterfeit. The final exhale is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of denial; the “affectionate detachment” is embodied, not labeled. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ quick test: contradictory impulses in scene + earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s “whimsically attentive” broker mind shows once—spotting the locket symbolism—but her decision to search the library is lightly motivated; the final gift exchange crystallizes a gentle internal shift with cost (she now carries the annotated program), satisfying the 9+ test for a quiet renunciation of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Yara’s contradictory hunger to both give and receive belonging is dramatized in gesture and micro-choice (the reeds in her satchel “like questions she hadn’t learned to ask”). The moment she sees her younger self in the arbor and recognizes her one-sidedness, the epiphany lands with visible cost: she must stay and risk being the one who needs. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only the “luminescent ache” she carries. The only minor drag is a faint therapeutic tinge in “she had never asked to receive,” but it is quickly embodied in the decision to climb back and follow new spirals.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sera’s vocation and inherited duty give her a coherent through-line, but interiority stays summary-level (“she understood now what she must do”) instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment of borrowing time; the emotional cost is asserted rather than embodied, limiting depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is rich and specific—“absence that felt like a word stuck on the tip of her tongue,” “stone that had learned to breathe”—yet the only micro-choice is the final leaving of the eyes; earlier beats are contemplative, not causal. No contradiction is dramatized in scene; the stance tilts only through acceptance-summary rather than enacted renunciation with visible cost. Because the closure is conceptual, the earned cost is mildly attenuated—still credible, but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s “methodical kindness” is embodied in tactile pipe-reading and the tape-reverie; the maternal voice implants a concrete micro-choice—pass the message—whose cost (invisible labor stays invisible) is felt. Interiority stays specific to her sensorial world; no diagnostic labels. The final smile registers earned stasis: she renounces ever being seen, doubling down on unseen custodianship. Only minor withholding: we get no contradictory impulse that might momentarily tempt her toward revelation, so depth stops just short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is botanist-precise yet never clinical: her “slow form of dying” line fuses profession and fear. Contradictory drives—cataloging control versus bodily surrender—coexist inside single beats. The phone call converts observation to confession, but the leaf-handling micro-choices leading up to it feel slightly under-cranked; another tactile beat would push her over the 9-line.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s insomnia is vividly embodied (double vision, trembling hands) and her painter’s eye justifies the synesthetic color-language. The renunciation of the brooch for the telescope crystallizes her shift from clinging to the past to seeking new perspective, with visible cost. Interiority flirts with diagnostic labels (“haggard awe”) but recovers through sensory immediacy. Motive progression is single-note—survival via meaning—yet believable within 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Varen’s arc from omniscient arrogance to humbled listener is cleanly dramatized through the cave’s refusal to reveal futures; the scene where pearls show only his own face is a solid embodied beat. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—but the epiphanic shift is compressed into a single abstract paragraph rather than earned by successive micro-choices, muting cost. The flaw complicates rather than breaks the arc, keeping the score above 8.0 but short of the 9-band where visible contradiction must act in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archivist’s interiority is textured through salt-crusted notebooks and automatic hand-to-satchel checks, grounding his compulsive caretaking. His “reactively visionary” trait activates only in Sera’s presence, compressing decades into one charged beat; the cost is the delayed recognition that the valve’s silence is now his to break. The final micro-choice—closing his hand around the valve—crystallizes his shift from cataloguer to re-activator, paying the price of renewed responsibility. No contradictory impulses play out in scene, so the 9+ gate is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aria’s “analytically artistic” lens is dramatized in every beat—she decodes cracks, weighs geometric against poetic readings, and finally wields the ticket punch on her own silence. The interior contradiction (fear vs certainty) stays embodied, not labeled, and the final spoken truth costs her the protective myth of dispassionate observer.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—precision versus wonder—remains embodied and concrete; the memory cascade is felt, not declared. The renunciation of pure skepticism is earned through tactile contact with the tile and carries visible cost in the final palm-press. No stock phrasing or diagnostic labels mar the peak beat. The shift from observer to co-creator is credible and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elian’s millennia of exhaustion is palpable in embodied gestures—amulet cold against “the永恒 of his skin,” bones humming with the storm—yet the interior contradiction between boredom and unrelenting search stays vivid. The final micro-choice to raise the fragment lands as earned renunciation of endlessness, cost legible in the spatial tearing around him. No secondary character on page keeps relationship crucible dormant; that is within scope. Still, the beat-to-beat motivation is consistent and individuated, held back from 8+ only because the magnitude of the personal cost could be sharpened still further in one on-page sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—her father’s con logic vs her own radical honesty—drives every micro-choice on the page; the moment she decides to “write Darius’s story not as a petition to be judged but as a record to be understood” crystallizes that tension with visible cost (she breaches professional protocol). Embodied emotion is lean but specific: ink scent, the hush of the prep room, the hollowness in Darius’s eyes all filtered through her ledger-trained gaze. The arc lands in credible renunciation: she keeps the night job and the ink, but re-purposes both toward transparency, forfeiting her former neutrality. The only limit to 9-band is that Darius remains a silent witness; relationship pressure is therefore one-sided, so the crucible test is only partially met.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her palm on the lamp, the prism in hand—but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the “earnest studious pursuit” is asserted, never tested against a live alternative. The final stance (keep listening) merely repeats the opening one, so no path is foreclosed with new cost. The character is vivid, yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nameless protagonist’s motive—collecting overheard fragments to reconstruct erased histories—remains consistent and embodied in the tactile handling of the poison label. Interiority is atmospheric rather than deeply contradictory; the “filtering differently” trait is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final decision to keep the label and continue unnamed is credible but costs are stated abstractly (“weight became too heavy”) rather than shown through bodily or relational risk. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s interiority is rich—her “gloomy cheerfulness” is a precise, embodied contradiction that survives the final beat. The cello-visions force on-page micro-choices (“she brushed her fingers across the strings…trembling”) that reveal hierarchy of values: empirical certainty < unspoken regret. Flaw complicity is visible: her professional debunking reflex is what keeps her returning to the strings, tightening the emotional vice. Closure cost is felt: she exits “without a scientific explanation,” a renunciation that forfeits her lifelong identity armor.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—prizing heritage yet choreographing compromise—surfaces in concrete micro-choices (pocketing the chip, chalking each symbol). Embodied tension (stone “grounding her in purpose”) keeps sentiment from sliding into label-speak. The final endurance—continuing to paint dawn messages—accepts cost and forecloses retreat, earned by the prior beat of watching investors parade. Grandmother memory works as credible spur without convenient omniscience; flaw (naïve optimism) remains live.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her “professionally obsessive” lens filters every beat. The grain of sand objectifies her mentor-haunted value hierarchy and seeds the final renunciation. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the emotional turn is reported rather than embodied under pressure, keeping her just shy of 9-band immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s tactile sight is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between loss and heightened perception is dramatized through the water-refraction test. Yet the interiority stays safely in celebratory register—no moment of doubt or cost to his own body/identity is risked, so the “change” is the drone’s, not his. The final smile feels earned but not freighted; we witness competence, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miriam’s vocation and obsession are vivid, but her interiority is mostly summary (“she had learned…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; no micro-choice on the page actually risks anything or forfeits an alternative, so the final “discovery” feels observed, not earned. The only embodied beat—falcon landing—doesn’t force a decision that costs her. Earned Stasis is hinted but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eliorn’s “infinitely patient” trait is more label than dramatized cost; she never falters, doubts, or pays a visible price for her patience, so the arc feels frictionless. The fork-warmth and foot-soreness are the only embodied costs, and they’re generic. Still, her perceptual filter is distinct and consistent, and the final smile carries a credible micro-choice to persist, earning a solid high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward performed awe (“lonesome and splendid all at once”) rather than embodied contradiction; the surrender is moving yet feels predestined, muting micro-choice under pressure. The grandmother’s warning supplies motive, but Marina’s override of survival instinct is asserted, not dramatized in a beat we can test against her panic. Still, the final fusion carries a palpable cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marcus’s filial duty and refusal of silence are vivid, but his inner contradictions stay abstract (“stone in his chest”); no micro-choice on the page actually changes his tactics after entering the cell, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s sorrow-soaked endurance lands as a lived contradiction—ghost who cherishes life, debtor who bestows gifts. The bead-clutch, veil-trail, and chill-bloom causally chain her penance to the gardener’s transformation, so the final release feels earned. One minus: centuries of off-stage penance are summarized rather than dramatized, muting micro-choices that could sharpen present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—trained to mend yet stranded in a waterless world—drives every beat; her body literally sleepwalks while her will sews, an embodied paradox that charges the climax. The grandmother stories and copper plate are not backstory props but causal engines that tilt her present choices. Her final act of stitching the spring’s rim is a renunciation of return and an endurance of perpetual exile, cost paid in the “rare, unexpected beauty of belief fulfilled.” Only the absence of a second on-page figure keeps this from the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is grounded in concrete sensations and micro-choices (clearing debris, clicking the gnomon home); her returnee identity and apple-linked grief are dramatized, not declared. The “warmly curious” stance is shown once, then abandoned for elegiac interiority—no contradiction, but the trait never complicates action. Cost is felt: she forfeits academic distance and accepts stewardship of the orchard, but the decision is quiet; the emotional price registers yet lacks a sharp external consequence on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maren’s quiet, ritualized drive is credibly particularized through micro-choices (flipping the clipboard, chalking the sidewalk, adding the postscript). The interiority stays anchored to sensory work, not abstractions. Cost is present—the dawn departure that will surrender the letter—but because the recipient’s reaction is off-page, the price is still somewhat prospective rather than fully paid; this caps the arc short of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “small smile” and palm-pressed chart show embodied contradiction—but the text never forces her to choose between exposure and safety; the final stitch is still observational, so renunciation cost is only implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s interior contradictions—fierce love vs. cowardice—are embodied in her pocketed shard and micro-choice to press the window; the self-forgiveness lands only after the shard warms and condensation answers, meeting the 9+ test. The 17-year guilt is shown, not diagnosed, and the final stance crystallizes both selves with visible cost (she stays till dawn, letter obsolete). Minor: sister remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is memory-only, capping top band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus compulsive witness-bearing—are alive in every beat. The anesthesia haze lets her body speak a language she must translate, turning her own trauma into work; the moment she touches the cast she’s already breached her own membrane. Her decision to return the cast to the grandmother costs her the last physical trace of the child’s testimony, a renunciation that hurts because we’ve felt her need to hold evidence. Interiority stays concrete: “brain coral fragment cool against her palm” anchors thought in nerve and temperature, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s longing to “rediscover lost joy” is anchored in tactile memory (the fragment, the stumps) and embodied in her trembling hands; the three-year corporate erosion is shown, not told. The moment she laughs “with a pensive edge” crystallizes contradictory impulses—hope and foreknowledge—earning the micro-choice that re-opens her creative risk. No second character exerts crucible pressure, so relationship dynamics stay un-tested, but her interior arc from hollow efficiency to renewed creative courage is fully dramatized and paid for by the fresco’s final darkening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her brushstrokes sync to echo-rhythms, the coin burns in her pocket—but the climactic “conversation” is more asserted than embodied; we’re told she now “completes” the dialogue rather than shown a final, costly micro-choice that seals her renunciation of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s “charming rogue scholar” persona is vividly embodied—coat buttoned wrong, seventeen libraries breached, three interrogations escaped—yet the interior contradiction between performative charm and genuine terror is only asserted, not dramatized in the moment of planting. The final smile registers as earned endurance, but the micro-choice that costs her something right now is missing; hence the arc feels 90 % charged, not fully paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s endurance of centuries of sleepless longing is credibly embodied in the “reef-shadow joy” she distills from waiting; the final image of writing faster as the postcard trembles crystallizes her hierarchy of values—composition over relief. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however, so the interior conflict remains more asserted than enacted. The cost is felt, the voice particular, the renunciation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    The caretaker’s motivation to “preserve names” is legible and constant, but she never makes a micro-choice that risks or costs her anything; the ritual is identical each cycle, so no internal contradiction or escalation is dramatized. The final return of the wind chime merely restates her duty rather than crystallizing a new stance. Earned stasis is hinted at but not charged with visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and musically inflected, but the prose occasionally over-articulates her emotions (“hope rise like a melody”) rather than letting tremor or breath show. The 3-yr estrangement is felt, yet Elian remains an off-page silhouette until the final beat, so the relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred, not dramatized. Micro-choices (uncorking, writing) are present and tied to the promise-keeping motive, earning the cautious smile at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and profession-coded; contradictory impulses (grief vs duty) play out in real time as she samples adhesive and re-measures stone. Micro-choices—coiling the chain, sealing vials—reveal a hierarchy of values with cost (she stays alone in a tremoring arena). Father’s absence motivates every beat, but her final decision to continue his channels feels slightly abstract; we’re told rather than shown the concrete risk she now accepts. Voice stays consistent, never slides into diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete, specific, and embodied—“perfume that Eleanor had grown to need” shows addiction to grief without naming it. Her micro-choices (mapping dust motes, pressing transducer to stone) externalize the internal contradiction between scientific control and emotional surrender. The final renunciation—choosing to keep sending messages into silence—pays off the established flaw of distrust after the aviary silence, costing her the comfort of certainty. No diagnostic label-speak; body and action carry the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her shift from passive drift to deliberate crossing is embodied in palm-on-wood micro-choices. The “featherly determined” trait remains label-only until the final step; a single wobble under pressure would have pushed this to 9. Cost is felt in the lost intuitive tether to her mother, but the renunciation is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek’s inherited quest is legible and his patient observant nature stays consistent, but the interiority leans on abstract heritage (“rhythm of belonging”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final beat of shared wonder is moving yet feels bequeathed rather than earned through visible micro-choice. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is textured—her “cheerful gloom,” her willingness to hold ambiguity—yet the story never forces her to test that stance under duress; she observes, translates, then delivers comfort without a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The fisher’s grief is palpable in gesture (trembling pouch, free tears), but he remains a passive recipient, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent. The final beat lands as empathetic report, not personal renunciation; closure accrues to the fisher, not the protagonist, so Maren’s arc plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    A single, consistent mind is rendered with tactile precision—his counting pulse, the bishop’s grooves, the micro-choice to toss rather than catch. Interior contradiction is absent; he never risks failure or questions the worth of “serenading monotony,” so the arc is flat. The final smile is analytic, not costly; we exit inside the same loop we entered.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “architecture of her bones” and “salt of her former world” poeticize memory without embodying contradiction. The renunciation lands as a serene given rather than a choice fought in scene; no micro-choice shows cost before the shoulder-touch. The mortal woman remains a silent canvas, so relationship pressure is absent. Still, the dancer’s alien sensorium and the final lightness sell a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glazier’s interiority is textured—her “patience for the slow mathematics of water” feels particular—but she never makes a choice that costs her anything. The stone-throw is ritual, not decision; the day ahead is “small problems,” never sharpened into a stakes-bearing test. Without a micro-choice that forecloses a path, motivation stays observational, not dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—climb toward memory yet shoulder others’ grief—are embodied in the scar-tracing, box-handling micro-choices; the final vow to “translate pain” is earned by seven years of fireground drills and the mirror-drop. Interiority stays concrete (“landscape of her survival,” “hard softness”) without therapy-speak. The only minor slack: Elena remains off-stage, so the relationship crucible is implied, not pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent—logical dreamer who treats hope as measurable—but she never makes a choice that costs her anything; the story ends still “preparing for another session,” so no endurance/renunciation is earned. Micro-choices (fold, release, track) are present yet repetitive and low-stakes, flattening hierarchy of values. The grandfather’s gauge is mentioned but never handled or risked, so object-based character revelation is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s inherited calling and her solitary vigil in the drowned university are rendered with tactile interiority; the moment she kneels to lift the scorched diaries, curiosity and obligation lock into one embodied motion. The final sketching in the dark crystallizes a credible endurance that costs her solitude yet feels earned by the preceding attention to Ashworth’s echo. Minor: the “acute sensitivity” label is stated once before it is dramatized, but the body-quick reactions that follow override the lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aria’s calm, centuries-long patience and the borrowed heartbeat that tethers her to mortality are viscerally embodied; the image of her “silver eyes” and “light, almost floating” gait crystallizes a being who has never hurried. Her interior contradiction—immortal yet heartbeat-dependent—surfaces in the micro-choice to sing rather than seize, letting dawn “coax shadows” as she persuades mirrors. The final renunciation (she leaves without claiming any vision for herself) costs her the chance to stay and see the futures she’s seeded, a visible forfeiture scaled to the story’s lyric scope. Voice remains singular, never lapsing into label-speak; even the abstract “possibility” is grounded in the physical act of song.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to grief while weaponizing it as methodology—are dramatized in the handshake beat; the micro-choice to read the dead aloud instead of proposing terms crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete (“geometry of a loss”) and avoids label-speak. The earned renunciation—peace as saving the living, not honoring the dead—carries visible cost in the confession beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight external safety-hedge (no refusal or failure tested on-page) keeps her just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—clinical resolve vs. sentimental ache—are dramatized in the trembling gloved hand and the refusal to look back. Sacrifice is embodied, not labeled: the map-cracks she counts are the same fissures she has carved into her own life. The final renunciation (walking away) carries visible cost: “everything that once mattered” is itemized and forfeited. Only the late, single-sentence label “simply driven” nicks the skin; it is abstract after such granular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The courtesan’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “refusal” encoded in wrist-turns, her gaze carrying “entire conversations”—and her quiet endurance earns a credible Cost: she forecloses the palace’s lullaby forever. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed, but the character-specific poetry of gesture and the final crystallized defiance keep her well inside the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical but stays cerebral; the reverse-telling choice externalizes no contradictory micro-beat on the page, so the “earned” shift feels announced rather than dramatized. Serenity trait is asserted, not tested under pressure—no bodily cost or visible mistake complicates it. Still, the single-POV arc is coherent and the final renunciation carries a felt price, meeting the 600-word baseline for credible change.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s vocation and temperament are vivid; her micro-choices (knotting rescue lattice, timing the seventeen-minute rest) embody the “esoteric realist” label. Interior contradiction is light—she wavers only in the shift from preservation to interruption—so the arc feels more competent than crucible-tested. Still, the renunciation of monument-building for fragile shelter is earned and costs her three days’ labor, satisfying the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Yara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to resume her craft—are dramatized in the tactile re-braiding beats; the final renunciation of exile costs her the last warmth of isolation and is earned by the five-winter reflection braided into the present action. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The “technically gentle” trait directly enables the rope surgery and carries the risk of snapping the fragile fiber, so flaw and gift collide. One hairline slip: “forgiveness had come at last” is slightly abstract, but the next sentence immediately forges it into the physical act, so the arc retains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is character-specific—dream-pressed cartography, pulse-listening—but the final “transcend” is an unearned leap; no micro-choice or contradiction is dramatized on the page, so the cost feels asserted, not embodied. Still, her embodied attention to the seal and bunker wall keeps her above stock mystic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maruk’s interiority is concrete—his “grim satisfaction in how little oil such work consumed” crystallizes frugality under pressure. The single contradiction—empirical habit versus willingness to risk speech to the unknown—drives the final beat. Cost is visible: he stays silent at dawn, renouncing explanation, a foreclosed path that stings. No stock phrasing; the flaw is the slight off-page feel to the covenant renewal (more reported than embodied), keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal to force Kael, and her “scheme” is the gentle act of offering the box; the memory-pin moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Kael’s resentment is palpable in flickering embodiment and whispered accusation, and his release feels earned because the text has kept the grudge alive in every beat. Interiority is specific: “cells remember joy” lands as lived sensation. The only drag is a trace of therapist cadence in “resentment is a cage,” but the final hand-wrap micro-choice overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is evocative—her certainty of foot and purpose—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the “synchronized breathing” choice is reported, not dramatized, so the final endurance feels pre-ordained rather than paid for. No visible cost or micro-choice alters her hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s stubborn pride and need for repair are palpable, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnostic labels (“she understood… that some promises could not be mended with tools alone”) that tell us the epiphany rather than dramatize it. The embodied emotion is strong early (ribbon in pocket, knees aching) yet the final beat summarizes the change instead of letting contradiction play out in gesture. The cost is felt—daughter’s stopped reach, the re-tied ribbon—but the turn is slightly over-articulated for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete, character-specific, and embodied (e.g., “brightened disquiet that tingled along her spine”). Her contradictory mix of custodial duty and bewilderment drives every beat; the micro-choice to whisper the forbidden question earns the final image and carries visible cost—she can no longer remain merely bewildered. No stock phrasing or therapy-speak appears; competence is balanced with genuine struggle. The only hairline slip is a slight over-articulation of inheritance mechanics in paragraph 4, but it never flattens emotion or motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—pressing the diary “like a protective amulet” embodies her stake—but she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The diary translation work is summarized, not dramatized, so we don’t see contradictory impulses collide under pressure. Closure feels like acceptance rather than earned renunciation; the “single crystalline note” lands as mood, not paid-for stance. Competence is asserted (“decades learning”) without struggle on the page, blinding us to genuine limits.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—needing her brother yet resenting the “curse”—is vivid, but no embodied micro-choice under pressure shows this warping her actions. The emerald card stays a passive talisman; she never has to risk or renounce it, so the final beat feels observed, not earned. “Blissful aberration” is asserted, never dramatized as a limit that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s “warmly methodical” patience is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing the seal, steadying the ladder—yet the interiority drifts into thesis-statement cadence (“absence could be as eloquent as presence”) that flattens contradictory emotion. The final smile feels more author-label than embodied cost; we see no tremor or breath that lets us feel the price of stepping through an impossible door.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—the ripple-mark skin, the stone against her ribs—yet the climactic “invitation” of the bloom is slightly too serene; a sharper cost (pain, vertigo, forfeiture of sight?) would have sealed the arc. Still, her decades-trained sensitivity and the bodily payoff give a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s custodian identity and retrocognitive gift are vivid, but interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“as if the universe had whispered”) that flattens contradiction. No second character appears, so status crucible is moot; her sole micro-choice—climb at midnight—feels inevitable rather than costly. The prism momentarily embodies ancestral hands, yet the beat is summary, not sensed action. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized: we are told she “understood finally” without seeing the path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Archivist’s interiority is evocative but stays observational; no micro-choice alters her path or costs her anything. The final “recording” is abstract—no quill touches stone, no risk taken—so identity shift feels asserted, not earned. Pre-emptive nostalgia remains a label; it never complicates a decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her knees on cold stone, the weight of the satchel, the spiral burn she trusts. Contradictory impulses (fear of wasting her last rag vs need to reignite the sky) are held simultaneously in the moment she ties the knot. The final act is earned: she spends her grandmother’s heirloom spark and the village’s last silence, a visible forfeiture. Only the lineage epiphany (“I am a keeper…”) feels a hair over-articulated, trimming the top decimal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s chronicler identity is concrete—she tastes the jade cicada, links tide data to emotional stakes, and her final micro-choice (placing the charm between them) re-configures the sister stasis. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic; the “warmly observant” trait shows in how she tracks water rhythm while avoiding eye contact. Flaw: the sister remains a silhouette; no contradictory impulse from her is legible, so the relationship crucible is half-forged. Still, Mira’s earned refusal-to-retreat carries visible cost in the image of warmed stone cooling between them.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for open sky vs ingrained bunker fear—are dramatized in her micro-choice to place the doll on the railing beside the impossible sprout; the final resolve to “build something different” carries visible cost as she accepts returning to the bunker tonight. Interiority stays embodied (“second skin too tight and too loose”) and avoids label-speak. The porcelain doll’s pulse against her heart supplies an externalized beat of change that justifies the Earned Stasis. One hairline slip: “breathing in both directions at once” drifts toward abstraction at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—detached logic vs. intuitive caretaking—drives every micro-choice; the storm-glass color shifts externalize her internal gauge without diagnostic label-speak. The single on-page passenger (the boy) becomes the crucible: her decision to extend the route, uncork the vial, and hum at train-whistle frequency all flow from the same trait hierarchy. The cost is quietly paid: she forfeits schedule and takes emotional occupancy of the child’s nightmare, a renunciation legible in the crystalline clarity of the glass at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority stays scholarly and calm, matching a lifelong lore-keeper, but the text never lets us feel a contradictory impulse—only serene certainty—so the final “I am a candidate” lands pre-decided rather than wrestled. Ruby warmth and mural recognition stand in for embodied crisis; no bodily fear or hesitation disturbs her pulse. Still, the lifelong study motive is steady and the renunciation of ordinary scholarship for guardianship is legible at cost of leaving the orchard behind.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s interior contradiction—needing isolation yet suffocating inside it—is embodied in her handling of the ring and the final step outward; the micro-choice to open the door is earned. However, the “former self” apparition functions more as thematic mirror than second character, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the arc is largely monologue. Still, the renunciation of absolute withdrawal carries visible cost as the sanctuary walls crumble. Voice stays coherent, though a few abstract labels (“slow suffocation”) slightly dilute embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s distrust of promises is anchored in a single past wound; it drives every micro-choice (answering the text, clutching the bolt, stepping inside). The mirrored-self beat externalizes her interior contradiction without therapy-speak and forces her to witness her own survival cost; the tear-streaked acceptance is causally earned. Flaw: “virtuously mischievous” is asserted twice but never allowed to complicate a decision on the page, so the trait stays label-level.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is textured (“the creak… sounded like a greeting from a dying world”) and anchors Elara’s estrangement. The final readiness to turn the crank is credibly prepared by childhood memory and lawyerly necessity. Yet the decisive cost—accepting dynastic identity—remains more asserted than embodied; no bodily or external price is shown once the voice speaks, so the beat lands slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aldric’s guilt-shut interiority is vivid (the vow slips out “without conscious intention”), but his metamorphosis from mute grief to “shivering bliss” is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory impulse complicates the pivot, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—preserve vs. decide—grounds every beat; the button discovery crystallizes her renunciation of judgment in favor of witness. Emotion is embodied in tactile handling of archives, not labels. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Micro-choice to document the button with “reverence that bordered on prayer” earns stasis at visible cost: she accepts lifelong secondary agency. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—obedient archivist vs. clandestine savior—remains sharp throughout; every micro-choice (slipping into the service entrance, deciding to wade the lagoon) is filtered through the same “quiet, careful” identity. The key’s fit in the hidden lock crystallizes a lifetime of inherited resourcefulness; the cost of exposure is felt in the moment the stone begins to grate. No other characters on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Eleven-year invisibility is credibly strained, not abandoned, by the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    One-man show; interiority is lyrical but never slips into self-diagnosis.  The inherited duty supplies credible motive and the daily renunciation lands as earned stasis—“he had bought them another day” pays the cost.  No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the stakes rise but the inner split stays off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphina’s patient, stone-and-water precision is vividly shown through her seed-sorting ritual; her drive to decode leaves feels lived-in. The “tingle at the base of her skull” nicely externalizes transformation, but the internal stakes of that metamorphosis stay abstract—no concrete flaw or contradiction complicates her path. The final shift to “web of connections” is announced more than dramatized, so the cost of transformation is conceptually legible yet emotionally diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maren’s grief and “uncertainly certain” trait generate clear motive; the irony of fixer of dead clocks vs. her frozen personal clock is vivid. Still, she only observes, walks, descends—no on-page choice that changes anything; agency is deferred to whatever she finds below. Closure is pending, so no earned cost yet. Characterization stout but incomplete until she acts.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s guilt-driven need to resurrect her brother’s obsession is embodied in every micro-choice (touching the coin, lighting the forge, pouring the gold). The kintsugi decision crystallizes her shift from cautious academic to risk-taking inheritor, and the final lift of the glowing coin is earned. Interiority stays concrete—rainwater in brass pans, forge heat on her wrists—never sliding into label-speak. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s exhaustion-born fearlessness is shown through ritual micro-moves—harp case hugged “like a secret,” deliberate tooth-press to string—each choice externalizing her marrow-deep motive. The soldier’s flicker-smile is earned because Mira first excavates his pre-war humanity (milk-out-the-nose memory) and then risks discordant sound that could fail. Interiority stays concrete: “familiar ache in her chest that never quite healed” bodies her cost. Only minor shortfall: no live contradiction tested in this beat; attribute is confirmed, not complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s shame-riven interiority is vivid and embodied; “body remembering” supplies micro-choices with cost. The final stance—refusing to unclip the beacon-strap—crystallizes an earned stasis that forecloses comfort, though her overt contradictory impulse in-scene could be sharper still.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and consistent with the “reader of the in-between” idiom; the lens fragment functions as a concrete micro-choice engine. Yet the grandmother’s deathbed hand-off is relayed rather than dramatized, so the emotional cost is inherited, not freshly earned on page. Still, the final act of wearing the relay visibly crystallizes the inherited flaw into vocation, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s observant gaze and elevator-mechanic mindset drive every beat; the mainspring barrel as talisman objectifies his need to “read” abandoned places. Interiority stays concrete—never drifts into label-speak—and the final micro-choice to reach for the hatch crystallizes values. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Closure cost is present but comparatively quiet; hence shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s tactile intimacy with the press and her amber-pause backstory give her a sharp, idiosyncratic core, but the story keeps her interiority at a reverent distance; we watch her “feel” and “remember” rather than wrestle contradictory impulses in scene. The final micro-choice—setting the type to print the released whisper—lands as a gentle continuation of habit, not a charged renunciation or risk, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personal. She is vivid, but not yet put under relationship pressure or forced to pay a price that would make her unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vespera’s haunted caretaker persona is visceral; the shard-in-pocket ritual and mirror-work embody her “polished stone” arc. Interior contradiction—revolutionary fire vs archival custodian—plays out in micro-choices (covering mirrors while yearning to look). The earned renunciation at the end costs her the comfort of a single origin myth, visible in the final mirror-covering beat. Flaw: no second on-page character, so status crucible and dialogue bullets stay NA; still, single-POV depth meets 9- gate with embodied emotion under storm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cassian’s caretaker-mentality is consistent, but interiority leans on abstract summary (“weight of every note…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choice at the tether beat is present yet emotionally muted—his smile registers but no opposing impulse is dramatized. Earned stasis is credible (lifetime spent), yet cost feels diffuse because the covenant’s personal price is told, not freshly tasted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation and gift are concretely anchored in micro-choices—walking the factory floor, uncorking the vial, choosing not to sell—and her final renunciation at the lagoon is earned by this quiet, consistent pattern. Her “sensible eccentricity” is shown through sensory stillness rather than label, and the psychic cost of abandoning her trade is felt in the last empty vial. Interiority stays character-specific, never sliding into therapy-speak. Only the absence of an explicit contradictory impulse in-scene keeps this just outside the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aria’s tactile relationship to wood and salt is vivid and specific; the lantern-slide reveal forces a credible re-prioritization of her life’s work. Interiority stays concrete (“each curve an invitation”) and the final renunciation—carving the single reaching arm—carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only a smooth ascent to insight, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “quiet laugh” in the pavilion crystallizes the earned shift from obsession to reverence—but the micro-choice that seals her arc (picking up the brush) is only implicit, softening the cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; the revelation happens to her rather than forcing a visible forfeiture. Still, the artist-through-perception construct is specific and avoids diagnostic self-talk, satisfying the 9− quick test for single-POV.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Miriam’s grief-wonder mix is evoked more than embodied; “searing mixture of grief and wonder” is label-speak at the emotional peak. Her single on-page micro-choice—kneeling to trace the cipher—feels lightweight against thirty years of yearning; the apparition does the narrative work, not her. No contradictory impulse is staged in real time, so the beat reads as revelation rather than decision. Closure is vicarious witnessing, not an earned renunciation or act that costs her a path.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s refusal of false comfort and his deliberate stewardship of memory are dramatized through the embodied, painful pouring-in of recollections; the final smile is earned because every preceding beat shows him paying the cost of solitude and renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—flour-and-water hands, loom-twitching fingers—avoiding label-speak. The only limit is that the townspeople-cum-memory constructs remain emblematic rather than individuated, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Seraphine’s interior contradiction—relishing silence yet yearning to refill it—peaks when she literally presses memory to skin; embodied cost (temple pressure) is subtle but present. Micro-choice lineage is clear: climb, settle, press, remain. Earned renunciation of ordinary sound-archive work for a covenant with the dead satisfies 9+ test, though emotional palette stays within “velvet disquiet” without deeper body shock.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is crystalline and embodied—“frost-numbed palm” against acorn ridges, heat pooling in chest while mercury drops—demonstrating the required contradictory stillness. The micro-choice to open herself as a conduit for seven generations is dramatized, not declared, and the final serene/wild smile is earned by prior causality. Yet the absence of any second on-page character limits crucible pressure, and the “texture of borrowed time” is still slightly label-adjacent; a touch more sensory paradox would have nudged this into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s “humble storm siren tester” role is vivid in tactile ritual, but her interiority drifts into scenic meditation; contradictory impulses stay observational, never forcing a micro-choice that alters tactics. The climax is pure competent execution—no visible cost or stance shift—so the arc feels like a successful calibration rather than a lived transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush, consistent, and embodied; the janitor’s spiritually-curious stance drives every micro-gesture. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—only serene continuity—so the character never risks a wrong move or cost. Still, the quiet arc of “witness → cradle → release” is credible and specific to this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is atmospheric—“tranquilly perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized—but her micro-choices (sitting, rising, digging, cradling) do track a coherent arc from observer to keeper, and the final lap-weight of the box lands a cost. The absence of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps her just short of the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is rich—“holding became the pause itself” is a character-specific epiphany—but the only micro-choice on-page is listing another advert; no contradictory impulse or embodied cost appears. Motivation is declared, not dramatised under pressure; hence the arc feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.3)
    The poet’s interiority is textured through concrete, body-level noticing—“hands moved warmly attentive,” “small fire that needed no fuel but its own incompleteness”—and every micro-choice (pocketing the feather, winding paper to kite) externalizes the thematic want. Contradictory impulses (to mend vs. to accept fracture) are held live in scene, and the final renunciation—letting the bird fly without the kite—pays the cost of that tension. No diagnostic label-speak; even the abstract “beauty of the unfinished” is arrived at through tactile sequence. Voice remains singular, flaw present in the poet’s need to control repair, and that flaw is not cured but embraced, earning quiet stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on the wire, the ladder’s rung, the diary’s worn leather—but the diagnosis never complicates her calm; no contradictory impulse disturbs the single note of acceptance, so the “earned cost” gate stays half-open. The copper-wrap micro-choices visibly enact her value hierarchy, yet the scene lacks a final fork where renunciation or risk could crystallize cost. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, lifting the profile into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elena’s skeptical-scientist lens is credibly particular—her noticing centers on “chemistry of homecoming,” amber optics, alien migration data—yet interiority drifts into essayistic summary (“She wondered if…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The only embodied beat is lifting the fossil; otherwise emotion is named, not felt. No micro-choice visibly forecloses her academic future on the page; cost is asserted in retrospect. Renunciation therefore reads intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    The coachman’s motives—language-keeper, seed-bearer, ferryman of ends—cohere in the single gesture of planting a pod; the smile at “first green thread” shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete via reef-rib touch and gull-cry translation; no label-speak. Yet the arc is renunciation-to-hope rather than contradiction-in-scene; the only inner friction is memory vs future, told more than tested under live pressure. Still, the endurance forecloses despair and is legible, satisfying the earned-stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s sensory gift and quiet obsession are persuasively embodied; the autumn leaf and cylinder function as extensions of motive rather than decoration. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where bloodhound acuity fails him—so the flaw-to-struggle ratio feels thin. The final endurance (“holding…voice”) is credible renunciation, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is thick and embodied—her palm on vibrating glass, the compass rose pulsing against her chest. Contradictory impulses (guilt, wonder, duty) coexist in real time rather than alternating. The final micro-choice—sketching the sky “not as it was but as it might be”—pays the accumulated cost of her pariah status and is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    Caelius’s guilt is vivid, but the text tells us he is a “chivalrous thief” rather than letting a current steal dramatize the code; his final relief is stated, not embodied. Seraph’s wonder is asserted twice without on-page contradiction or cost. No micro-choice on the deck shows his ethics in tension with the moment, so the apology feels pre-decided.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—archivist vs. renouncer—are alive in the final footstep pattern; the cost of letting the sister’s name go is embodied in the empty chessboard she leaves behind. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The “benevolently ruthless” trait shows up once, in the triage memory, and is never tested again, so the arc feels slightly under-combed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is present but stays summary-level (“buried talent… garden to be cultivated”); no embodied micro-choice under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (“she would leave… carry them”), satisfying the 9+ test structurally, yet the beat itself is narrated, not dramatized, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s exiled-chess-tutor identity is sharply embodied: her fingers “winnow” the tapestry the way they once probed pieces, and the border she decodes is literally her own scandal rewoven. The interior contradiction—guilt vs. conviction that the sacrifice was teachable—drives every micro-choice, and the final stilling of her hands shows earned renunciation with cost. The only flaw: the “fierce repose” tone is named more than dramatized in body language, so the hierarchy of values feels slightly abstract at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sera’s defiance is embodied in every charcoal stroke and whispered poem; the interior contradiction—yearning to belong yet sabotaging the ritual—drives every beat. The children’s hunger mirrors her own, creating crucible pressure that forces her stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: the ritual can no longer claim her truths, and her earlier surrender is irrevocably forfeit. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “price of forgiveness” that momentarily flattens embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to uncertainty while performing a ritual of meaning—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (pressing charm to statue, matching scars). Her arc lands as credible renunciation: she accepts permanent uncertainty as illumination, paying with the literal breath she holds while the sea waits. The final smile crystallizes Earned Stasis; no higher band because interiority occasionally drifts into lightly abstract self-diagnosis (“uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic”).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s grief-numbed stasis is embodied in the cave walks; the returning itch in his fingers offers a credible micro-shift. Interiority is mostly concrete (“illusion of surrender,” “cathedral walls”) but drifts into abstract summary (“temporary eternity he had spent his life constructing”). The renunciation—placing the painted shell into the pool—carries visible cost and reconciles his promise. No contradictory impulses play out in-scene, so the beat falls short of 8-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—salt-granite under palm, jasmine cutting ego—and her renunciation of prayer for “a vibration that had no name” is a micro-choice that visibly costs her old certainties. The causal chain from vial → scent → lens → ship is clean, but the “screaming tenderness” line drifts into label-speak at the exact climax, softening the embodied contradiction needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s grief-tuned compass is vivid: moon-phase mood, bronze anchor in pocket, reflexive “I’m coming to meet you.” Interiority stays concrete, but the lone on-page decision—walking out to co-navigate—feels slightly under-pressured; the woman’s tear-stained face does the emotional lifting. Still, the cost of re-entering others’ grief is palpable and inherited object/hand-touch continuity satisfies earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s grief-driven compulsion is vivid, but the “involuntarily truthful” trait is declared not dramatized—no on-page moment where it costs her. The hollow choice is credible renunciation, yet interiority leans on abstractions (“some memories too precious to let die”) rather than embodied contradiction. Emotional stakes feel high; micro-choices (climb, hide, study) align, but the climax lacks a visible price tied to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aldric’s contradictory pull between guarded solitude and ache for connection is rendered through tactile micro-gestures (thumb worrying wax paper, lifting the flower to light) that externalize interior pressure. The final decision to write is credibly foreshadowed by the remembered childhood abandonment, so the renunciation of isolation costs something we have watched him nurse for nineteen years. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority alone drives the arc and meets the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and character-bound (“the paper remembered, and so did she”). Her intuitive expertise is embodied in the tactile heat of the matrix chip and the choice to step through the door with “calm recognition,” a visible cost. The thirty-year backstory is efficiently anchored to present objects and decisions. Only the father’s promise is relayed second-hand, keeping full 9+ just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward performed melancholy (“wonder crept back into her bones”) rather than embodied contradiction. The climb itself supplies micro-choices, yet her decisive shift—accepting guardianship of the wounded sky—feels abrupt because no prior beat shows her resisting that responsibility; the cost is named but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maren’s shift from distillation to “letting presence remain alive” is legible and tied to the shell’s tactile reprise, but the interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized; micro-choices under pressure are limited to pressing the shell to her cheek—earned, but thinly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler’s voice pulses with interior contradiction—driven to impose order yet addicted to the very dissolution of time. His jealousy of the self at the pine table crystallizes a credible split inside a single psyche, not just a narrative trick. The “feral nostalgia” is not merely named; it claws through every beat, warping his perceptions and actions. Only the lack of an external relationship crucible keeps this from topping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her synesthetic memory of scent carries the loss. The micro-choice to pick up the screw and keep it warm literalizes her shift from mourning to attention. No contradiction under pressure; the arc is credible renunciation, though Mira stays functional rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and body-bound; the crystallizing trait literalizes grief under pressure and drives the final gesture. The shift from scholarly denial to ancestral belief is earned through tactile memory and the grandmother’s quill. Micro-choices—pressing the quill, letting the heart dictate the stroke—carry visible cost as blood-ink meets rain. Only the scar-backstory feels briefly external, not fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s fear-of-failure silence is embodied in the throat-tangle of “loosened strings,” and the apology is a credible renunciation that costs her the last seconds of contact; the six-year avoidance is stated rather than dramatized, so the interior contradiction feels slightly second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara is only a scenic filter; she never makes a choice, suffers cost, or changes stance—she merely “moves,” “approaches,” and “begins” without completing anything. Interiority is abstract (“consciousness expanding”) rather than embodied contradiction. The promised “end of history witness” role stays ornamental; no tension arises between observer duty and personal desire. No closure anchor exists because no path is closed or paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aira’s seventeen-year devotion is palpable, but the piece never lets us see her make a risky choice; she winds, observes, smiles—endurance without a fork. Interiority is lyrically textured yet loops on the same insight (“clocks measure change itself”) rather than revealing new contradiction under tonight’s “razor” conditions. The promised peculiarity never complicates action or costs her anything on-page, so the arc lands as serene stasis, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection while enforcing distance—are dramatized in every micro-choice: her stillness at the man’s approach, the refusal to cross the invisible membrane, the silent counting of years. The final line she allows herself (“You’re leaving”) is earned by three years of suspended speech; its crack carries the full cost of intimacy maintained through omission. Interiority is concrete and fungus-filtered, never diagnostic; the “physics of letting go” is lived, not explained. The closing triangle of familiar strangers achieves Charged Poise: a stance crystallized, paths foreclosed, cost felt in the breath they do not share.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is rich and specific—her father’s card-counting under sodium lights lands as embodied memory—but the present-scene micro-choices are thin; she boards, walks, sits, speaks once. The hospital moment pivots on a single declarative sentence (“They’re invitations…”) without on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse, so the final stance feels announced rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her ear for the tunnel’s “breathing” and the glass harmonica’s impossible light—but she never makes a visible choice under pressure; the arc is purely observational. The “cultivated estrangement” is declared, not dramatized in a beat that costs her anything. No contradictory impulse surfaces in scene; the job tenure (11 years) is backstory, not stakes-tested. Closure is a poised wait, not an earned renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interior contradiction is rich—fear of proximity vs. need to examine—but no embodied micro-choice alters tactics; the photo kiss is gesture, not stakes-moving decision. Emotional layering is evocative yet static; cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Meets Q1 quick test partly: impulses coexist in scene, but final promise lacks visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured (“desperately jocular” under duress), the midnight promise is a credible renunciation with social cost, and the logistician’s flaw—evasion of intimacy—drives the closing choice. Micro-choices (offering the recipe chain, accepting the stay) align with motive; only the woman remains a thematic mirror rather than a pressure source, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is richly embodied—grief “translated” through skin, bark read as Braille—yet the decisive shift from seeker to carrier-of-stillness is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly seals the renunciation, so the cost feels lightly assigned rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—her ritual with the pen, her comfort with doubt, her tactile tracing of contingent echoes—and the final recognition is earned by the patient attention we’ve watched. The “confidently uncertain” trait is more than label: it governs her non-standard method and the cost of remaining at this outpost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed, but motivation stays consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—clinging to her grandmother’s camera while learning the necessity of leaving images unrecorded—are dramatized in the final harbor dance; the cost is felt as she accepts the camera will stay empty. Interiority is concrete, body-based, never label-heavy. Elena’s silent arrival tightens the crucible; their shared grief alters mutual status without exposition. Only the “quietly charismatic” tag is asserted, not earned on-page, keeping the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s arsonist origin and off-grid life read as backstory labels; the Archive years are summarized, not dramatized. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; the final “promise fulfilled” is declared, not cost-earned. Interiority defaults to abstract “analytically intuitive” tellings rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—submission to experiment versus covert reclamation of agency—remains vivid and embodied; the childhood drum-code micro-choice on the stone platform crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The link between her endurance and Mira’s dream is emotionally specific, but the cost (continued subjection to vomiting sessions) is asserted rather than shown in the final beat, keeping the renunciation just shy of irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s embodied knowledge of the labyrinth and the coin-as-intention weight give a lived-in interiority; her ‘whispers’ creed is dramatized through two on-page micro-choices (sending workers, facing Reyes). Yet the interior contradiction expected for 9+ never surfaces—no moment where her creed costs her personally or where she doubts it. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the cost is communal, not intimate; the personal stake plateaus rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s nineteen-year silence is embodied through micro-choices—mirror angling, silent sitting, light-weaving—so her stillness is active, not abstract. The moment she meets the boy’s gaze, the inherited-survivor identity crystallizes with felt cost: she can never speak her own rescue aloud. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the boy’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized, so the relationship crucible is one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is lyrically specific—“cultivated patience the way other people breathed”—and her refusal to grandstand feels credible. Yet every beat is summary: no single embodied choice under pressure dramatizes her revolution or costs her anything on-page. The promised “dangerous revolutionary” never risks reputation, job, or safety; the arc is pure projection. Without a dramatized fork or sacrifice, motivation stays conceptual, not operative.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s guarded-to-open arc is credibly embodied: the trembling unclasping of the scrimshaw, the deliberate laying-down, the cold-water step all manifest contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority stays concrete (“armor she had built around her heart” vs. “flower in the deep”) without diagnostic speak. The final renunciation is foreshadowed by her father’s earlier words and micro-choices under rising whale-call pressure; cost is felt as she swims away from the dock-lights that defined her. One hairline slip: “graceful Maren, careful Maren, guarded Maren” risks label-stack, but rhythm justifies it as incantatory release.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her theatrical cadence, her self-loathing, her performative narration to fool the drones all read as individuated. Moral ambiguity is not just claimed but dramatized: she admits she “does not deserve to grieve” yet keeps carving memorials, a contradiction that charges every whittling beat. The final stance—blank-faced defiance—pays off the lifetime of performed neutrality, earning her Earned Stasis with visible cost (she forecloses both joy and sorrow). Secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucible is N/A; the score reflects single-POV depth only.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract—tremor of certainty, aesthetically driven heart—never grounded in concrete bodily contradiction; no micro-choice is charged under pressure, only soft recitations. The “decision” to walk through is pre-given by the ban-lift, so no visible cost or flaw complicates the crossing; she ends exalted with no earned friction. Character remains atmospheric rather than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—her need to pass the reed-tongue gift forward while guarding her color-blind sight—shows in embodied micro-choices (placing the petal beside his burned hand). The apprentice’s want-to-see is dramatized through silent deciphering, not label-speak. Cost is legible: she permanently yields her talisman, he kneels into a new vocation. Yet the “innocently cunning” trait is stated once and never tested under pressure; the glassblower stays a scenic backdrop, supplying no secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her habit of holding the lens to her ear, the “texture of connection” obsession—but no contradictory impulse ever collides with it; every micro-choice merely confirms her monolithic intent. The final stance is a restatement, not a renunciation or costly crystallization, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—grief threaded into craft, centuries of practice felt in gesture—but the arrival of the flickering woman compresses the relationship crucible into a single offer pendant. The micro-choice to “come” is credible, yet the woman’s opaque translucency blurs status dynamics and stakes. Teacher’s crystalline backstory is lyrically anchored, but the new arrival’s motive stays atmospheric rather than embodied. Still, the grief-work vocation is specific and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s inherited cartomancer role is lived-in—her micro-choice to hand Soren the tape and read his twelve-foot pull crystallizes her worldview. Soren’s tremor and confession feel earned, but we are told his hollow eyes rather than shown a corporeal tic that would reveal the fracture beneath the analyst skin. Interior contradiction is present yet thin: Maren “always knows” yet never doubts aloud, so the cost of her certainty never lands on her body. The closure grants Soren hope but not a visible renunciation or new risk, so the emotional ledger stays tipped toward him alone.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"anguished joy rise in my chest"—but the narrator’s contradictory impulses (scholarly possession vs. surrender) are asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choice; the final surrender is foreshadowed yet feels pre-decided, trimming cost. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” identity is evoked more than enacted; she watches, compares, and archives, yet the only micro-choice on the page—continuing to watch the child/mother footage—repeats rather than escalates. Interiority is vivid (“luminous regret”) but stays summary-level; no contradictory impulse collides with her drive to preserve hope, so renunciation reads predetermined. The embodied cost (stone warming) is present but abstract; without a live beat where she almost deletes or saves a frame, motivation stays atmospheric, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tremor against steady hands, the felt weight of the tail tip—and her micro-choice to reconstruct rather than discard anchors the arc. The contradiction between her past credulity and present clarity plays out in the tactile act, not summary. Cost is visible: the reconstructed tail will always show seams, mirroring her own. The “quietly vivid” trait is shown through sensory attention, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—cold stone on palm, scarred hands against plaster—and her contradictory impulses (guilt vs. need to remember) play out in concrete micro-choices like crawling into the tunnel and pressing her prints to his. The final beat of earned stasis—accepting the scars as love, not shame—pays off the telepathic ivy cue and coffee-ring backstory. A hairline slip: the moment she “realizes it was an accident” is declared rather than dramatized, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is richly concrete—her psychometric gift is shown through tactile, synesthetic beats (“hum of unused love vibrating”). One contradiction is staged: she arrives to “find” yet ends by renouncing extraction, the cost legible in her quiet exit. The lone flaw: the renunciation is voiced in abstract editorial (“some stories…only witnessed”) rather than dramatized micro-choice; still, the embodied tears and the final stair-descent supply enough visible price to satisfy earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seraphine’s desperation and eventual surrender are embodied in concrete micro-moments (pressing brass teeth into palm, lowering to stone). Interior contradiction—“trying to hear” vs. simply listening—drives the turn. The final quiet choice is earned and forecloses her prior frantic striving with felt cost. Voice occasionally drifts toward lyrical self-diagnosis but stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s guard-for-hire stoicism and dreamless sleep are stated more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (refusing the merchant) is coherent but not costly enough to feel like earned renunciation. Interiority is evocative (“I cultivate the sparks”) yet leans on abstract self-explanation rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she “found her staff” is the only externalized beat; more physical risk or hesitation would sharpen motivation. Still, the lens of accumulative endurance holds, and the final stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cyrus’s interiority is lyrical but consistent; the “hum of insight” gives his perceptions a concrete signature. Yet he never makes a micro-choice that risks anything—the gear is received, the doorway simply opens—so the change feels bestowed rather than earned. Cost is aesthetic, not personal. Voice remains coherent, but passivity caps the arc at “strong,” not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The old woman’s interior contradiction between safety and aliveness is embodied in the coiled leash; the final release is earned by the twilight vigil and the indirect climb. Micro-choices (rising despite protesting joints, letting the leash fall) show hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flaw: the guides remain symbolic observers; their silence keeps relational pressure off-page so status shift is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s guilt-shocked muteness and regenerated nerves are embodied in every beat; the pocketed bolt is a tactile micro-choice that externalizes his self-indictment. Interior contradiction—safety as accomplice to danger—drives the final ascent. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“unpardonable silence”) that slightly over-articulates what the imagery has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Threnody’s patience-versus-vengeance contradiction is implied but never enacted in-scene; she annotates, smiles, and endures, so the choice is static, not pressured. No micro-choice alters her tactics after the first paragraph—she merely continues writing—so the “endless vigil” feels predetermined rather than earned. Cost is elegiac rather than personal, keeping the arc elegant but bloodless.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tapping ritual, the atlas relic, and the memory of bleaching all feel lived-in and specific. The moment she stops tapping and invents a new rhythm is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the story stays within single-POV safety. Interior contradiction is present—hope vs. grief—but could be pushed one beat further under pressure to hit the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s interiority is textured—bare toes curling, awkward confidence performed until real—but the decisive turn (“she made her choice”) is announced rather than dramatized with conflicting impulses on the page. The lineage heirloom and paternal sacrifice supply emotional back-pressure, yet the final stance feels slightly predetermined, muting the cost of her refusal to let the rebellion fade.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Yara’s lightning-given plant-sight and buried fear read through concrete micro-choices (silence at the greenhouse bench, tremor when the kite appears). Grandmother-granddaughter status shift is staged cleanly: Yara yields narrative control to Anya’s insurgent cue, their joint hand-clasp crystallizes the cost of abandoning secrecy. Interior contradiction—tradition vs. transformation—stays active in scene, not abstract. The embryo’s pulse answers their intent, so the closure choice is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist’s quiet, plant-tuned interiority is concrete and embodied; every freeze is a live somatic marker, not a label. Her refusal to “heal” in the therapeutic sense is a believable, earned stance, and the final image of the night-blooming cereus crystallizes her values without epiphany-speak. Micro-choices (transplanting, misting, waiting out the freeze) steadily reveal hierarchy of needs. Only minor slack: the grandmother “gift” line flirts with abstract shorthand, and the photograph’s emotional charge is asserted more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is painter-specific and embodied (“paint-stained fingers”), and her arc from fracture to multitudes is legible. The decisive shift—accepting faces as multitudes—carries cost via the broken box restored, earned by prior causality. Yet the external world offers no secondary pressure; she faces only architecture and cards, so relationship/status crucible is absent and the “crestfallen” wound is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choices (untangling threads) are present but solitary, keeping the score short of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tracker is vivid—albino-sensitized touch, “serene angry smile”—but he never makes a decision that changes his course; he only watches, touches, and finally dissolves. Interiority is evocative yet circular (“rage served no purpose… serenity remained”) without contradictory impulse in-scene. Disappearance is something done *to* him, not an earned renunciation; hence no visible cost scaled to the length. Voice keeps him memorable, but agency gap caps him mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the weight on her chest—but the moment of decision is abstracted into “she initiated the transmission” without micro-choice detail. Still, her contradiction (duty vs truth) stays live and the cost lands as the networks sing. A hair more embodied final beat would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s renunciation of violence and embrace of cultivation is embodied in every micro-gesture; the final paragraph crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The sandbag scrap functions as a tactile anchor for filial ambivalence, handled twice with shifting emotional weight. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously in scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Morwen’s “cool-headed” trait is shown through patient observation and the final refusal to seize; the rail-spike’s emotional transliteration lets embodied emotion surface without label-speak. Internal contradiction is present—fisherman pragmatism versus mystic receptivity—and the closing renunciation of noise costs him his old life of ordinary fishing. One micro-choice at each spire turn accumulates to the stance crystallization; no safety-hedging. Minor slip: “earned his reputation” is told, not embodied, but it is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s observant nature is dramatized through the catalog of family sins she has tracked since childhood; the contradiction exercise shows contradictory impulses (reform vs. inherited guilt) operating in-scene. The final decision—to hunt the real saboteur—carries credible cost because it forfeits her last hope of innocence-by-ignorance. Interiority stays concrete, but “orbits of regret” leans toward summary label; still, the rosewood nib as tactile heirloom and the proof-by-contradiction device ground her agency. Motivation is sustained, yet no secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s guilt-propulsion is vivid and embodied; the “constellation tattooist” tag remains ornamental, never once guiding her micro-choices or tool-use under pressure. Interiority is specific until the final beat, where “tether her guilt to its source” slips into label-speak, blunting the cost of the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s shift from clinging to permanence to allowing impermanence is embodied in tactile chalk-work and the pocketed tile; her contradictory impulses (fear of letting art die vs. need to hear herself) play out in-scene. Micro-choice—pressing the tile into the mandala—pays the cost of her old identity on the page. Interiority stays concrete (“comfortable wound,” “listening with her hands”) and avoids label-speak. The whimsical artist label is shown through off-beat perception rather than declared, earning the closing permission.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lysara’s retrocognitive entrapment is dramatized through soot-blackened fingers on tesserae and the looping visions that blur now/then; the boy’s muteness is shown, not labeled. The climactic transfer of “Soren” carries visible cost—her smile as ember, his iron-warmed palms—so the renaming feels earned. Interior contradiction is thin: we’re told she calls others “forgetful” but never see her chafe against that judgment in the moment. Still, the micro-choice to press the stone into his hands crystallizes her hierarchy of values and lands as credible endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s contradiction—ghostly despair yet mentor-mission—drives her micro-choice to lift the coin. The synesthetic trait (“tasted violets when she heard grief”) is embodied, not label-speak, and underwrites her final renunciation. Mira’s interiority is thinner; her pivot from collapse to belief is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost is felt more on Elara’s side. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: the spectral exile knowingly relinquishes her anchor to save another, foreclosing her own return.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s “affectionate skeptic” label is shown through her bodily reactions to the geode, not told; her micro-choice to press it to her temple crystallizes internal contradiction. Cost is felt: she forfeits her guarded distance when she accepts the crystal’s invitation. Interiority is concrete, but the leap from “static shock” to geode-awakening is under-motivated, so the beat lands at strong, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maren’s sensory gifts and post-Sleep vocation are concrete, her interiority vivid (“saltwater support her weight”). Yet the decisive shift—from observer to “voice of the unknown”—is declared more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page visibly forecloses an alternate path, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s vocation-driven interiority is vivid and consistent; her tactile empathy with buttons gives her a single, sharp lens. Yet the story keeps her in pure witness mode—no contradictory impulse or micro-choice ever risks failure, so the arc is flat. The final “return to cataloging” feels inevitable but cost-free, limiting earned change. A single beat where she mis-files a button and fears she’s silenced a voice would have opened the full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—between hiding and exposure, burned identity and latent courage—grounds every beat; the pillbox hand-off crystallizes her re-awakened agency with visible cost in the final image. Micro-choices (reading snow codes, climbing open ground) tighten to the thematic question of dormant valor. The ally’s late arrival dilutes relationship-as-crucible pressure, but the primary arc sustains. Voice remains coherent under stress; no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Interiority is textured (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) and the needle gives a tactile anchor, but no contradictory impulse is staged in real time; the wait is passive and the final step onto the barge merely restates what reflection already told us. Cost is abstract—no option is foreclosed on the page—so the arc stalls at observation rather than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s embodied patience and phototropic trait feel lived-in; the lantern-glass test of “gentle hands” is a clean micro-choice. Interior contradiction is light—no moment where gentleness risks self-injury or failure—so the arc rides texture more than wrench. Still, her final resolve to carry the oasis frequency home is credibly foreshadowed and costs her the certainty that her own world will listen. A hair deeper flaw-exposure would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s grief-anchored patience and the girl’s guarded vulnerability are rendered through tactile micro-choices (climbing rungs, soil tuck) that embody contradiction without label-speak. The gauge-tooth hand-off crystallizes a credible shift in both characters’ hierarchies of value. Cost is felt: the girl’s tears stop, Maren relinquishes talismanic control, and the rose’s winter stake is accepted. Interiority stays concrete; only the father’s quoted maxim flirts with aphorism, slightly softening the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s cellular grief for vanished species is viscerally embodied (“ghosts in her blood”), but the moment of decisive agency—her choosing the unborn-creatures atlas—is slightly under-written; the causal hinge from passive witnessing to active midwife is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her memory of every letter, the tactile spiral of the nest—but the final pivot to “weaver of connection” is declared rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. No contradictory impulse is staged on the page; the epiphany feels foregone. Still, her vocation and the embodied handling of the nest keep her above the 8-line.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s competences are vivid—headphones clamped, pencil scratching charts—but interiority leans paraphrastic (“she understood now…”) instead of simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The final choice is causally earned yet the felt cost is declared (“her cautious hope transformed”) rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are present but emotionally monovalent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and inherited duty are embodied in trembling hands and forward motion; the compass-warmth gives a tactile link to Grandfather that justifies pressing on. The final beat—“passages of possibility”—shows a credible, earned shift from terror to defiance, the cost being the lifelong fear she must keep carrying. Interior voice stays specific, avoiding therapy-speak; only slight over-naming of emotion (“mounting panic”) keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s synesthetic “face-blind” gift is vividly anchored in sensory process and memory of her mother’s vanishing; interiority stays specific. Motive—awaken empathy, not solve crime—is coherent and stakes escalate internally. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; she never really risks anything tactile, so cost is conceptual, not embodied. Meets 9- boundary but lacks micro-choice that could fail.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maren’s buried longing and the inherited shame/curiosity around her great-grandmother are vividly interiorised; the copper-nail habit and the micro-choice to wheedle access show contradictory impulses under pressure. The final resolve to confront erasure is causally rooted in decoded journals and felt cost (“institutional shame too great”). Missing is a second live character to act as crucible, so status pressure is off-page; still, her nervously confident stride lands a credible renunciation of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fiddler’s interiority is richly specific—her noticing of wind in firs, the silence between songs—yet her final acceptance of the flake’s vision is abrupt; the handshake between motive and act could be one beat deeper. Still, her lifetime vocation of “holding space for vanishing” credibly sets up the earned stasis of driving on with the shard. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, but the lone POV keeps the portrait coherent and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s inherited “territory philosophy” motivates every beat; the foreign bill is handled twice, embodying paternal code. Elena’s “perceptively calm” stance bends once—she asks Marcus to “help me dissuade the others,” a micro-choice that seals their alliance. Interiority is concrete (studying her “the way his father had studied rest stops”), never diagnostic. The final stance—dissolve, not sell—carries felt cost (“clean” money foregone) and is earned by the train-as-argument causality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and particular—Elara’s perception of star-language is vivid—but she never makes a micro-choice under pressure; the decision to “reach for her pen” is the first action and it lands on the final line, so the cost feels prospective, not paid. Motivation is coherent yet static: she already knows everything she needs, so the scene records recognition rather than forging it. Earned stasis is credible, but we don’t see contradictory impulses collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s isolation, interior contradiction, and embodied shame feel specific; the “miscast spell frozen in crystalline confession” gives his flaw a concrete price. Yet his emotional arc is narrated more than dramatized—only the final seed-planting shows a micro-choice with cost, so the turn from hubris to acceptance is told, not tasted. Still, the guardedness and gift-of-finding shape his tactics and keep him credibly flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The visionary’s interiority is vivid—her rooted body versus roaming mind creates a lived contradiction—but the final “choice” is largely symbolic (planting a clipping) rather than an actionable turn with visible trade-off; the emotional cost is felt yet causally under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clutching the burned card while trembling, yearning to fill soul-holes yet recognizing the irreversible price—are rendered in embodied, non-generic interiority. The final renunciation (sister absorbed, joy vacated) is fully earned by the orchard’s visual proof of cost. The only micro-slip is “fiercely gentle resolve” used twice, slightly abstract; still, motive tracks cleanly to the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ex-roadie/antiques appraiser contradiction is vivid and embodied; the tactile handling of wood and grille cloth shows a man using craft to buffer grief. Interiority slips into label-speak (“confident uncertainty” repeated) yet the final micro-choice—to drive toward the amp—earns its cost because the cloth turns from talisman to question in the same beat. Motivation stays bound to loss and public shame; no knowledge leaks. The refusal to stay safe is credible, but the emotional arithmetic is slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is textured through scholarly hunger and bodily awe; the seed’s glow syncing with her pulse shows embodied emotion. The shift from “discovery-for-fame” to “translator-as-kindling” is legible, yet the renunciation feels gently aspirational rather than forcibly costly, keeping the arc just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    Asa’s patient caretaker persona is consistent, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“she understood this hunger for rest”) rather than dramatized in a moment of choice; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. The single on-page decision—accepting new identities—repeats identically each tide, so no escalation of motive or cost is legible. Earned endurance is implied, yet the mechanical heart never strains or falters, so the price of her dedication remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margret’s interior contradiction—career-long fixation on concrete safety vs. the cave’s invitation to vulnerability—is concrete and embodied (“something crack in her chest”). Micro-choice to lift the pearl crystallizes her re-valuation and costs her prior professional detachment; the etched shells visibly re-weight her stance. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Voice remains coherent and specific to her evaluator lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is textured and embodied—tremor working through the accordion leather anchors her mental state. The graffiti epiphany lands as a plausible micro-choice that tilts her stance toward self-forgiveness. Yet the “voices” and breakdown remain abstract; we are told their logic once felt airtight, never shown how. The final renunciation—holding without playing—earns its quiet cost, but the prior causality is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The veiled dreamer’s arc is vivid: her trembling fingers on the parchment, the watch pressed to her ribs, the micro-choice to follow reversed time—each beat shows embodied, contradictory emotion. The cost is palpable when the watch falls silent and the door opens, a renunciation of ordinary life. Interiority stays specific; no label-speak intrudes. The “cautious exuberant heart” line edges close to summary, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—archival control vs. creative surrender—are alive in every beat; the final bow-stroke feels inevitable yet costly because her telepathic quirk and coffee-reading ritual have already staged the stakes inside her body. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only minor slip: the buried dream is named more than it is dramatized, muting the ache a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her professional eye reading “laughter in the way the colors swirled” is character-specific—but the text keeps telling us her motives are “sacred” or “holy” instead of letting a single contradictory impulse collide with the ritual; the result feels performed rather than lived, and the absence of any micro-choice that could fail keeps the arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrically particular (“the wind sang with a voice like her grandmother’s lullaby”), embodiment anchors each climb, and the final renunciation—tending as life-long arrival—carries earned cost. The only drag is a moment of clinical self-diagnosis (“she understood at last”) that momentarily converts lived tension into label; still, the hairpin’s quiet reprise in the last line shows the choice is paid for and binding.

    Mara’s professional mask and interior fatigue are crisply drawn; the mirrored self-confrontation supplies a credible micro-choice. Yet all other figures (Thomas, predecessor, tomorrow’s client) stay off-stage, so relationship/status crucible bullets are moot and the arc is purely internal. The “earned change” is tentative—she merely scatters thoughts—so cost feels symbolic rather than irrevocable. Still, interior contradiction and embodied emotion pass the bar for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mina’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (the cinnamon/woodsmoke memory lands without cliché); the decision to heft her own stone crystallizes a credible internal shift with visible cost. The researcher’s “backwards aging” remains a label—never embodied or tested under pressure—so his contradiction is asserted, not dramatized. Because the decisive change is hers alone, the story squeaks past the 9+ gate, but the mentor’s lack of micro-choice keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority is lyrically textured but remains static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The single on-page “choice” is to let the pulse return—an endurance already implicit from line 1—so no higher-stakes fork is tested. Cost is asserted (“she did not know if she would ever leave”) rather than paid in a beat we can point to. Character therefore reads as atmospheric mask, not evolving agent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s quiet custodial life and her later surrender to the mist are credibly rooted, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“she felt seen in a way she couldn’t explain”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to withhold the error report is sharp; the climactic choice is more surrender than decision, softening cost. Flaws complicate but the arc lands in credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—nightly “signifying” versus learned stillness—plays out in embodied beats (key tag palmed, lungs burning). The shift from striving to receptive quiet is credibly costed by nineteen years of lamps and three winters in icy holds. One micro-choice—pressing worn brass to chest while saffron threads braid the water—crystallizes the arc. Motivation never drifts; every beat serves the father-vow stake.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kira’s interiority is textured—her hush, her bodily tuning to coin-vibration, her grandmother’s oracular pessimism—but all contradiction is backstory. No live decision tests her “quietly enthusiastic” label; the final insight arrives as gentle confirmation rather than costly renunciation. She watches, listens, smiles: stance crystallizes, yet the page never forces her to relinquish or risk anything tangible. Earned stasis feels more inherited than individually paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Melencolia’s contradictory impulses—detachment demanded by her reaper role vs. the reawakened grief Elias triggers—play out in concrete beats: she hesitates over the copper box, lingers on the atlas page, finally names the monsters. Interiority stays embodied (“struck her hollow chest like a stone”) and avoids label-speak. The climactic micro-choice—naming the serpent “Elias’s Answer”—is causally rooted in the recording’s instruction and costs her the last veneer of numbness, earning credible renunciation. Only minor drift: the “heart grown back” conceit skirts the edge of diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mage’s “lukewarm” magic is not a label but a lived limit that dictates every tactical choice; his decision to let water-drip pace the repair grows out of embodied patience and paternal memory, culminating in a renunciation of spectacular power that costs him permanent bell-duty. Contradictory impulses—self-doubt vs. cosmic duty—coexist inside single beats (“earnestly naive enough to believe…wise enough to recognize”), satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s vocation and temperament fuse convincingly; her micro-choices (photograph drops, bottle recovery) externalize the need to rescue erased memory. Interiority stays concrete—"the blue seemed to hold its own memory"—and her final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits professional neutrality to become the town’s witness. The only bar to 9 is that no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; motivation is steady rather than battle-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s sentimental trait is declared repeatedly but never shapes a concrete micro-choice; the “scientist’s mask shattering” is abstract summary, not embodied beat. Interiority drifts into poetic generics (“letter from a beloved friend”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. No contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure—she simply weeps after the crystal already transforms, so the change feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quiet, ritualized competence of the watcher is embodied in the parachute-buckle tic and the finger-tracing of wind vectors; we feel the cost in white knuckles rather than labels. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where trust in his own numbers wars with the desire to break silence—so the arc is steady rather than sharpened. Still, the final release of the buckle shows a micro-choice that seals the night’s earned stasis and keeps the characterization above cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s numbness is conveyed through embodied, character-specific choices—sheathing the blade, the decision to “vivify.” Internal contradiction pulses cleanly: the clone feels while the original cannot. The final renunciation—accepting a shared consciousness—arrives with visible cost (the permanence of numbness cracked open) and is earned by the prior blade-to-chest beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is character-specific—orthogonal puzzles, brook-side vigils, seed vigilance—yet her contradictions remain summarized rather than enacted in-scene. No micro-choice visibly forks her path; the shift from commercial pressure to seed-patience is declared, not dramatized. Cost is felt, but only in reflective paraphrase (“commercial pressure mounting”) rather than an on-page forfeiture. The seed functions as thematic mirror, not crucible that forces a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.9)
    The protagonist’s solemn mission is evocative, yet all interiority is abstract—“he understood,” “he had learned”—so we never see contradictory impulses collide in real time. His only micro-choice is pulling the cord, an action repeated without escalating risk or revealing new layers of self. The piece insists on grief but dramatizes no moment where grief costs him anything concrete, so the ending’s “traces would rise” feels wished-for rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Warden’s voice is lyrically specific—hair tangled with pages, eyes “pale luminescence of margins.” The ache is embodied, the final micro-choice (walk forward) emerges from prior reflection; cost is the seventeen winters surrendered. Interiority risks rarefied abstraction (“dimensionally homesick”) yet stays anchored to pendant heat and fog. Just shy of 9: no contradictory on-page impulses, but the turn feels more epiphanic than wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—priest-turned-alchemist clinging to a relic she once broke—drives every micro-choice; the final snap is earned by seventeen years of iterated failure shown, not told. Emotion is embodied in frost-numbed hands and breath that refuses to mist, avoiding diagnostic labels. The “stoic sensitivity” trait surfaces once as a label but is otherwise dramatized through controlled ritual gesture, keeping the slip minor. Renunciation lands with visible cost: empty hands, spent fire, destiny interrupted.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior contradiction—clinging to empirical training while surrendering to unmeasurable silence—plays out in embodied micro-choices (tuning stance, weeping) that visibly cost her composure. The final renunciation of measurable certainty is earned by the prior causality of the fragment's resonance and the silence's invitation. However, the lack of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible pressure; still, her solitary stance crystallizes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maren’s interiority is textured (“she had learned to measure journeys by the quality of silence between stars”), but the climactic self-sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses; we never feel her fear or hesitation, only her serenity. The empty hourglass reappears but does not constrain any micro-choice in-scene, so the promised cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fever dream architect is compelling through her craft-centered interiority, but her motivations remain elegant abstractions rather than urgent needs; the contradiction between “rational enchantment” and her own overwritten memories is vivid yet never forces a visible on-page micro-choice that costs her anything tangible until the final quiet sit-down. That final endurance reads more as poetic stasis than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost, so the change/renunciation 9+ test is not quite met.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The anchor-chain object functions as a layered externalization of Mira’s lineage and forward pull; her embodied emotion (“cold metal press against her ribs”) is concrete and stakes the present beat. Interiority stays close to perception—“balancedly curious” is the students’ label, not self-diagnosis, so avoids label-speak. One missed opportunity: the grandmother’s aphorism arrives as paraphrase, not dramatized memory, muting the interior contradiction that could have lifted the final renunciation to full cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s grief-work expertise is vivid, but her interior contradiction—professional skepticism vs. need to believe—stays summarized; we never see a micro-choice that costs her. The final run to the atrium is action without visible trade-off or risk, so the “heroism” feels attributed, not earned. Vera’s single beat of handing over the aid is poignant yet purely functional; no secondary pressure complicates Elena. Closure hinges on hearing the message, not on Elena paying a price for transmitting it, so the change is Vera’s, not the protagonist’s.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maren’s contradictory fear of enclosure vs. hunger for knowledge is kept embodied and particular; the moment she touches the gold the interior terror and wonder coexist on the skin. The final fusion is the only credible payoff to her apprentice/mentor bond and is charged with visible cost: she forfeits lungs, solitude, the surface world. Micro-choices (hand on codex, feeling gold “spread across her skin like liquid light”) crystallize the hierarchy of values. No safety-hedging—flaw (claustrophobia) directly enables the transcendence she chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—rage at the system versus ache for its maker—grounds every beat; the pulse-counting habit embodies her exile and is surrendered in a credible renunciation. Yet the architect-ghost remains off-stage, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the final forgiveness feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive to “translate texture into sound” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why she alone accepts the ancestral bargain—stays summary; the diamond’s warmth and the final lifting of the curse register as embodied cost, yet the beat where she chooses to speak is compressed into lyric evocation rather than dramatized micro-choice, muting the stakes of that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s curiosity and residual loyalty to Amari are clear, but her interiority drifts into abstract paraphrase (“fear and wonder warring”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final step-forward is a stance shift, yet it feels willed by the cosmic metaphor rather than by a prior micro-choice that exacts a visible cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the arrowhead remains symbolic cargo, never a decision pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—she “clutches” the violin, feels the statues’ gaze “behind her eyes,” and her heartbeat syncs with the shell. The contradiction between her yearning for wonder and the risk of stone-immobility is embodied, not labelled. The final renunciation—letting the shell fall—pays the accumulated cost of crossing twelve bridges and playing herself into jeopardy, earning Charged Poise. The only hairline slip: “signal that needed no translation” flirts with abstraction, but the embodied heartbeat quickly re-grounds us.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s “serve the people first” ethos is dramatized in the risk he accepts for Aram’s package and the storm vessel; the moment he pockets the medicine and tells the boy the code, we see a micro-choice that costs him plausible danger. Interiority is concrete—weight of the bag, taste of twilight copper—without lapsing into label-speak. The sisters’ silence motif shows contradiction: he both honors censorship and subverts it. Final stance crystallizes with earned cost: he walks toward the fence carrying criminal evidence, foreclosing neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but floats above embodied choice; the “quietly persistent” trait is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-decisions. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; the wrong turn, singing, and halo retrieval happen in passive wonder. The final resolve to build is announced, not forged under pressure, so the cost feels prospective, not paid. Meets the 9+ quick test only weakly—no causal friction visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Miriam’s motivation is legible—her lifelong devotion to analog stories drives every action—but she never faces a hard choice or contradiction; the reawakening simply happens once she activates the room. The grandmother’s heir is a functional prop, not a crucible. No cost or renunciation lands on Miriam, so the arc is flat. Still, her embodied odd-hour rhythm and tactile attention to the scarf keep her from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s solitude and quiet perseverance are rendered through tactile caretaking of books and pigment; her interior contradiction—yearning for absence yet restoring presence—surfaces only in the final photograph, so the arc feels more observed than dramatized until the last beat. The micro-choice to hang the self-portrait beside her desk crystallizes her acceptance, but earlier beats lack visible trade-offs that would raise the cost sooner. Still, her embodied attention to weather-warped pages keeps her from abstraction and earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The locksmith’s guarded interiority is rendered in concrete, character-specific images (“deliberately forgettable,” “rehearsed into ordinariness”), and the final smile shows a credible, earned release. Yet the long reflective block (≈30 %) is mostly summary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time, so the emotional cost feels reported rather than lived under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s obsessive need to recover his grandmother’s face is viscerally embodied (tears in brine) and fuels every beat; the thirty-year gap is confessed, not dramatized, so the depth of conversion is told more than shown, but the closing micro-choice—swimming off to keep hunting—pins the cost of “acceptance beyond proof” to his body.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren’s “combative tenderness” is shown through concrete micro-moves—stepping backward to give space, pouring tea in silence—so motive stays embodied. The children’s terror-to-curiosity shift is dramatized in the boy’s un-stopped reach for the cup, a credible hinge of resilience. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the mentor philosophy (“exile is not a punishment”) that edges toward diagnostic label-speak, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s gentle stewardship is evocatively embodied—“she sang to the wounds in the bark”—but she never faces a contradictory impulse or risk that forces a costly choice; her competence is serene, not stressed. The only micro-choice, planting the seed, merely fulfills an intention set long before the scene, so no interior clash or visible price is legible on the page. Without a tightening moment where her creativity or loyalty is tested, characterization remains atmospheric rather than arc-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s vocation and back-story are vividly particularized; the childhood memory flashback crystallizes motive. Yet her interiority stays in luminous, slightly detached metaphor—“the interlaced hush…settling like fine dust”—which can read as performed rather than felt under peak pressure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the choice to finish unravelling is never seriously doubted, so the final “Earned Stasis” costs less than it could. Still, her perception governs every image, making the character line indivisible from the texture of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s “methodically curious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; she never makes a costly on-page choice that forecloses future access. The renunciation at the end is admirable but causally under-motivated—no prior beat shows her risking or losing anything by refusing to excavate. Interiority is evocative yet abstract (“the past yearned to speak”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interiority is consistently embodied and character-specific; Miriam’s micro-choices under pressure (“she descended alone… measured cycles… guided… worked the seal free”) trace a legible value-hierarchy with visible cost. The note discovery sparks a credible, earned shift from compulsive searching to deliberate messenger, crystallizing her arc without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to be heard yet performing to emptiness—drives every micro-choice; the final duet with the ghost costs her the last pretense of solitude, a renunciation earned by the bolt-plate cue and the seventeen-year solitude established early. The only bar to 9+ is that her physical risk remains abstract—no felt bodily cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s curiosity is anchored early and drives the beat that opens the diary; her micro-choice to read instantly sharpens internal conflict. The renunciation at the end—silently returning the goggles—carries a quiet cost (betrayal of trust vs. compassion) that feels earned. Interiority is concrete when the symbols “rearrange themselves,” but once the text turns to summary of Jansen’s grief the embodiment thins. Still, the hierarchy of values is clear: compassion over curiosity, sealed with a visible gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Miriam’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. emotional cloud-taxonomy—are alive in scene; the final renunciation of solid ground is earned by her prior micro-choices under the swaying gondola. One slip: “quiet explosiveness” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand in the peak beat, softening the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s face-blindness is more a label than a lived contradiction; it never complicates a single beat or limits her choices under pressure. Interiority is vivid (“the tree’s slow breathing”) yet remains lyrically external; we glimpse no clashing impulse or visible cost when she decides to paint the sky. The final renunciation—leaving without claiming recognition—carries conceptual cost, but because the choice is summary, the emotional price is inferred rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct enough to lift the portrait above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s curiosity is credibly embodied—thumb on worn phrasebook, night-long measuring—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a risky choice; the climax is observation, not stakes-laden decision, so the cost feels intellectual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thessa’s interiority is lyrically particular—her moon-lit fingers, driftwood nostalgia—but the only micro-choice on stage is the ritual offering of the gears; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies it, so the arc feels foreordained rather than earned. The “rhythm of repair” is asserted, not dramatized under pressure. Still, the voice-soaked perception keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s gentle persistence and the settlers’ gradual shift from survival-mode hoarding to open-handed collaboration are sketched with warmth, yet everyone remains a touch archetypal (“kind eyes,” “frightened child”). No one faces an interior contradiction that complicates their newfound generosity; the change feels communal rather than personally costly. The ghost’s motivation is clear—she wants the bell rung—but the settlers’ hinge moment is more emblematic than individually embodied. Still, the ensemble’s micro-choices (Eli teaching, Lena giving) align cleanly with the stakes and earn the closing rain.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her fingers “knowing every brass gear… like the lines of her own face”—but the text repeats the same emotional chord (accepting, lyrical resignation) without contradictory impulse or rising cost. The final beat is pure affirmation rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path; we never see her risk or lose anything tangible. The “thousand lifetimes” refrain is poetic, yet accumulates as label-speak because it isn’t tested by a micro-choice that could fail. Still, her tactile intimacy with the clock and puppet gives her a distinct perceptual signature strong enough for the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s inherited dread and reluctant caretaker mantle are viscerally embodied in the weight-transfer image; her micro-choice to kneel and insert the nut crystallizes a hierarchy of values—strangers’ lives over perpetual solitude—yet the interior contradiction between duty and desire stays more summarized than simultaneously enacted in scene. The final ascent costs her the last warmth she carried, a visible price, but the emotional layering flattens slightly because the traveler voices are heard, not faced, so status dynamics and relational crucible remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam’s interiority is textured—her scientific lens on grief feels lived-in, and the chrysalis-in-pocket micro-choice keeps her present. The contradiction between guilt and her mother’s explicit absolution is held simultaneously in the foam-tracing beat, not summarized away. Final stance shift is earned: the emptied chrysalis re-read as completion rather than abandonment carries a visible cost because she pockets it again before standing, sealing the conversion. Voice slips once into generic “symphonic” abstraction, but body and motive stay coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is evocative (“she loved it for that”) but stays lyrical and observant; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final “new understanding” is declared rather than shown through a micro-choice that costs her something tangible. No embodied emotion undercuts the epiphany. Still, the vendor’s perceptual filter is specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Miriam’s interior contradiction—needing to unload centuries of grief yet refusing to swallow it herself—is dramatized in the embodied act of cooking against coral. The micro-choice to serve an empty room a tagine of reconciliation shows her hierarchy of values at cost. Closure’s “sturdy brittle” fatigue is legible payment. Dialogue is absent, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; solo POV baseline met.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet decision to believe” carries weight—but the story tells us she “had rehabilitated” rather than dramatizing a single contradictory impulse in-scene; the Romanian/Ukrainian/Spanish switches are reported, not lived under pressure. The final choice to act is clear and earned, yet the cost (lost evenings, social risk) is asserted, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s recursive-cortex trait and tactile mirror ritual are vivid; the “synaptic pathways reorganize” moment embodies the change. Interior contradiction is thin—no second voice pushing back—so the renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than fought for. Still, her embodied awe and final stance carry cost and specificity; the archeologist identity lands as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Calyx’s obsession is palpable and embodied; the twenty-year wait and bodily ascent chart a credible arc from fear to mastery. Interiority is rich (“blazing with a fire that had been latent too long”), but the beat where she presses the marking lacks a micro-choice that shows cost—success feels pre-ordained. The prism-minded trait is repeatedly dramatized, yet no contradictory impulse tests her, so the change reads as triumph, not crucible. Still, the single-POV default is exceeded cleanly and the final stance is foreclosed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s slow, attentive nature is embodied in every gesture; the porcelain-insulator “read” is a lovely micro-choice that shows her synesthetic mind. Yet her interiority never cracks under contradiction—she wants music, she gets music, cost is only ambient silence—so the arc feels more confirmation than transformation. Still, the final sonic bloom is credible because her patience has been dramatized, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is rich—“he had learned that waiting itself was a kind of teaching”—but no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the worry-stone ritual recurs without altering tactics. The exiled tutor’s only on-page “choice” is to rise and wait again, so the renunciation never costs him a visible alternative. Precise thinker is shown in cadence, yet the story summarizes seven years of teaching instead of dramatizing one risky lesson that could have fractured the covenant on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s pacifism is lived in her refusal to pry the clasp with metal tools and her turning instead to resonance; the interior contradiction between scientific precision and emotional need is felt in “she pressed her ear against its silver wings.” Micro-choices under pressure—dialling, listening, writing—track a hierarchy of values (preservation > possession). The final renunciation is earned: the diary opens not by brute frequency but by the exact emotional pitch of “ready to receive,” a costed stance crystallized in the closing line about spent thoughts. The only gap is that her forty-year catalog remains abstract; we are told, not shown, how any single silence once altered her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kalia’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. the stillness the corpse flower demands—is dramatized through daily micro-choices (breathing through aversion, steady harvest). The final renunciation of raw ambition is earned by the months-long causality of scent-based endurance; the cost is legible in the single-line journal entry and the wildflower doodle that replaces the spiral. Only cap is the off-page “three weeks” summary that keeps the endurance from being fully embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cora’s curiosity-as-hunger is vivid, embodied in the opening palm-on-glass beat and the irreversible decision to touch the arrow. Interiority stays specific and contradictory: wonder v. fiduciary duty, pilot competence v. superstitious certainty. The final renunciation lands with visible cost—she seals the viewport on profit and carries silence instead—earned by the prior tactile vision of accelerated decay. Only the “eleven seasons” résumé line feels résumé-flat amid otherwise taut micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s professional gaze and methodical documentation are vivid, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“reminder of pattern recognition”). No micro-choice visibly costs her anything; the climax is pure cognition. The patch never re-enters action to refract motive. Competent, but the arc is observation, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Yara’s synesthetic blessing gives her a concrete, character-specific way of perceiving the world, and every beat stays filtered through that lens; her interiority is vivid, never generic. Yet we get no contradictory impulse or micro-choice that visibly costs her anything—she simply follows the inherited script, so the arc feels like enactment rather than earned change. The tears that freeze are the sole embodied cost, but they arrive at the very end and read as affirmation, not sacrifice. Without a moment where her unique gift forces her to relinquish a live alternative, characterization stays competent but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s guilt and need for penance are vivid, but the interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“failure was not a single moment but a long process…”) that flattens the embodied cost. The final shift to “witness rather than intervene” is credible, yet the beats showing her arriving at this renunciation are compressed into a single reflective paragraph, so the contradiction never fully combusts on the page. Still, the flute-as-weight and the driftwood ritual give us two tactile micro-choices that keep her from sliding into pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is richly concrete—amber light as “a condition of perception,” personalities borrowed like tools—embedding contradictory impulses (curiosity vs self-erasure) in every beat. Micro-choices (holding the fragment to her chest, dissolving into its light) visibly foreclose the path of intact identity. Seventeen accumulated emotional debts accumulate as receipts, paying off in the ending’s transparent liberation. The only absence is an on-page second character, so relationship/status bullets are rightfully N/A; still, the self-other boundary erodes convincingly alone.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s jittery courier trait is embodied early and re-anchored in trembling hands; the pendant beat shows micro-choice that tilts confidence. Interiority stays concrete, though the final shift to “steady and certain” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, contradictory impulses (grief vs. forward motion) coexist in-scene, and the renunciation of old self-doubt carries visible cost under the aurora closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her bare feet in moss, the prism’s cold flash—and her drive to “prove” emotional archaeology is dramatized through careful attention to frost patterns. The beat where she realizes she herself is becoming another absorbed object carries visible cost: “her own essence slowly merging with the stone.” No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc from observer to participant lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    The loom-spinner’s contradictory impulses—yearning to finish the weave yet hoarding the self she must surrender—are dramatized in the slow-motion decision to cut her own thread. Every micro-choice (sorting edges, lifting the bead, reaching for the scissors) is visible, embodied, and irreversible, so the final self-unraveling feels causally earned. The cost is scaled to the length: one life traded for one message. No interior label-speak; the silence itself externalizes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cael’s quiet endurance is embodied in the steady hammer-work and the choice to keep clearing tunnels when others quit; the moment he buries the luminous silk in the supports crystallizes a value hierarchy (beauty → utility) with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“preferred the familiar weight of hammer on anvil”—and the final return to the humming forge is an Earned Stasis that forecloses rest or acclaim. The only minor slip is a late, slightly abstract phrase—“teaching his world to dream again”—that momentarily softens the embodied arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira’s interior contradiction—gift as wound—is dramatized in the final beat when she lowers the shard and accepts endless exile; the embodied cost is felt. Earlier, however, her choices are reported rather than shown (“she had come to redirect the flow”) so agency is muffled. Mentor absence keeps relational pressure off-stage; the crucible is purely intra-subjective, acceptable but thinner. The cyclical memory loss is label-stated, not demonstrated mid-action, muting flaw-driven mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maren’s reticence and observant warmth are shown through silent action—reading the stone stacks, pocketing the sea glass, stacking the seven stones. The grandmother’s loss and the inherited pull toward lighthouses give her a believable, emotionally anchored motive. The final act of stacking is a concrete, costly choice that dissolves her grandmother’s presence, earning the change. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mood-rich interiority but no contradictory impulse under pressure; keeper never doubts or wavers, so the “accidental” trait feels declared, not dramatized. Final stance reprises earlier beat without new cost. Voice distinctive yet emotionally static.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yuen’s interiority is concrete—dye-master patience, transplant strangeness—and his micro-shift from passive watching to active “return to his dye vats” is earned. The inherited-story capacity is slightly abstract, but the new-heart beat at the end bodies it. No contradictory impulses on page simultaneously; reflection dominates action. Still, the single-POV arc of becoming a story-vessel is credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The warden’s solitary vigil is rendered with textured interiority—her nineteen autumns, the sextant’s weight, the desire to “discover what trees witness” all braid into a credible, occupation-specific psyche. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, however; the micro-choice to lift the sextant is the only visible decision, so the arc leans on contemplative endurance rather than tested flaw. Still, the voice-bound attention to sorrow’s mass gives her a memorable, particular loneliness that earns the quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shattered mirror” mind shown through tactile ritual—but her contradictory impulses remain summary (“laughed and wept”) rather than dramatized in the decisive beat. The final self-dispersion is motivated, yet the cost reads abstract because the prose tells “she became less whole” instead of rendering the felt erasure beat-by-beat. A single on-page micro-choice under final stress would have lifted this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—compassion vs self-preservation—is stated more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (smoothing the letter) is too late to escalate stakes. The “compassionate recluse” label is repeated without embodied cost until the final sentence promise; we witness no moment where empathy actually hurts her in-scene. The arc is a renunciation-to-return, but the renunciation happens off-page years ago, so the visible cost is only asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s quiet stewardship is rendered with sensitive interiority and credible ritual; her micro-choices (breaking bread, releasing vines) visibly enact her vocation. Yet the absence of live opposition keeps pressure interior and stakes modest, so the “earned cost” bar is only just cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is textured and profession-specific; the archivist’s “quartz hush” addiction and micro-footstep care feel lived-in. Yet the epiphany—“preserve meaning, not magic”—is declared rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse or external resistance tests her, so the change reads as serene acceptance, not costly renunciation. Still, the embodied ritual of slide-handling keeps her motive legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s patience and wariness feel lived-in; the watch-fob as tactile heirloom anchors her motives. Yet her interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“what it meant to capture the sound of trust breaking”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final micro-choice—risk keeping the fob—reads more as thematic echo than as a value hierarchy forced by prior causal beats; cost is implied, not felt. Still, her perceptual filter stays consistent and specific to a smuggler’s child.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s bioluminescence and skepticism are vivid, but her shift from passive observer to active questioner is soft—no hard choice or forfeiture charges the ending. The interiority glows (“questions everything this glow revealed”) yet never collides with an irreversible cost. Seren’s storm-body is memorable, but her function is expositional rather than pressuring Mira into a visible trade-off. Closure relies on a tasted “possibility” rather than a concrete decision that burns a bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven duty vs. fear of repeating erasure—are embodied in the trembling charcoal hand that finally moves toward canvas; the lock’s weight in pocket and “charcoal crescents” keep past complicity alive in the body. Micro-choice to kneel and begin painting crystallizes renunciation of her former gate-keeping with visible cost (she forfeits her identity as mere documentarian). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, mineral taste and prismatic shadows render emotion. Closure choice earns its beat because every remembered discouragement has been dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—gossamer sheets, gold leaf on cuffs—and her grief for her 师傅 is embodied in the hush of the greenhouse tunnels. The final decision to write the unspoken words is earned by the map journey and the visual proof of his gilded letters. Yet the stakes of her own silence (what she personally risks by speaking) stay abstract; we see her inherit the task more than struggle with it. A sharper contradiction inside her—fear of toxic air vs fear of dishonesty—would have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“blue that existed only in ancient ice”—and her seasonal muteness grants a memorable perceptual filter. Yet we see no contradicting impulse mid-scene; the moment of approval from Juniper lands as pure affirmation, not crucible. The sculpture, not the woman, bears the visible cost, so her change is observational rather than enacted. Motivation is clear, but the beat that would foreclose a path or expose flaw is deferred to winter.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction pulses vividly—organic blood in titanium limbs, fear-box cradled yet never opened. Micro-choice chain is legible: keep box → open box → inhale fears → fold them origami-tight. Cost is felt when she “fragments into all the moments she had contained”—a body-count of memory paid in real time. Final endurance (empty box, upright roses) reads as Earned Stasis with her rebuilt hands still trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elena's interiority is prettily written ("sandstorm calm") but abstract; the only concrete choice she makes is to open a mailbox she has stared at for weeks, a decision telegraphed rather than pressured. The promised flaw—"following curiosity like a thread"—never complicates or endangers her; she simply succeeds. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; even the final realization is delivered as summary ("she understood finally"). Emotional cost is asserted, not embodied: the sisters’ reunion happens offstage and we are told, not shown, that "listening heals."

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—weaponizing the silence forced on her—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to dance the cipher in the drained chamber crystallizes her arc. Motivation tightens elegantly: every thrown dot of the dice is a day survived and a promise kept, so the final step toward daylight feels earned, not gifted. The only minor slack: “lyrical code breaker” is asserted more than dramatized in middle beats. Still, the cost of her transformed voice—movement instead of speech—lands with felt weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s lantern-lighter identity is more atmospheric label than lived vocation—she never handles a lantern or makes a work-choice under pressure. The exhuming of her mother’s grave-flowers is a vivid, value-laden act, but the deleted-memory quest stays interior; we watch her decide to “let the light in” without seeing a concrete, costly micro-choice that seals the change. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward poetic self-explication (“she finally understood…”) rather than dramatized contradiction in scene. Still, the filial grief and keeper lineage feel specific, and the final touch of the crystal carries embodied cost, earning a solid mid-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The summoner’s interiority is consistently concrete—her breath “rising like ghost-motes,” the “weight…pressing against the inside of her skull”—and her micro-choices (kneel, trace silence, release the wing) track a credible shift from dread to purposeful renunciation. The contradiction between mastered binding arts and the new art of “unmaking” is held in-scene, not abstractly declared. Cost is felt: she forfeits the security of prophecy itself, a loss legible in the final image of the wing drifting away. The only limit is the absence of a second character to test status dynamics, but at this length the solo crucible suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s curiosity-to-necessity shift is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (hand over the tutor’s, decision not to ask). The tutor’s “dead” presence is shown via cool touch and reverent handling of seal; interior contradiction pulses in Elena’s simultaneous longing and restraint. Final renunciation (“I don’t need to know”) costs her full knowledge yet feels earned. Cap at 8.7 because the tutor’s pre-story timeline remains partly opaque, slightly blunting cost scale.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s skepticism and secret receptivity coexist convincingly in the first half; the embodied moment of holding the shell against her ear shows micro-choice. Yet the interior turn “Her skepticism shattered not with dramatic suddenness but with the quiet acceptance…” is told, not dramatized, so the emotional cost feels pre-cooked. Because the decisive shift is summarized, motivation jumps rather than intensifies, keeping the arc solid but not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yuki’s contradictory impulses—obedience to inherited silence vs. the need to restore—are present but stay interior; no embodied micro-choice under live pressure dramatizes the turn. The moment she “approached it with the right combination of skill and intention” tells us renunciation happened instead of letting us watch the irreversible forfeiture. Cost is named (“too dangerous to carry”) but not felt on the body or future options. Interiority is vivid yet remains cerebral; a single externalized gesture of loss would have sealed the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s loneliness and perception are evocatively sketched, but she never makes a visible choice; the tension between her gift and wound is declared, not dramatized. Interiority drifts into abstract cosmology (“to hear everything was to understand…”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure means motivation stays static; closure is a step into mist, not a costly act. The result is atmospheric but unmotivated portraiture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s vocation is vivid—dream-mining grief to reconstruct a lost child—but her interiority stays at a reverent distance; we witness care (“tended flickering memories”) yet no moment where contradictory impulses collide under pressure. All micro-choices are reported rather than dramatized, so the climactic decision to “find the living relatives” feels pre-ordained, not earned through on-page risk or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Yuki’s interior contradiction—net-mender practicality versus moon-lit metaphysics—survives every beat; the whisk-hand habit, parapet touch, and whistle are embodied micro-choices that externalize her hierarchy of values. Static position and no second character keep relational/status bullets off the page, but her renunciation of explanation with her father (last paragraph) carries a felt relational cost that caps the arc. The only bar to 9+ is the absence of a second live pressure source on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira’s investigator persona is sketched cleanly—her training surfaces in an immediate, embodied beat (pressed back / sweep). Interior contradiction is missing: she never doubts or fears; the single choice to “transmit her findings” is reported, not dramatized, so no cost is legibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“loneliness crystallise into hope” is earned. The contradictory loyalties (science vs mystic) are dramatized in her choice to press palm to glass, not merely asserted. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; cost is conceptual (variant allegiance validated) rather than visceral. Still, the variant stance is embodied and drives the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s shift from coin-for-verses hustler to intergenerational translator is believable because the music-box trigger is tactile and the granddaughter’s arrival forces a public surrender; interiority is vivid (“unraveled something in his chest”) but stops short of contradictory-in-scene tension, and the final vocation feels slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and sensorily anchored; Maren’s remembered trauma of tearing metal counterweights sterile “C-sharp” calculation. The grandmother’s key as inherited obligation supplies credible back-pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene—terror and duty are named sequentially rather than splitting a single beat—so we miss the highest band edge.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kira’s solitary obsession is evoked through tactile ritual—compass spins, palm on warm basalt—yet her interior contradictions remain mostly summarized (“restless energy…transforming it into something more durable”). The final unyoking pays off her grandfather’s journal thread, but the cost is more announced (“the subtle release”) than embodied; still, the arc from observer to catalyst is coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her grip on the lantern, the jaw-tighten at Chen—but the inherited-memory beat arrives as external download, not earned contradiction. No micro-choice in-scene wrestles with the entangled memories; they simply overwrite her, so the final “I’ll publish” lacks felt cost. The lantern lineage is shown, yet its emotional weight is asserted, not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Father Thomas’s interiority is textured—his chaplain past informs micro-choices (hesitating over the spring, remembering Marcus) and yields a credible renunciation (hidden inscription). Yet the emotional contradiction promised by the rubric is only summarized (“wondered whether fixing…too simple”) rather than enacted in scene. Cost is present but soft: no visible fallout or risk to him. Still, the occupation-specific detail and the final act of sacral repair lift the portrayal above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single, reliably curious consciousness drives every sentence; the cart glider’s micro-choices (angling the arrow tip, turning the scope “to the position the image demanded”) externalize contradictory pulls between cargo-protocol and transcendence. Interiority is tactile—wooden ribs, brass fittings—never label-speak. Flaw: no opposing will onstage means status pressure is theoretical; hence capped just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s “bright attentiveness” is shown through concrete pattern-reading choices that escalate stakes; the final decision to leave the door open is earned by her prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays specific (“she understood then why the case had come to her”) without therapy-speak. Flaw—no embodied contradiction in the final beat; the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping at 7.9.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—wanting to “map empathy onto action” while carrying shadows—surfaces early and recurs, but the final choice to carry the fragment toward the ships is more asserted than dramatized; we see the compass-like swing yet feel no bodily cost or risk that would foreclose an alternative path. Her calm intuition is consistently filtered through orchard, ice, and mirror imagery, but the emotional crescendo is compressed into one abstract exhalation. Still, the hierarchy of values (truth over easy peace) remains legible and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the parasol tip as tactile anchor keeps her present. The “fold in patience” decision arrives off-stage, so the decisive pivot feels reported rather than dramatized. Micro-choices in the wreck-trawling beats show loosening grip, but no contradictory impulse actively fights her exit plan—risk arithmetic is one-way. Enough specificity to reach high band, yet the final stance is already secured before the scene starts, trimming cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through vineyard-honed perception; the burned fragment as tactile memory keeps contradictions alive. His final smile is earned because the letter fragment, the empty station, and the dormant vines all press him into a conscious renunciation whose cost is felt. The only slip is a brief drift into abstract rumination (“love’s purpose was not always permanence”) that momentarily softens embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s half-mask and peripheral-seeing trait are vivid, but she never makes a micro-choice that costs her anything; the walk is observational. The interior contradiction between “seeing too much” and “truly important seeing” is announced, not dramatized. Because no boundary actually shifts or breaks during the patrol, the promised “endurance with cost” stays conceptual. The final beat is a restatement of motive, not a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maren’s quiet, attentive stance is consistent and embodied, but the piece never forces her to test or renounce it; she “lingers” and “waits” without a tightening beat that costs her anything. The interiority is textured yet stays safely within self-reinforcing mindfulness, so no contradictory impulse breaks the calm. Because no live option is foreclosed, the “earned endurance” feels more observed than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s reticence and compulsive cataloguing feel lived-in; the crystal theft is a believable, character-specific trespass. Interiority stays concrete (“whispered to himself…crystal answered”) and avoids label-speak. The final smile is earned: silence chosen after a lifetime of words, cost visible in the empty stacks. Missing external pressure from another character keeps it just shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s precognitive forgetfulness is vividly embodied—she forgets the future while clutching chalk to stay present—but the piece never tests the trait under duress; she drifts to the fountain, listens, and smiles without a micro-choice that costs her anything. The interior contradiction is stated, not dramatized; the final “peace” arrives as thematic label rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and sensorially grounded; the narrator’s grief and craft knowledge feel lived-in. Micro-choices (lifting the camera, refocusing on the hand) visibly trace the shift from fixation to acceptance. The father promise acts as a credible wound, but the “sage” self-label feels slightly grandiose for a solitary man who never interacts; still, the arc earns its renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s calm-with-terminal-diagnosis interiority is embodied in micro-choices (call to Margery’s daughter, spoon-on-mug rhythm) that externalize “decisively kind.” The final grip-and-gaze beat crystallizes Earned Stasis: she foregoes personal protest, pays with finite time, yet the contradiction—serene while dying—remains dramatized, not labeled. Only a hint of diagnostic-speak (“she felt a strange clarity descend”) keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s scholar identity is signaled early and her quiet deliberation shows in micro-choices (soft footsteps, cross-legged sit), but interiority drifts into stock phrasing (“never wished more desperately”) and the final beat is delivered as declarative summary rather than embodied cost; the key’s warmth is the only tactile consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective love vs. self-protective refusal—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, placing the tooth). The final renunciation (refusing to ID the body) costs her societal closure yet is fully earned via the luminescent constellation image. Interiority stays concrete, though one moment of therapy-speak (“cleft in certainty”) nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete—tracing walls by feel, weighing sea glass against lost constellations—but the arc drifts toward summary once the pearl arrives; the pivotal “realization” is told more than dramatized, muting the embodied cost of choosing to stay and shine rather than ascend. The seventeen-year exile is vivid, yet the final stance crystallizes in exposition, not a visible micro-choice that hurts. Still, her flawed, light-hungry voice is particular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    The interior life is textured and body-attuned (“amber warm against my heart”), yet the arc is overwhelmingly reflective—no on-page choices test her stance after arrival. Confusion/betrayal are named rather than dramatized; we watch her feel, not act. The final “simply stay” lands as an earned renunciation, but because the story withholds any second character or live dilemma in-scene, motivation stays abstract and mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The interiority is poetic but remains abstract; the “hollow in her chest” and “afraid” are label-level. The decisive shift—“she was ready to write”—is stated, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the renunciation of fear is asserted, not earned through visible action.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s grief-tinged devotion and generational guilt are vivid, but the text leans on summary (“waited seventeen years,” “studied its properties”) rather than showing a contradictory impulse in-scene. No micro-choice complicates her resolve; the song succeeds the instant she begins, so the promised flaw/fragility never tests her. Earned cost is present—she weeps, the vine revives—yet the absence of a live decision under pressure keeps the arc just shy of high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—Elara’s cold knees, deliberate breath-sync with earth—but the “translate heartbeats into maps” motive is stated more than dramatized in present action; we watch her enact ritual rather than feel a live heartbeat at risk now. No contradictory impulse in scene; the pattern-making proceeds flawlessly, so the final sealing feels inevitable, not costly. Micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, pressing paper) are legible but do not force a trade-off or reveal a fresh flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s peripheral-focus trait is embodied in tactile mirror-work and her refusal to rush the repair; the renunciation of “restoring function” for “redirecting purpose” carries visible cost in the final paragraph. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The lone flaw: no second character means status/relationship bullets are moot, capping her at 8.7 rather than 9+. Still, the earned stasis is credible and scaled to word count.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    The weaver’s interior contradiction—accepting petrifaction for weightlessness—is embodied through micro-choices (threading, orienting) and calcifying fingertips. The arc from overwhelmed arrival to willing dissolution is credible, but the final surrender is forecast so early that the closing beat feels predetermined rather than freshly chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The widow’s interiority is sensuously grounded (rain on glass, wood dust in nostrils) and her micro-choices—ignoring the kettle, pressing glass eyes last—embody the “here/gone” tension. The contradiction between clinging and releasing is dramatized, not declared. Yet the arc is more accumulative image-pattern than causal escalation, so the final “keeping hold / letting go” read as earned stasis rather than a turn that costs her a future path.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—scavenger pragmatism vs. spectral self-negotiation—are dramatized in embodied beats (camera lifts, booted steps on impossible water). The final renunciation lands with felt cost: she accepts “exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace,” foreclosing redemption. Interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic speak (“failure is ordinary”) but stays grounded in concrete sensorium. Ghost-as-status dynamic is cleanly staged, no second character needed.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are declared repeatedly but only once translate into an embodied choice (kneeling to lift the sextant). Interiority drifts into abstract hope-equations; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The council speech is summarized, so the cost of her conviction is off-stage. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—clinging to unfinished grief vs. the need to release it—are rendered through tactile micro-choices (turning the key, watching the bear). Interiority is specific, not therapeutic, and the inherited refusal to finish the clock feels lived-in. The final act of winding lands as credible renunciation with visible cost: the silence is broken, the dream set free. Only the bear’s interior calm is ventriloquized once, a minor POV slip under the lens of Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular—her “smiled with that thoughtfully clear satisfaction” instantiates the required trait in embodied, scene-specific fashion. Motivation (decoding cartographic erasure) stays consistent and escalates to the steering choice toward older brickwork. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page; the moment of internal fracture is told rather than shown (−0.3). The final image of continuing sundial measurement offers a resonant endurance rather than a costly renunciation, keeping the arc just shy of the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s “infinite patience” is shown through tactile micro-choices—coiling rope, pocketing glass—so the trait is more than label. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany (“he understood finally”) is declared, not dramatized with contradictory impulse, so the cost feels announced rather than paid. Still, the renunciation of immediate action for long planting is consistent and stakes a path.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her pocket-touch of the thread, the “profession of farewells”—but the decisive renunciation (“she would stay”) is foreshadowed more than dramatized in scene; the cost is felt yet not fully compounded by prior micro-choices, keeping the turn just shy of full causal burnish.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific (“colder brass railing… nostalgia”), but the prince’s shift from destroyer to integrator is confessed rather than dramatized: “he understood at last” tells the reversal. The egg warms in his hands—nice embodied cue—but no micro-choice on the page actually risks or costs him anything. Still, the contradiction between filial duty and emergent compassion is felt throughout, keeping him above the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is sensuous and specific—black sand against her palm, the copper coin warming like an ember—contradictory impulses (restless vs. healer) stay active in scene. The final stance-crystallization (“chose every single day to be light”) is earned by the chain of micro-choices: kneeling, pressing sand, pocketing the coin, turning back toward the village. Cost is visible: she will keep walking into smoke that smells of her father’s arson. Voice never slides into diagnostic self-talk; grief is shown via bodily ritual, not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira’s phosphorescence and skepticism are vivid, but her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the shift from doubt to resolve is smooth yet cost is only lightly felt. The “earned stasis” lands, but the beats of refusal are narrated summary, not pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vael’s interiority is textured—sonar-ping perception, bodily translucence, gear-weight as legacy—but the emergent “consciousness” of the gear is accepted without visible contradiction or micro-choice that forecloses a path; the final stance is more passive witnessing than earned renunciation, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personally paid. The sentimentalist label is shown, not told, yet the gear’s agency blurs Vael’s decision moment enough to cap the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—wanting to dismiss the “spectral mentorship” yet yielding to its ritual—plays out in embodied micro-choices (leaving tools, unrolling ribbon, speaking the poem aloud). Each action is charged by a visible cost: the admission that her chisels alone can’t carry grief, handing the labor of memory over to hands she once denied. The final renunciation of words in favor of handed-down gesture is earned and irreversible, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s guilt, ritual precision, and the broken-rake confessions are vivid, embodied, and contradictory in the moment of pendulum pause; the final footfall descent proves earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, yet “incremental absolution” is named once in elevated register that slightly leaks diagnostic label. Micro-choices—millimeter adjustments, thirty-seven-second vigil, rake tucked back into coat—tighten value hierarchy and distribute grief weight across years. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interior withstands pressure without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gardener’s gentle competence is sketched through tactile handling of the case and tapestry, but no contradictory impulse presses him; the discovery feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from internal conflict. His “understanding then why he had found this place” is asserted, not dramatized, so the final stance costs him nothing we can see. At this length we don’t need a full arc, yet the beat demands at least one micro-choice that forecloses an option—here the path stays singular and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her “groundedly imaginative” stance is shown through tactile micro-choices (hovering quill, tracing patterns). Yet the absence of any second character keeps relational pressure off-stage, so the only crucible is self-imposed; the final “began to write” is credible but not visibly costly, capping depth at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira’s motivations are clear and consistent—preserving stories, resisting the famine, and choosing the risk of a covert broadcast. Interiority is textural: “turning the scattered papers … into ghosts of their daytime selves,” but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; her stance is steady rather than tested. The micro-choices are all preparatory (adjusting the dial, beginning to sing) rather than a fork that costs her a path. The ending lands as Charged Poise, yet the cost is atmospheric rather than a decision we watch her pay; we infer danger, we don’t feel her relinquish a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—the deliberate smash, the precise ash ritual—yet she never fully exposes contradictory impulses in-scene; the porcelain act feels pre-decided rather than wrestled with. The Renunciation lands (she carries fragments out), but the emotional cost is relayed more as textured description than as a forked choice we watch her survive. Still, her perceptual signature (“charcoal portrait ash scatterer”) threads every beat, keeping her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive to unearth suppressed truth is vivid and embodied; his obsessive cataloguing of silt layers and refusal of “simple history” show a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“I agonize over this evidence because it demands a price” carries both cost and contradiction without label-speak. The choice to keep working alone in the ruins crystallizes an earned stasis that forecloses an easier life on the surface; the price is felt. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page, so the score stops short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Eleanor’s hatred-to-healing arc is embodied in tactile gestures (thumb on rosette) and micro-choices (offering scale to student), but the text still summarizes her turnaround (“hatred had…been unlearned”) rather than dramatizing one irrevocable on-page cost. The student remains a mirror, not a crucible; no reciprocal pressure forces Eleanor to risk anything tangible inside this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s synesthetic tasting of memories is embodied and specific; her refusal to be commodified drives every beat. The final embrace of the seed feels inevitable because her pruning micro-choices (learned from a lost grandmother) keep foreclosing safer paths. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the “gentle rebellion” is lived, not labeled. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s compulsive honesty is the one trait that actually pressures her choices (she can’t soft-pedal the truth to the city), and the moment she admits “they won’t believe me” while holding the riddle shows interior conflict on the page. Mira functions as a catalyst rather than a crucible; the child’s dialogue is too adult and neatly diagnostic (“You preserve wonder in routine”) so relationship pressure reads authored, not earned. The final micro-choice—reading the riddle aloud atop the tower—directly grows from her trait and visibly changes the city’s energy flow, paying the cost of public exposure that her candor makes unavoidable.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s “minute departure” radar is vivid, but she never risks a wrong guess or pays a price for mis-reading; the final recognition feels gifted, not earned. No contradictory impulse unsettles her arc—she observes, catalogs, and is rewarded with epiphany. Interiority is lush yet diagnostically tidy (“she understands finally”) rather than wrestled-with under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Thalassor’s shift from certainty to questioning is vivid, but the interior work is narrated rather than dramatized; no embodied contradiction plays out in a single beat. The diver moment is too brief to test his new stance under pressure, so the cost feels vicarious instead of personal.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maren’s interiority is specific—grim optimism rendered through compulsive dice-rolls and proof-sheets. The chipped/whole dice pair externalizes her fracture/integration, but the “missed opportunity” motive stays abstract; no embodied memory of what, exactly, she lost. Final shift from cage to boundlessness is earned by iterative micro-choices, yet the cost is purely conceptual—no bodily or relational price is felt on the page, keeping her arc just shy of full payment.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s insomnia and “methodically hopeful” trait are embodied through concrete ritual (night climbs, copying symbols). The final creative outburst is prepared by her obsessive pattern-work, so the renunciation of loneliness feels earned. Interiority stays specific: “canvas shoes silent,” fingers “trembling,” etc. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under peak pressure; she slides into epiphany rather than fighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s curator-eye and bread-initial ritual give her a sharp, idiosyncratic interior engine; the final march toward the thaw-entrance is a credible, cost-laden crystallization of that identity. The beekeeper’s absence is felt more than he is dramatized, so relationship pressure is off-page, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Iris’s solitary obsession is vivid—her seventeen-year lighthouse exile, backward clocks, and death-vision flight all ground her motive. Yet the yoyo’s hold on her is asserted more than dramatized; we see no micro-choice that shows the toy altering her hierarchy of values, only summary of weeks “careful analysis.” Interiority is poetic but loops: “unbearable to witness,” “precise and patient,” “bleak exhilaration” repeat instead of revealing new contradiction. The final renunciation lands (she pays with existential erasure), so motivation coheres enough for 7+ but lacks the lived beat-to-beat friction that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s contradictory pull toward oblivion vs. inherited duty is embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the clasp, stepping past the gate, speaking to the mirror). The final renunciation—“she had welcomed the water’s embrace”—is credibly earned by the funhouse confession and costs her the dream-dictionary anchor. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. Slight reserve: the advisor’s disembodied warnings are felt more than Clara’s responses to them, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prophet’s interiority is sensorial, embodied, and consistent; the single on-page choice—striking water in tempo with the wave—crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ gate fails, but the earned smile in darkness signals cost and renunciation of safe silence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s patience and quiet determination are shown through tactile ritual (hand on shell, whistle), but the interior contradiction between “knew better” and continued mapping is asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the final blow-and-glow is motivated but the missing mentor’s single ink dot feels thin as causality for her risk.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is cerebral and consistent—"emotional rationality" is shown, not told—but the piece never lets us feel the grandfather’s betrayal in her body; she remains a filtering intellect rather than a daughter-granddaughter in pain. No micro-choice on site alters her next beat; the decision to publish is declared, not dramatized, so the cost stays conceptual. The flaw is competent but safe; we watch a scholar think about courage instead of witnessing the moment it costs her something.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interior contradiction—scientific detachment vs. pilgrim hunger for lost intention—drives every micro-choice from wading in to sealing notes in cracks. The inkwell discovery crystallizes her shift from observer to “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” a renunciation of mere survey work that costs her professional identity and physical safety. Emotion is embodied in cold water climbing her thighs, flashlight beam trembling; no diagnostic labels intrude. Final stasis on the shore, inkwell against heart, earns the arc: she has accepted perpetual exile from academic neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s tranquil perceptiveness is credibly embodied—her attention to marginalia, the tactile pocketing of the stamp, the candlelit hush—yet the decisive turn (“she would continue the work”) is declared rather than dramatized with a micro-choice that exacts on-page cost. The interior contradiction between bureaucratic obedience and archival rebellion is hinted but never forced into a painful, visible trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s grief is embodied through tactile ritual—polishing, folding, watching the lantern-dream—so the interior engine is vivid. Yet the “luminous torment” tag is repeated instead of freshly enacted in the final beat, blunting the cost. The micro-choice to keep folding another crane does foreclose hope of release, so the renunciation is earned, just not freshly gut-punching.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the geode as ‘sleeping god’ and the urinating-to-survive detail crystallize a believable, guilt-ridden psyche. Contradictory impulses—scientist’s rationalism vs. mystic hope—co-exist live in the final paragraph. Closure cost is felt: the perpetual hunt is accepted with “what else is there to do.” Slight reserve: no micro-choice inside the observatory scene forces a new tactic; stance is static revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s perpetual surprise is more label than embodied contradiction, but her micro-choice to pull the lever is credibly motivated by the “frequency of belonging” ache. The interior arc—realizing she is the missing piece—lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (“already home” forecloses further search). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; solo interiority remains sharp and specific through the climactic mechanism beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maren’s contrition is palpable and embodied (“weight of unspoken words pressed against her ribs”), but the interiority drifts toward self-diagnosis rather than live contradiction in the moment of discovery. The watch-hand beat crystallizes her guilt, yet the decisive renunciation is implied rather than enacted on-page, so the cost is felt but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—"worn smooth by their touch until it fit his palm like a familiar word" shows character-specific perception. The inherited guilt and shared childhood memory create credible contradictory impulses. The final micro-choice—opening the hand to drop the pull—crystallizes a hierarchy of values (release > ritual) with visible cost. Status dynamics are minimal since only two characters share the space, but their mirrored gestures signal equal power in this renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her weathered compass “cold against her thigh” anchors us in her sensory world, while the contradiction between her self-pity and the stubborn flicker of hope feels lived-in. The micro-choice to paddle toward the first utility pole rather than the open sea dramatizes her shift from celestial to land-mark navigation, a credible adaptation that externalizes her broken perception. The cost of her broken stereoscopic vision is repeatedly felt (lopsided strokes, shoreline clinging), and her final laugh is earned because the text has shown her rehearse smaller victories—one pole, one stroke—rather than a sudden epiphany. Only the sister’s off-page phone call feels thin; because Maren never appears, the romantic regret is asserted, not crucible-tested, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s amnesia and the warming baseball give us embodied contradiction; the final “jaded wonder” stance is credibly earned. Yet her choices remain largely interior—walking, noticing, feeling—without a micro-decision that visibly forecloses one path; the empathic shift is declared more than dramatized. Still, the interior layering is character-specific and avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysara’s interiority is lush and embodied—grief hums in her fingertips, fear in her scent-memory—yet the pivot from refusal to readiness is declared (“she was afraid, and she was ready”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The spice-crushing beat shows corporeal agency, earning the metamorphosis, but Korin remains an off-stage memory rather than a relationship under pressure, so the arc is solo-mythic rather than crucible-tested. Still, the contradiction between human fragility and animal hunger is kept alive in every breath, enough to lift the score into the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cartomancer’s guilt-motherhood conflict is viscerally embodied; every beat (pressing inked palm, slicing skin on the cracked saucer) externalizes an internal contradiction. The choice to bleed into the birthday cloth crystallizes her earned renunciation: she forsakes the fantasy of “retrieving lost time” and accepts unrecoverable absence. No other character appears, so relationship/status bullets are NA; solo arc still satisfies. Flaw: “willingly perplexed” is asserted more than dramatized beyond initial ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Seraph’s pacifist coding and grief-anchored interiority are vivid; the contradiction between violence-erased design and the survivor’s guilt is embodied in weight-shift and tear-smell. Micro-choices—floating to spare dust, threading fiber through photographs—externalize values cleanly. The Earned Stasis (refusal to harm while opening the dimension) costs her the last human link; gravity-lightness at the end certifies cost and change.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s interiority is luminous and particular—her noticing of the lightning-bug light “spelling something” shows perception shaped by a life of giving away everything. Yet her choices are largely observational; the only micro-choice on stage is uncorking jars she already decided to carry. The text asserts she “had become” transformation, but this culmination is asserted rather than dramatized through a final, costly act. Interior contradiction is present (destitute yet luminous), but escalation of motive-to-action stays off-stage, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara’s calmly inventive trait is stated repeatedly but only shown in one mechanical beat—rotating the quill to the sundial angles; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies it, so the “inventive” tag feels ornamental rather than lived. Interiority drifts into explanatory summary (“her motivation crystallized”) instead of embodied tension, and the final decision to transmit the revolution is declared, not dramatized with a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid (“second heartbeat” weight) and her micro-choice—expending all star dust for the Spiral—pays the visible cost required. The shift from “promise as burden” to “promise as wing” lands cleanly, though her precognitive curse is more asserted than embodied in moment-to-moment decisions. Grandmother remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Still, the earned renunciation and idiosyncratic perception keep her convincingly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—furious serenity vs. self-silencing—are dramatized in embodied beats (hand on rail, timer in palm, breath-counting). The final renunciation of waiting is earned by the prior causality of storm-stripped pretense and the timer’s metronome of exile. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat drifts toward diagnostic self-label (“cartography of scars”) without immediate embodied cost, clipping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Varn’s interiority is concrete—his mechanical arm’s “response time faster than flesh” shows lived adaptation—and the renunciation of victory for illumination lands with visible cost in the younger scholar’s dropped certainty. The danish card stays pocketed, a restrained micro-choice that keeps hierarchy of values legible. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment carries the beat. Still, the opponent’s desperation is summarized more than dramatized, muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is specific—coffee tin pressed to ribs, moon-cycle condition, trade of poems—yet her dramatic choice (offering one poem to Delphine) is slightly under-motivated; we see no micro-struggle or risk. The monthly personality trait is invoked but not exploited inside this scene, so the on-page contradiction is minimal. Delphine’s pianist past is elegantly embodied in her "quiet precision" and voice, so relationship crucible works. Cost is gestured (privacy surrendered) but not sharpened, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief-soaked ritualism is vivid—winding the clock, decoding film-flicker—but his one active decision (climbing to the arbor) is explained more than dramatized; we feel the ache, yet the final choice to play the encore is more emblematic than earned through visible micro-cost on the page. The interiority is concrete and particular; no label-speak. Still, the absence of a second character keeps the “relationship as crucible” bullet inert, so the arc is solitary endurance rather than relational change.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“weight of her people’s dispersed memories” lands—but she never faces a contradictory impulse in-scene; the dream simply gives her the answer and she accepts. No micro-choice alters her course after the ascent, so the final “trust” feels inherited, not earned. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the embodied cost of carrying memory is kept tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek’s interior contradiction—yearning for Elias while pruning toward acceptance—is embodied in the tactile micro-choice of lifting the compass and shears. The slow-spoken trait is shown through deliberate pacing of action, not label. Cost is legible: he renounces pursuit, accepting permanent absence. Interiority stays concrete, though the “cerulean regret” label edges toward diagnostic speak (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction: her scientific rigor wars with emergent emotional vulnerability, especially in the moment she interprets the butterfly’s dust as a “golden fingerprint.” Her micro-choice to linger and witness—not calculate—reveals a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring insight in tactile detail (scales on skin, light curves on thumb). Her flaw—imposing narrative drama on cosmic processes—is credibly tied to her professional identity and reconfigured through quiet observation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation evolves credibly from survival to understanding, grounded in her identity as a glass artist. Her interiority is embodied (“breath fogging,” “fingertip tracing frost”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The shift from grief to resolve feels earned through repeated micro-choices (studying frost, rereading ledger). However, the final smile verges on unearned uplift without a visible trade-off or sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silent expressiveness, trauma from the Great Quieting, and tactile relationship with the tuning fork case reveal a coherent, flawed character. Her motivation to “translate silence into music” emerges organically from her history and sensory adaptation. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding emotion in thermal mapping and physical gesture. However, her final realization borders on epiphanic without sufficient micro-choice buildup under pressure, slightly undercutting the earnedness of her closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aldric’s interiority is richly embodied—his ache behind the ribs, his stubborn adherence to old embalming methods, and his weary competence feel specific and lived-in. His contradictory impulses (withdrawal vs. duty) act simultaneously when he accepts the souls’ call. The final choice—to wait by the window with renewed purpose—is earned through his prior isolation and professional ethos. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “gently persistent” nature manifests in micro-choices like anonymous food deliveries and handwritten notes. The final act of ringing the bell emerges organically from her grandmother’s legacy and community role, not imposed duty. Her emotional embodiment avoids therapy-speak; grief lives in tactile details (“metal so cold it burned,” “hands trembling but eyes sharp”). The intergenerational handoff between Mariem and Farouk crystallizes her motivation without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, salt-tongued grief, and breath-driven perception ground her motivation in sensory truth. Her contradiction (seeking healing while bearing inherited sorrow) operates simultaneously, not sequentially. The final choice—to translate unused love through the camera obscura—is earned by her established identity as a “pilgrim of sparks.” Minor deduction: the past-life memory arrives with near-instantaneous emotional transfer, slightly compressing the struggle between disbelief and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, curiosity, and professional discipline merge in tactile choices (e.g., tracing hawthorn spirals, drawing in dirt). Her motivation stems from a coherent worldview as a hedge maze designer who sees time as spatial. The final decision to complete the circuit feels earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. No therapy-speak or stock phrasing; her contradictions (desire to preserve vs. acceptance of disintegration) pulse through action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chains are both literal and symbolic, her patience strategic yet costly. Her contradictory impulses (liberator vs. prisoner, urgency vs. caution) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when pressing the piano keys with chained wrists. The final renunciation of immediate planting in favor of future subversion is earned through three years of decoding and underground endurance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (“yellowed horsehair stuffing,” “green scent of dormant potential”).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s synesthetic perception and grief-driven mission are rendered with precise interiority; her micro-choices—forging in the ashen flame, listening to the aurora—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. The motivation is consistent, rooted in embodied trauma rather than abstract longing, and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. Her flaw—believing trust can be engineered like sound—is credible and costly, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses closure with David but affirms her work’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her belief in “moments choosing observers” and her ritualized theft feel character-specific, not thematic scaffolding. Her micro-choices (uncapping the moonbeam jar, observing through the viewfinder) reveal a hierarchy of values: revelation over possession. The man’s weariness is rendered with specificity, but his agency remains passive; he reacts rather than chooses, limiting relational depth. Still, Mira’s final smile earns its quiet poise through consistent motive and cost—the emptied jar, the unspoken exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glassblower’s interiority is richly embodied—his cautious vulnerability, reverence for brokenness, and yearning for inquiry feel specific and lived-in. His micro-choices (e.g., handling the cracked bookmark, transferring glass to the glory hole) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation through transformation, not perfection. However, his internal conflict remains largely reflective rather than enacted under acute pressure; the story avoids a decisive moment where contradictory impulses collide in action. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but the single-POV execution is otherwise masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s phobia and adaptive persona are embodied with visceral specificity—her trembling fingers, film-slicked jacket, and internal contradiction between performed bravery and paralyzing fear feel lived-in. Her micro-choice to trace the smudged notes despite rising panic reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Daniel’s betrayal crystallizes cleanly through status dynamics and prior mentorship, making his shift from guardian to captor legible and pressurized. The final renunciation (“I am not who you made me”) is earned by her decryption act and reframing of vulnerability as strength.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle’s motivation—drawing a map of endless night—is deeply rooted in generational knowledge and personal obsession, compelling her final act with credible endurance. Her interiority is concrete (“weathered hands trembling,” “mildly obsessed heart”) and filtered through sensory memory of pebbles and silence. The story avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through embodied ritual (handling the booklet, charcoal drawing). However, the lack of on-page contradictory impulses—only resolve—limits full 9+ eligibility despite strong Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Unit 7-Kappa’s interiority is rendered with precise, embodied contradiction—curiosity vs. programming, composition vs. recursive doubt—and its final choice to play the violin emerges organically from accumulated timeline fragments. The motivation to seek the origin of thought is dramatized through micro-choices (returning nightly, handling the violin with care) rather than stated. Emotional progression avoids therapy-speak; “feeling” is framed as vibration, not anthropomorphism. The robot’s renunciation of mere maintenance for musical inquiry carries a subtle but felt cost: it abandons functional certainty for existential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira and the registrar are rendered with precise interiority and embodied emotion—Mira’s cautious hope, the registrar’s tactile rituals with the lens and ledger. Their micro-choices (offering tickets, touching hands) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The relationship functions as crucible: their silent exchange reconfigures mutual isolation into fragile connection. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels earned through concrete action rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her pragmatic patience, reverence for loss, and quiet cunning emerge through micro-choices like redirecting investors and polishing marbles. Her contradictions (stubborn yet yielding, deceptive yet honest with the garden) operate simultaneously without therapy-speak. The final refusal to guide the villager reveals a hierarchy of values: trust in the garden’s wisdom over human impatience. Every gesture aligns with motive; no flaw is hedged or sentimentalized.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “mechanically warm fingertips,” tactile relationship with tools, and quiet pride in being an “obliging sky mechanic” ground her motivation in profession and identity. Her micro-choices (gripping the lever, adjusting the nexus) align with her hypothesis and reveal a hierarchy of values: discovery over safety, precision over haste. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion emerges through action (“breath caught in the icy research air”). However, internal contradiction is muted—her certainty borders on unearned, lacking struggle that would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s motivation—deciphering Marco’s posthumous message—is rooted in specific, consistent traits: loyalty, musical intuition, and grief. Her internal conflict (stay vs. flee) is embodied through tactile choices (clutching the cello, wading through water) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation—leaving after completing the “conversation”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons safety to fulfill a ghost’s request. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotions manifest through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fever, guilt, and professional doubt manifest in physical sensation and micro-choices (e.g., touching the smudge only after emotional thaw). Her contradictory impulses—desire for certainty vs. acceptance of error—act simultaneously in scene. The final forecast isn’t redemption but endurance with cost: she carries grief while doing her duty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through auroral light on frost, copper taste, trembling petals.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his skepticism battles the tunnel’s liminal pressure without devolving into diagnostic labels. His final confession emerges from layered contradiction: rational dismissal versus drowsy surrender, isolation versus need to unburden. The micro-choice to speak crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth over secrecy) with palpable cost. No head-hopping or motivational gaps; his arc aligns tightly with the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—to witness without judgment—is consistent and embodied through their loose grip on reality and ritualized movements. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; their choices are acts of repetition, not tension. The final renunciation (enduring as witness) is credible but not tested by a meaningful alternative, weakening the cost. Interiority is poetic but leans toward abstraction over visceral contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her mellow adaptiveness and devotion to preserving wonder—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene. The keepsake functions more as thematic anchor than a driver of micro-choices with visible cost. Maya’s touch is affecting but doesn’t force Elara into a renunciation or decision that forecloses a path. Interiority avoids therapy-speak but leans toward lyrical summation over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—collecting “the stories walls had heard”—is consistent, deeply tied to his perceptive oddness, and intensifies credibly upon discovering Miriam’s diary. His interiority is concrete (“fingers that had learned the language of ash”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice—to continue probing with renewed urgency—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he accepts futility yet persists. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; focus remains tightly on Elias’s embodied perception and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his crumbling fortune wrappers mirror his past microdot work, and his contradictions (espionage vs. prophecy, control vs. surrender) pulse through precise micro-choices. His refusal to open the letter and sealing it with cookie paste is a renunciation charged with visible cost. The final stance—orchestrating then stepping back—feels earned by his consistent pattern of trusting flow over command. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile ritual and weathered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Father Matthias is vividly rendered through concrete contradictions: his clinical detachment warring with spiritual urgency, his reliance on questions over ritual, his artistic discipline fused with theological inquiry. His micro-choices—adjusting the loop pedal, selecting alizarin crimson, walking toward the vestry—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on revelation through interrogation. The absence of Gabriel as an active interlocutor limits relational crucible, but Matthias’s internal conflict (between knowledge and intervention) is sustained and embodied. No diagnostic label-speak; his expertise feels lived, not exposited.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradictions—her temporal disorientation isn’t abstract but felt in sensory overlaps (“ginger and snow becoming the same thing”) and micro-choices (tracing the nautilus, writing the fortune). Her motivation—to grant permission to unheard music—is consistent, rooted in her own ache, and culminates in a credible renunciation: she exhausts herself to deliver one final message. The diagnostic label “temporal displacement syndrome” risks therapy-speak but is immediately grounded by visceral longing, avoiding unearned epiphany. Her final act forecloses her own future with visible cost: dissolution into dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“feet hovering a breath above the ancient stones”) and consistent contradiction—her gravity-defying power is both liberation and prison. Her motivation to “conquer the labyrinth of self” emerges organically from trauma, not exposition. The final choice—to become the one who drops the stone—is earned by her traversal of fractured selves. However, emotional progression leans slightly toward epiphanic clarity over messy irrationality, just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness after deafness—is rendered with visceral specificity, not diagnostic abstraction. Her internal conflict between yearning for sensation and resignation is embodied in micro-choices: placing her palm on the phonograph, winding the crank “as if drawing breath.” Koren exerts quiet pressure through presence rather than dialogue, and Maren’s transformation from passive endurance to active navigation of silence feels earned. The final renunciation of hearing-as-only-path and embrace of vibration-based music carries clear cost and credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s motivation is deeply rooted in her professional identity and moral compass, crystallizing credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict—between solitude and responsibility—is rendered through specific, embodied choices (e.g., lateral evasion, pigeon messaging) rather than abstraction. The final decision to act emerges organically from her established traits, with clear cost: exposure, danger, and the end of her protective isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany is grounded in tactile ritual and prior data.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mirabel’s interiority is richly embodied—her “aromatically cautious” trait, grief, and hesitation feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choice to uncork the vial despite fear reveals a hierarchy of values: understanding over safety. The final acceptance of grief as “the shape of caring” avoids therapy-speak by grounding it in sensory and botanical metaphors. No epiphany feels unearned; every insight arises from tactile interaction with the bloom and vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied: her “ethically playful” nature manifests in tactile choices (tracing spirals, pressing rope to chest) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. Her contradictory impulses—documenting vs. joining the transformation—act simultaneously in the final beat, not as alternating summaries. The prison backstory is anchored in present sensation (the rope’s fibers), and her micro-choice to redraw the pattern crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: remaining human enough to witness, yet never fully belonging. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion emerges through concrete perception (“starlight pulsed with a rhythm she had learned to recognize”).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s motivation—rooted in intergenerational trauma and artistic duty—is embodied through tactile choices (holding the bowl, playing into silence) rather than abstract longing. Her internal conflict between grief and hope manifests simultaneously in raw, searching notes and the tenderness with which she handles heirlooms. The final renunciation isn’t of music but of despair, earned by prior causality: her grandmother’s storytelling tradition directly informs her method of unbinding. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in ash-coated branches and vibrating brass.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her “affectionate detachment” and professional rigor manifest in micro-choices (testing the compound on herself first, reading static as emotional residue) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her contradictions (craftsman vs. empath, faker vs. truth-seeker) operate simultaneously, not as alternating states. The grief she experiences is embodied through scent and sensation, not diagnostic labels. Her final insight—that her half-truths are “whole lies” yet necessary—feels earned by the visceral transformation she undergoes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile memory of her grandmother, her ritual of drawing lighthouses, and her tension between professional detachment and emotional curiosity feel authentic and consistent. Elias’s wariness and quiet dignity are revealed through precise micro-behaviors (trembling hands, lamplight correction). Their mutual recognition of “invisible hands” emerges from character-specific worldviews, not exposition. The final choice—to carry forward the annotated program and locket reproduction—is earned by prior causality and carries a subtle but felt cost: the burden and privilege of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yara’s internal contradiction—between her “boldly sympathetic” past and her yearning for reciprocal belonging—is embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, offering reeds) and crystallizes in her decision to stay. Her flaw isn’t abstract; it’s dramatized through failed village interactions and the arbor’s reflection. The final micro-choice—to ask what shapes the community needs—reverses her old pattern with visible cost: surrendering the savior role. No diagnostic label-speak mars the epiphany; insight arises from sensory confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sera’s motivation is rooted in her role as a witness to vanishing life, and her internal conflict—between duty and dread—is embodied through tactile details (the pendant’s edges, the stuttering water). Her micro-choices (packing specific tools, steering toward the chamber) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over safety. The final act of borrowing time is earned by her grandmother’s legacy and prior observation, with visible cost implied in the weight of responsibility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The conjurer’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her “ambiguous loss” manifests not as abstract yearning but as embodied friction between retained magic and severed connection. Her micro-choices (pressing glass eyes to her own, leaving them on the mosaic) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over possession, pattern over resolution. The final dovetailing with grief—not solving it—feels earned through consistent, gently inventive behavior. No diagnostic label-speak mars her emotional calculus; even “mathematics of emotion” is dramatized through tactile instruments and spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her kindness and methodical nature manifest through micro-choices (e.g., cradling the tape fragment “with reverence”) rather than labels. Her motivation—to be present for the unseen—is dramatized through consistent action, not declaration. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her emotional truth emerges via tactile engagement with infrastructure. Her final smile carries quiet cost: visibility achieved only through transmission, never recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, the linden leaf as a tactile proxy for her resistance, and the circuitous dialogue with Sarah all reveal contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness. Her final call to Sarah demonstrates a micro-choice that costs her emotional control but aligns with her dawning acceptance. The transformation feels earned because her professional identity (plant scientist) and personal paralysis are fused from the first paragraph. No safety-hedging: she remains stubbornly flawed even in surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s insomnia, painterly perception, and desperate need for meaning are embodied with visceral specificity—her trembling hands, double vision, and "sleepless colors" reveal a psyche fraying under pressure. The stranger’s "wry and weary" presence applies immediate, credible pressure without over-explaining. Motivation is clear: the brooch-for-telescope exchange is a survival calculus rooted in post-war scarcity. However, the final choice to sleep feels slightly unearned; her nineteen-day vigil collapses too cleanly without a micro-struggle that would crystallize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Varen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—pride vs. humility, certainty vs. doubt—and his micro-choices (gathering pearls, moving deeper) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw (overreliance on vision) directly causes the first crack in his certainty, and the transformation feels earned. However, the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle, softening the cost. The pilgrim’s off-page presence limits interpersonal crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s motivation—compiling fragments into meaning—is embodied through tactile interaction with relics and consistent micro-choices (e.g., checking the satchel, inviting Sera). His internal contradiction (staying behind vs. yearning for connection) manifests in quiet gestures rather than exposition. The vision mechanic avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring epiphanies in sensory detail (salt crystals, brass valve). Final renunciation of passive waiting is earned: he closes his hand around the valve not as resolution but as commitment, with cost implied in years of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “trembling certainty,” the tension between analytical precision and artistic interpretation, and her fear of loss feel authentic and specific. Her final confession emerges credibly from established traits, not therapy-speak. The micro-choice to speak aloud feels earned by prior emotional buildup. However, the mentor’s absence limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is precise, embodied, and consistently filtered through her scientific skepticism—evident in her “cramped and precise” journaling and tactile engagement with the tile. Her transformation from observer to participant feels earned: the memory cascade triggered by transcription isn’t epiphanic but sensory, rooted in physical contact (“pressed her palm to the same cool stone”). The final choice—to add her voice to the chorus—emerges from accumulated pressure, not convenience, and retains her core trait (skepticism) while integrating wonder. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional shifts are conveyed through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied weariness and precise contradictions—boredom coexisting with relentless searching, omnipotence shadowed by longing. His final realization avoids diagnostic label-speak and emerges from sensory immersion in the storm and amulet’s pulse. The micro-choice to raise the amulet crystallizes his hierarchy of values: truth over immortality’s comfort. However, the absence of any external character or relational pressure limits the crucible dimension expected at elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is precise and contradictory—her honesty wars with inherited cunning, and her moral calculus evolves under pressure without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (e.g., writing Darius’s story as proof, not petition) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking her professional integrity to uphold ethical clarity. The father’s legacy isn’t just backstory—it actively shapes her present struggle to define fairness. Her transformation feels earned because it emerges from sustained tension between who she was taught to be and who she chooses to become.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her grandmother’s legacy and her belief in silence as a vessel of memory. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile interactions with lamp, notepad, and prism—and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The story shows contradictory impulses: she endures isolation yet actively seeks connection across time. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and her final choice (continued listening) lacks a decisive renunciation with visible cost beyond implied solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nameless protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices—e.g., tucking the label into a pocket among other fragments—revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in survival, not sentiment. Motivation stems from consistent traits: anonymity as both wound and shield, listening as resistance. The final renunciation (choosing to remain unnamed rather than erased) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through rust, tides, and paper texture.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is richly embodied—her “gloomy cheerfulness” and professional rigor clash with visceral tremors upon touching the cello, revealing layered contradictions. Her micro-choices (repeatedly engaging the strings despite dread) expose a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, connection over control. The flaw is minor but telling: her epiphany about “things left unsaid” edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, slightly undercutting the rawness expected in peak crisis. Still, her renunciation of debunking feels earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “orderly intuitive rhythm” manifests in cataloging faces and mapping displacement, not abstract self-diagnosis. Her dual allegiance generates authentic tension: she accepts change but fights for terms, refusing naive resistance. The foundation stone chip grounds her emotion physically, and her micro-choices (painting specific symbols in precise locations) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No therapy-speak or epiphanies; her hope is earned through action, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s “professionally obsessive” curiosity drives every micro-choice—from double-checking the chemical chamber to timing her exposure—and her interiority is concretely rendered through tactile ritual and embodied memory. The grain of sand and Yusuf’s legacy anchor her motivation without sentimentality, and her final endurance (“she would outlast this moment”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: bearing witness over preservation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action (adjusting lenses, pocketed warmth) under pressure. Her flaw—obsessive documentation as both calling and coping—complicates but doesn’t resolve the loss, making her Earned Stasis deeply credible.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s blindness is not a deficit but a reconfigured mode of perception, deeply integrated into his artisan identity and repair method. His motivation—to decode confusion into direction—is embodied in tactile, sensory choices (e.g., reading circuit damage through water-refracted light), revealing a hierarchy of values: care over speed, connection over function. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; his emotional state emerges through action (“dipped his fingers,” “listened to the quiet hum”) rather than internal monologue. Final release of the drone carries quiet cost—his enduring solitude—as he returns to the bench, foreclosing personal departure for service.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Miriam’s motivation—to locate a mythic hydrographic convergence—is rooted in her professional identity and personal obsession, compelling credible risk and endurance. Her interiority is concrete (“learned to read these patterns,” “subtle confidence”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final Charged Poise—proof in hand, silence before discovery—earns its cost through prior isolation and scholarly dismissal. No secondary characters dilute focus; micro-choices (sending the falcon, interpreting condensation) reveal a hierarchy of epistemic values.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eliorn’s motivation is deeply rooted in a metaphysical understanding of communal resonance, not sentimentality, and her actions—naming buildings, walking circuits, using the fork—are consistent extensions of her worldview. Her patience isn’t passive; it’s tactical endurance with visible cost (aching legs, warm fork). The story avoids diagnostic interiority, instead embodying emotion through tactile ritual (“pressed against her sternum like a second heartbeat”). Her final smile carries earned poise, not triumph, satisfying Earned Stasis with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her burning lungs, desperate exhalation, and instinctive hesitation feel urgent and specific. Her contradictory impulses (survival vs. duty) act simultaneously in-scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—surrendering singular existence to become a vessel—is earned through consistent familial legacy and escalating physical stakes. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and irreversible micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is deeply rooted in inherited shame and the desire to restore narrative justice, not personal vindication. His internal conflict—between silence and testimony—is embodied in tactile choices (carrying the lattice, kneeling where his father knelt) rather than abstract reflection. The final act of speaking aloud transforms passive grief into active witness, with visible cost: he accepts permanent exile as the keeper of an unwanted truth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete ritual and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her spectral fragility versus her active stewardship of the debt—are embodied in precise, tactile gestures (e.g., clutching the bead, pressing it to glass). Her motivation is rooted in a centuries-old pact, and her final renunciation (nearly finished work) carries visible cost: she remains bound until the last scion awakens. The gardener’s parallel grief/joy mirrors Elara’s own duality, deepening interiority without exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through alchemical metaphor made visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her wharf-weaver heritage and belief in reweaving broken traditions—and intensifies through her nightly stitching. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying hope through tactile action (“strands of intention woven from her unshakeable hope”). The final act of sewing the spring’s rim earns her “orchid solace” as a credible emotional payoff, not an epiphany. However, the lack of active contradiction (e.g., doubt vs. faith) in-scene prevents full 9+ status.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in ancestral silence and interrupted return—is compellingly embodied through tactile actions (brushing debris, placing the gnomon) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety, restoration over departure. Her “warmly curious” fatigue never softens into sentimentality; contradictions surface in her simultaneous reverence and urgency. The final act of reassembly feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in lost time, isolation, and emotional exposure. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “carefully inventive hope,” tactile rituals with chalk and clipboard, and emotional investment in surface mail reveal a coherent, flawed psyche. Her motivation (to restore meaning through marginalia) directly fuels her creation of “Vesper Lane” and the postscript, which crystallizes her worldview. The contradiction between her belief in tangible connection and the world’s digital erasure generates authentic tension without therapy-speak. Final choice (adding the PS) is earned by prior behavior and carries conceptual cost: surrendering the letter to an indifferent system.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her needle, flame, and charts function as extensions of her cognition under pressure. Her wisdom-as-foolishness disguise informs micro-choices (e.g., the “small smile” that disarms suspicion) with clear cost: isolation, constant vigilance. Motivation is consistent and intensifies believably as the coup nears. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions emerge through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her trembling hand, the shard’s warmth, the unsent letter as a “monument to her cowardice.” Her micro-choices (pressing the window, holding up the shard) reveal a hierarchy of values: love beneath fear, self-punishment beneath longing. The final act of standing in the liminal space integrates both selves without false resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity feels earned and human.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “shrewdly innocent” nature manifests in micro-choices (e.g., translating Fatima’s trauma with tenderness rather than detachment) and contradictory impulses (hope vs. exhaustion). Her motivation—to witness through translation—is rooted in lived experience, not abstraction. The child’s silent touch crystallizes Elira’s agency without overstatement. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic self-awareness while conveying complex emotional residue from war.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—rediscovering joy after creative depletion—is consistent, embodied, and drives her return to the orchard. Her internal conflict between hollow efficiency and authentic creation manifests in tangible choices (e.g., using the fresco fragment, projecting light). The emotional shift is earned through sensory engagement and communal witness, not epiphany. However, the lack of a second on-page character with active pressure limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her methodical playfulness, her tactile engagement with pigment and echo, and her dawning epiphany feel earned, not diagnostic. Her shift from restoration-as-recovery to restoration-as-conversation emerges through micro-choices (timing brushstrokes to echoes, pocketing the nickel) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The flaw is minor: the transition into “bewitch” borders on abstraction, though it’s swiftly grounded by sensory detail. No head-hopping; single POV is controlled and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scholar’s misbuttoned coat, whispered thoughts, and tactile reverence for the seed reveal a mind under siege. Her contradictions (charm vs. secrecy, defiance vs. caution) manifest in micro-choices like smiling at the drone while planting rebellion. Motivation stems organically from her identity as a “rogue scholar” who has risked interrogation for unstructured thought. The final act of planting feels earned, with visible emotional cost in her tenderness toward the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied longing and contradiction—she both endures and creates, sings to herself while sending poems away. However, her “centuries” of insomnia verge on abstraction without concrete markers of lived time, slightly diluting motivation. The final acceleration (“She writes faster”) feels reactive rather than driven by a newly sharpened choice. Her agency is poetic but passive; she waits, rather than decides.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass-orchid caretaker embodies interior contradiction through embodied emotion—foxglove regret as “love for things that could not be recovered coupled with fierce determination”—without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (e.g., lifting the wind chime to glass, not ear) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: preservation implies irrevocable loss. Motivation intensifies consistently through pressure of extinction, and her endurance constitutes Earned Stasis. No secondary characters dilute focus; single-POV interiority remains concrete, specific, and flawlessly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, heartbeat of hesitation, and “carefully reckless” approach reveal layered contradiction without diagnostic labels. Her motivation (to finish their work, restore trust) intensifies under pressure and culminates in a choice that reconfigures her relationship with Elian. The final micro-choice—to write despite risk—carries visible emotional cost and fulfills a promise rooted in consistent character traits. Elian’s presence deepens the crucible, and his wet eyes confirm mutual transformation earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in her identity as a machinist and daughter, with interiority rendered through precise, embodied observation (“trembling fingers collected samples”) rather than exposition. Her final choice—to continue her father’s work—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of accepting danger and grief. Contradictory impulses (love vs. duty, safety vs. legacy) act simultaneously in scene, especially when analyzing the adhesive. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness, grounding emotion in tactile detail and professional ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eleanor’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, patience, and professional history as a pigeon handler shape every micro-choice without diagnostic self-awareness. Contradictory impulses (longing for messages vs. fear of silence) act simultaneously in her dust-mote mapping and meteorite work. The final choice to believe in response isn’t epiphanic but earned through incremental acts of attention. Her flaws (withdrawal, aversion to risk) directly complicate her healing and are accepted with visible cost: the silent aviary, the unsold inventory.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile perception and metaphor, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices—kneeling to read the grain, stepping off the terrace—are grounded in her mother’s teachings and her own evolving understanding. The final decision to cross the threshold feels earned, with emotional cost implied in the “necessary distance” now collapsed. However, the mother’s presence remains slightly archetypal, limiting full relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s interiority is richly embodied—his grandmother’s feather, the inherited question of belonging, and his tactile navigation of the facility reveal a character shaped by legacy and longing. His micro-choices (activating the lock, placing the feather beside the amber) carry emotional weight without over-explanation. The absence of other on-page characters limits relational crucible, but the single-POV execution is precise. His final realization avoids epiphany cliché by grounding insight in shared witnessing rather than solitary revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is richly embodied—her “love of the space between knowing and imagining” feels authentic and specific. The fisher’s grief is rendered with restraint, his trembling hands and unspoken void conveying emotional weight without melodrama. Both characters’ choices stem from consistent traits: Maren’s patience and interpretive humility, the father’s desperate hope masked as practicality. However, the son remains a reconstructed phantom, limiting reciprocal relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “analyst’s smile,” his tactile handling of the bishop, and his rejection of luck in favor of orchestrated chance reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche. His micro-choices (e.g., timing performances between acts, directing rather than catching the bishop) reflect a hierarchy of values: control over chaos, artistry over spectacle. Yet his motivation remains static; no path is foreclosed, no cost visibly paid beyond the implied exhaustion of repetition. The lack of a decisive renunciation or transformation prevents full closure alignment, though his endurance is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tide dancer’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her exile, memory, and transformation are rendered through sensory contradiction (“salt of her former world would evaporate into memory,” “anchor within her dissolve like salt in rain”). Her micro-choices (breathing on the moonstone, pressing fingers to skin) reveal a hierarchy of values: art over nostalgia, presence over return. The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost (abandoning tides, identity) and no diagnostic label-speak. Her flaw—attachment to rhythm—is confronted through action, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glazier’s interiority is richly embodied through her tactile relationship with glass, water, and light; her contradictions—solitude versus service, mysticism versus craft—are rendered without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (selecting the stone, watching ripples, turning toward work) reveal a hierarchy of values: patience, perception, quiet repair. The only limitation is that her motivation remains slightly abstracted in the final paragraph (“to illuminate value in the mundane”) rather than dramatized through a specific, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and morally complex—her scars, the box, and her vocation intertwine to reveal a character forged by loss yet actively choosing tenderness. Her micro-choices (carrying the box, speaking for Elena, returning annually) reflect a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The contradiction between her hardened competence and enduring grief operates simultaneously, not as alternating moods. No diagnostic label-speak; her emotional calibration feels earned through specific, tactile memory.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her hybrid identity as a “logical dreamer,” and her motivation—to puzzle out equations for hope—is consistent and compelling. However, her choices lack tangible stakes or irreversible consequences; she observes across timelines but never faces a decisive dilemma that forces her to sacrifice one path for another. The absence of embodied contradiction (e.g., fear vs. curiosity, doubt vs. faith) reduces emotional friction, making her endurance feel serene rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sensitively perceptive eye,” the “crackle of centuries in her fingers”—and her micro-choices (retrieving diaries, using negatives) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation over personal safety. Her motivation stems from inherited duty, not abstraction, and her final act of sketching amid ivy rustle shows credible endurance with emotional cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and professional ritual. Her contradiction—loneliness versus communion with ghosts—is active in scene, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and consistent traits—her calm, grace, and centuries-long patience shape every micro-choice. The borrowed heartbeat grounds her metaphysical existence in visceral rhythm, and her motivation to awaken mirrors with possibility feels earned. However, her internal conflict remains latent rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulses actively wrestling in-scene, only a serene execution of purpose. This limits emotional complexity, though her renunciation of permanence (existing as mirage) carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her “operatively gentle” demeanor masks deep grief and strategic resolve, embodied in her trembling pause and ritualized reading of names. Her micro-choices (e.g., opening the clipboard to the dead rather than proposing terms) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on witness over victory. Secondary characters are vividly pressured into revealing their own losses, transforming static enmity into fragile reciprocity. The final handshake isn’t forgiveness but a credible, costly step earned by Maren’s consistent methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s moral ambiguity, internal contradiction (“amoral philanthropist” who is “secretly sentimental”), and embodied sacrifice (trembling hands, abandoned marriage) are rendered with precision. Her motivation—rooted in witnessing the last bird’s death—fuels every micro-choice, from manipulating droughts to walking away without looking back. The final renunciation (Earned Stasis) carries visible cost: isolation, ethical compromise, and surrender of control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“veins could be seen within”) and action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtesan’s internal contradiction—between performance and defiance—is embodied in precise physical gestures (“wrists turned in ways that meant ‘I refuse’”) and sustained through micro-choices (kneeling, untangling). Her motivation is consistent and intensifies via the echo-harvesting ritual, which deepens her resolve. However, the absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible testing, and her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“she was awake”) without the grit of struggle. Still, her renunciation of conformity feels earned through accumulated quiet acts.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s internal contradiction—between artistic precision and ethical evasion—is embodied in his physical hesitation and the tactile handling of the story stick. His epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by emerging through ritual action, not abstract self-analysis. The cost of his prior storytelling is felt in Mira’s absence and the stick’s lingering vibration. Final renunciation (leaving the stick) forecloses his old method with visible symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories through ephemeral acts—is embodied in every micro-choice, from knotting vines to using the moth wing as a template. Her internal contradiction (desire for permanence vs. acceptance of transience) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—rebuilding tomorrow despite possible futility—is earned by forty years of practice and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through tactile precision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her guilt, grief, and technical precision fuse into a coherent, embodied psychology. Her micro-choices (e.g., reconfiguring the rope rather than replacing it) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in preservation over erasure. The final renunciation of isolation is earned through five winters of struggle, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile action and constrained perception.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foresight’s interiority is vividly embodied—her pulse-sync with the bunker, the shifting symbols on the wafer seal—but her final transcendence lacks micro-choice buildup; it arrives as revelation, not decision. Her motivation (to answer inherited questions) is consistent, yet the climactic “understanding” feels epiphanic rather than earned through contradiction or struggle. The grandmother’s influence grounds her emotional cartography, but Foresight herself remains reactive until the end. Still, her sensory engagement and dream-rooted logic create a compelling, specific subjectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maruk’s frugality, empirical rigor, and quiet devotion cohere into a vivid interiority that drives every choice. His contradiction—skepticism versus inherited faith—is embodied in his candlelit transcription and climactic incantation. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) carries visible cost: he renews a covenant abandoned by generations, bearing its weight alone. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion surfaces through tactile detail (“trembling hands,” “frugal nature finding grim satisfaction”).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s pacifism and scheming coexist in credible tension, embodied through her refusal to act violently while orchestrating emotional confrontation. Kael’s resentment is not caricatured but rooted in specific grievance (“They favored you”), and his trembling hands signal internal fracture without therapy-speak. The final choice—releasing resentment to restore the pin—is earned by prior causality: Mira’s appeal to cellular memory ties directly to their shared past with the music box. Cost is felt in Kael’s whispered “Yes… For always,” a surrender that reconfigures his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—her certainty in half-light, her breath-synced craft, her patience rooted in decades of fog-bound work. Her motivation to “capture what the astronomer had chased” emerges from a coherent worldview where mirrors are membranes, not surfaces. The final Charged Poise—mounting the mirror and seeing glass mountains instead of herself—feels earned by her consistent renunciation of vanity in favor of threshold-work. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in rhythm, breath, and tactile labor.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s feisty pride and maternal guilt are embodied in concrete actions—handling the ribbon, using her father’s tools—and drive her flawed but credible return. Her internal contradiction (stubborn self-reliance vs. need for connection) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to tie the ribbon is earned by prior causality, with visible relational cost. However, the daughter’s presence at the end leans slightly on coincidence without showing Mira’s active role in enabling reconciliation, softening the full impact of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her bewilderment, inherited burden, and dawning courage feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choice to ask the pivotal question in the bathroom reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over safety. The nonlinear inheritance creates genuine internal conflict without tidy resolution. However, her final shift leans slightly toward epiphany rather than fully dramatized struggle, keeping it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her scholarly identity and personal history with forgotten languages, and her internal conflict—between preservation and surrender—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., pressing the diary to her chest, translating specimens into “a vocabulary of loss”). Her realization that the mission is about rescuing humanity from its fear of understanding feels earned, though the final renunciation lacks a visible micro-choice that concretely forecloses an alternative path. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but interiority remains consistent and specific. A hairline slip: the shift from “inadequate methods” to sudden competence in “thinking in absences” lacks a dramatized pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “curse of blissful aberration” reflects genuine struggle, not diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choice to step into the fog while pressing the emerald card reveals a hierarchy of values: pursuit of her brother over safety. However, the chimera twin concept remains slightly abstract; the shared consciousness isn’t dramatized through distinct, simultaneous impulses in-scene, only summarized. The final renunciation (accepting trapped freedom) is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in her tactile engagement with the wax seal and rope. Her “warmly methodical” nature isn’t just stated—it shapes micro-choices like climbing the ladder and braiding the rope with deliberate care. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from curiosity to certainty without meaningful hesitation or doubt under pressure. The absence of struggle slightly flattens the emotional stakes despite strong embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is rooted in decades of embodied practice and communal responsibility, not abstract desire. Her internal conflict—between exhaustion and duty, sensory overload and trained perception—is rendered through tactile, specific choices (e.g., stealing the shrine stone, tracing ice cracks). The final act of “inviting” rather than forcing the bloom reveals a hierarchy of values: harmony over control, patience over force. No diagnostic label-speak; her transformation is earned through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s retrocognitive gift and custodial devotion are vividly embodied, not merely labeled, and her final decision to climb the tower emerges credibly from accumulated micro-choices. Her internal conflict—between memory and hope, duty and risk—is rendered through sensory detail and action (e.g., kneeling to uncover the prism, feeling the pavilion’s hum). However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and her flaw remains abstract rather than concretely obstructive. The ending’s Charged Poise is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional ache.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and profession-specific cognition, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her “preemptive nostalgia” functions as a method, not a tic, and her final act of recording emerges credibly from her established worldview. However, the absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible testing, and her choice to write feels inevitable rather than contested—cost is implied but not dramatized as a trade-off. The story leans into Earned Stasis without showing the refusal of an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grandmother’s rag knot, the counting chant, and her belief in “controlled combustion” as resurrection reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche: part ritualist, part rebel. Her micro-choices (kneeling before the mosaic, preparing the spiral with ancestral precision) align with deep-seated motives, and her final act carries the cost of solitary faith in a world that has forgotten how to look up. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail and restrained action. The only flaw: slight over-reliance on inherited wisdom without visible internal friction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with the jade cicada, her observational discipline, and her emotional restraint all feel character-specific. Her micro-choice to place the cicada between them crystallizes a hierarchy of values: reconciliation over pride. The sister’s presence exerts credible pressure, though her interiority remains underexplored, limiting full crucible dynamics. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (warm observation vs. emotional withdrawal) operate simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her simultaneous yearning for and fear of openness pulses in every gesture. Her micro-choices (climbing the inverted doorway, placing then reclaiming the doll) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The father remains off-page but exerts pressure through her calibrated reactions, avoiding exposition while grounding her conflict in lived history. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; epiphanies emerge from tactile experience, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “fluidly logical” mind manifests in micro-choices (extending the route, matching the train whistle’s frequency) that carry emotional and thematic weight. The boy’s silent presence functions as a crucible, forcing Maren to act without dialogue or overt conflict, yet her motivation and contradictions feel lived-in. Her competence is balanced by the vulnerability of inherited duty, and her final renunciation of recognition (“he would not remember…”) carries quiet cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through precise sensory calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “wisely adventurous” nature is embodied through precise actions—peeling paint layers, resisting haste—and her internal contradiction (scholar vs. candidate) emerges organically. The ruby flake’s resonance and her forty-year quest ground motivation in consistent traits. However, the shift from observer to “candidate” leans slightly on revelation rather than prior micro-choices under pressure, softening the causality of her transformation. No emotional flatness or diagnostic phrasing mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tender shadow keeper’s internal conflict—between self-preservation and suffocating isolation—is rendered with embodied specificity, not diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (selecting charred timbers, holding the doorknocker) reveal a hierarchy of values: control over connection, yet yearning for thresholds. The confrontation with her former self crystallizes this contradiction without tidy resolution, and the final step through the door carries visible cost—abandoning the illusion of safety. No therapy-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail and spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trauma, skepticism, and reluctant hope manifest in tactile choices (clutching the bolt, walking toward risk). The “virtuously mischievous” trait drives her agency without over-explaining. Her confrontation with another self crystallizes her arc: not redemption, but witness as transformation. The final tears feel earned, not sentimental, because they emerge from sensory overload (“copper,” “static”) rather than therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her rejection of bloodlines clashes with her visceral pull toward the house. Her micro-choices (approaching the locked room, turning the crank) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over self-protection. However, the final revelation arrives without prior dramatization of her intuitive capacity, making the “bridge of intuition” feel slightly unearned. The grandmother’s voice emerges as exposition rather than character-driven discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s interiority is richly embodied—his calloused fingers remembering “gentler work,” his withdrawal rooted in guilt, and his final shift from isolation to connection feel earned. His contradictory impulses (desire for silence vs. yearning for meaning) act simultaneously in scene. The transformation avoids epiphany, emerging instead through tactile engagement with the marionettes. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, professional restraint, and moral clarity coalesce in micro-choices like handling the button with reverence. Her motivation (“to magnify small kindnesses”) is dramatized through action, not declared. The contradiction between her desire to preserve and her inability to intervene feels authentic and sustained. Final documentation choice earns closure with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “carefully resourceful” trait manifests in micro-choices (hiding documents, reading puddle maps) under pressure. Her motivation stems from generational resistance, not abstract idealism, and her final descent embodies Earned Stasis with visible cost: eleven years of invisibility traded for active dissemination. The grandmother’s legacy isn’t exposition but a lived constraint shaping tactics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in mineral-warm water, worn keys, and starlit codes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The saxophonist’s motivation is clear and rooted in generational duty, with embodied emotion (e.g., “breath coming in ragged hushes”) and micro-choices (shattering a prophetic fragment with three sharp notes) that reveal his hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is subtle but present—his near-memory of the prophecy suggests temptation beneath vigilance. However, the character remains slightly archetypal; his interiority leans on poetic abstraction rather than idiosyncratic thought, limiting full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seraphina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile rituals, emotional restraint, and quiet awe feel character-specific. Her motivation (decoding ancestral messages) is consistent and intensifies credibly when the prophecy arrives. The transformation she undergoes is earned through decades of meticulous attention, not epiphany. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from duty to revelation without palpable resistance or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren’s “uncertainly certain” nature manifests in concrete contradictions: meticulous planning paired with acceptance of cosmic chaos, embodied in her tinkerer’s hands and unresolved grief. Her motivation—refusing bureaucratic closure for Elias—is consistent and intensifies through action (searching archives, following a vague letter). Emotions are grounded (“boots crunching on decades of decay”) rather than abstracted, and her flaw (inability to accept loss) directly fuels her pursuit. The story earns its emotional weight without over-explaining, though the brother’s absence limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is precise and embodied—her regret manifests through tactile interactions with the coin and forge, not diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (dismissing her brother vs. longing to understand him) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in a micro-choice (using kintsugi) that reconfigures her values. The final renunciation of “safe discoveries” is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; all insight arises from dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in personal loss and a belief that joy heals even in parting—is embodied through micro-choices (researching the soldier’s past, adjusting the harp) and consistent interiority. Her “modest fearlessness” isn’t bravado but exhaustion, credibly shaping her actions. The soldier’s arc is secondary but serves as a crucible for Mira’s enduring stance, not a tidy redemption. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and hope are rendered through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her shame lives in her stomach, not her mind; her proprioception is both gift and curse. Her micro-choice to keep the humming mask strap reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, reckoning over escape. The contradiction between her desire for mercy’s mathematics and her complicity under torture fuels credible self-loathing without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (not removing the strap) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied, with contradictions woven into tactile perception (“elusively tangible”) and micro-choices (carrying the fragment for seventeen years, then finally wearing it). Their motivation—initially misread as preservation, revealed as preparation—feels earned through consistent behavior and a pivotal reorientation at the climax. The grandmother’s legacy functions not as exposition but as emotional DNA, shaping the narrator’s arc without over-explanation. No diagnostic label-speak mars the epiphany; the realization emerges through sensory and symbolic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “weightless burden” of perceiving echoes feels specific, not diagnostic. His observational skill drives micro-choices (crouching to read dust patterns, avoiding direct gaze at the presence) that reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over fear, duty over self-preservation. The mainspring barrel triggers his final decision without melodrama, and his competence is balanced by genuine vulnerability (e.g., peripheral vision as protective measure). No head-hopping or stock phrasing; his profession informs perception without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate the incompressible into tangible form—is rooted in her identity as the last letterpress operator, and her micro-choices (tracing frost, using the press) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she sacrifices containment for release. Her interiority is concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “frost’s syntax”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final act of printing embodies earned renunciation: she accepts that some eternities must be opened, not held—a stance forged through consistent, embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vespera’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief smoothed like stone, her revolutionary past refracted through present ritual. Her micro-choices (covering mirrors, touching the shard) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over proclamation, multiplicity over dogma. The contradiction between her poetic idealism and pragmatic temporal mechanics feels lived, not theoretical. Final renunciation—accepting ambiguity as civilizational strength—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of abandoned certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassian’s interiority is richly embodied—his hands, breath, and bone-deep memory of songs convey motive without exposition. His micro-choices (narrating work aloud, pressing the watch to his ear) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma and covenant. The final act of tethering moonlight emerges organically from decades of quiet endurance, not sudden epiphany. Cost is felt in every gesture: the light isn’t fully reclaimed, only partially sung back into being.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—collecting thresholds of transformation—is embodied through precise sensory choices and micro-decisions (e.g., refusing to sell the factory petrichor). Her “sensibly eccentric” trait manifests in credible restraint, not quirk.

Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions arise through tactile perception (“warm metal,” “resonant hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her tactile relationship with driftwood, her calm under storm pressure, and her epiphany at the archway feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her artistic identity and grandmother’s legacy, and her internal conflict—between curiosity and futility—is rendered through embodied perception (“color consumed her canvases,” “quiet courage of blooming unseen”). Her final choice to paint anew is earned by prior obsession and the cathedral window revelation. However, the epiphany arrives without a visible struggle or misstep—her path is linear, lacking contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miriam’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, archival discipline, and ancestral burden converge in tactile choices (pressing diary to chest, tracing debris). Her motivation stems from consistent traits: a truth-seeker shaped by civil rights documentation, now confronting personal erasure. The final confrontation with her grandmother’s apparition crystallizes her role as witness, not solver—an Earned Stasis that forecloses private closure for public remembrance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through salt-grain memory and silent action.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s rejection of false comfort and his choice to build from memory—not magic—manifest in concrete, embodied decisions: kneeling in wet sand, pressing the bottle into earth, recalling specific artisans. His internal contradiction (guardian vs. creator) resolves through action, not epiphany. The final smile feels earned, not sentimental, because it follows tangible labor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Seraphine’s interiority is richly embodied—her pressure behind the eyes, her tactile handling of the wax shaving—and her motivation (to hear the dead’s promises) emerges organically from her role and lineage. Her micro-choice to press the wax to her temple crystallizes her hierarchy of values: memory over silence, legacy over obsolescence. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; she smiles with “velvet disquiet,” not triumph. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “furiously tranquil” paradox manifests in concrete micro-choices (clutching the acorn cap, stilling her mind) under escalating pressure.

    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “credibly curious” touch of the bell rope, her reverence for silence, and her professional discipline all reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her final act isn’t heroic but ritualistic, rooted in inherited duty and quiet competence. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion lives in tactile detail (supple hemp, warm plastic, trembling air). The monks’ legacy isn’t nostalgia but a lived counterpoint to modern meteorology, making her choice feel earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)

Her final acceptance of the covenant feels earned through embodied stillness, not epiphany. The ghost’s recognition mirrors Mira’s own unspoken grief, deepening motivation without exposition. However, the lack of active contradiction in her impulses (observation vs. participation remains theoretical) prevents full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The borrowed-time timekeeper’s motivation—to grasp the texture of time passing—is deeply embodied and consistent, driving her micro-choices (e.g., crafting garage sale listings as coded pleas). Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead rendering emotion through tactile perception (“sand through fingers that had forgotten they were holding anything”). The final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from sustained engagement with the urn fragment. However, her agency remains largely observational; the climax is a quiet comprehension rather than a decisive action, slightly limiting the cost’s visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—hands “warmly attentive,” perception filtered through poetic sensibility—and their motivation (to mend the broken) arises organically from character, not abstraction.

Emotions are embodied (“weakness in her limbs,” “braze of calm”) without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—skepticism versus wonder, academic rebellion versus longing for belonging. Her micro-choices (carrying the amber, ascending alone) reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s motivation—restoring the reef through ritualized memory—is consistent, embodied, and rooted in his identity as a ferryman of the dead.

The final smile reads as earned but borders on unambiguous closure without visible cost beyond time or effort.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—finding his brother through a tactile, sensory-driven quest—is rooted in consistent traits (bloodhound perception, tactile intuition) and intensifies credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, guilt, and awe manifest through tactile details (the compass rose, the sketchbook) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation stems credibly from familial legacy and scientific hubris, and her final shift from control to reverence feels earned. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the “cold clarity” arrives with minimal friction between her intellectual and emotional selves. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but the single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Caelius’s motivation is rooted in consistent, morally complex traits—his chivalrous theft and guilt over the sundial lid drive tangible action. His interiority is embodied (“cold bite into his bones,” “weight lifted”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. Seraph’s presence pressures his choice without resolving it for him, and their dynamic reveals a hierarchy of values: restitution over possession. The final renunciation feels earned, though the emotional shift leans slightly tidy given the brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her “benevolently ruthless efficiency” coexists with grief for her sister, and her crisis-actor past informs present choices without exposition. The loss of the pawns mirrors her inability to substitute for irreplaceable human absence, deepening motivation. Her micro-choices (walking patterns, placing the board) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over utility, gesture over resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The seer’s internal contradiction—between fear of her gift and longing for home—is rendered through embodied, tactile choices (glass hands, feather-textured stone) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final decision to leave the mountain is earned by seven nights of micro-choices tracing the stone, culminating in a whispered question that reconfigures her relationship to memory. The keeper functions as a pressure catalyst without over-explaining, and the seer’s flaws (self-imposed silence, substitution of reality) directly shape her arc. No safety-hedging: she accepts pain as the price of gratitude.

    Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her shame over the nobleman’s son coexists with quiet pride in having taught him sacrifice’s true cost. Her micro-choices (avoiding the labyrinth, then decoding the tapestry) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over reputation, instruction over obedience. The fidgeting hands motif embodies her restless intellect without veering into diagnostic self-awareness.

No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from tactile, sensory engagement with the statue and charm.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his aloofness, grief, and artistic paralysis feel embodied, not abstract. His micro-choice to place the painted shell in the pool crystallizes his reconfiguration of creation as release, not possession. The contradiction between longing to preserve beauty and needing to let it go drives every gesture. No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges from tactile, sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and deeply particular—her grandmother’s teachings, the tactile memory of salt-worn granite, the embodied tension between fear and duty. Her micro-choices (uncorking the vial, placing hands on brass) reveal a hierarchy of values: service over self, quiet faith over spectacle. The contradiction between her inexperience and profound responsibility fuels authentic struggle without safety-hedging. Final renunciation isn’t stated but enacted: she forgoes recognition, trusting whispers over shouts—a cost felt in the solitude of dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her lunar attunement, tactile reliance on the censer foot, and raw vocal honesty reveal a character shaped by grief rather than defined by it. Her choice to walk north with the caller is earned through prior self-knowledge and consistent with her role as a “patchwork navigator.” The final image of shared tears and bronze gleam crystallizes her moral stance without sentimentality. Minor deduction: the woman’s internal state remains slightly underdeveloped, though this fits the single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is exquisitely rooted in her traumatic memory of a lost emotional world, and her “involuntarily truthful” nature manifests as both wound and weapon. Her interiority avoids diagnostic abstraction—grief, joy, and recognition are embodied through precise sensory recall (“dissolved into strangers’ shoulders,” “electricity of recognition”). The final choice to study discredited cures in the hollow is earned by her consistent pattern of seeking value in ruin, and the cost—being marked dangerous, isolated—is palpable in every interaction with the armored world. Her reflection in the orchard (“fractured but functional… graceful in the broken way”) crystallizes a self-conception forged through sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile interaction with the Edelweiss, his “borrowed memories,” and his quiet obsession with absence reveal a psyche shaped by abandonment. His final decision to write to the address feels earned, not epiphanic, grounded in decades of isolation and the sudden crack in his emotional armor. The story avoids therapy-speak; his grief manifests through sensory detail and micro-choices (e.g., fingers tracing brittle petals). However, the stranger’s role as messenger borders on contrivance, slightly weakening the causal chain of Aldric’s motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s motivation—rooted in grief, legacy, and empirical intuition—is rendered with concrete specificity and internal contradiction. Her decision to step through the door emerges not from epiphany but from decades of tactile knowledge converging under pressure. The final choice carries visible cost (abandoning the rising world above) and is earned by prior causality: her father’s promise, the ants’ guidance, and the chip’s resonance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in slipping boots, warm brass, and cold water at her ankles.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“tears on her cheeks that smelled of copper and wonder”) and consistent disenchantment. Her motivation—to unravel the mystery of bleeding starlight dreams—is rooted in prior experience and deepens under pressure. The final choice (to re-engage with purpose) is earned by her journey and the grotto’s revelation, though the shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. No secondary characters dilute focus, and her “softly commanding” voice reveals hierarchy of values without explicit declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is richly embodied—her scientific romanticism manifests in tactile reverence for the columella and emotional recalibration at twilight. Her transformation from extractor to acknowledger feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., pressing the shell to her cheek, whispering a secret). Sera functions effectively as a pressure point, not a prop. However, the final epiphany edges toward diagnostic articulation (“density of presence”) without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene to fully satisfy the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied, with contradictions woven into perception (“lucid dreaming gave me that much… yet I could no longer distinguish which version of myself was doing the recognizing”). His micro-choices—writing, weeping, deciding to sleep—are charged with cost and shaped by his chronicler’s disease. The jealousy toward his past self reveals a hierarchy of values now lost, and the final renunciation of resistance (“fighting the current only tires you for the drowning”) feels earned. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail like “crusted sap” and “ink-stained fingers.”

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is richly embodied—her loss of smell refracts through tactile attention to water clocks and the birthing screw, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (early arrival, handling the screw) reveal a hierarchy of values: patience over performance, attention over sensation. Mira’s quiet presence functions as crucible without intrusion, her history deepening stakes through shared silence rather than exposition. The final renunciation of mourning feels earned through accumulated sensory reorientation, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to transform scars into stories—is embodied in her trembling hands, ink-stained fingers, and crystallizing tears, all converging in a final act that renounces cynicism for belief. Her internal conflict between scholarly skepticism and ancestral intuition operates simultaneously, not as alternating moods but as layered tension. The scars on her palms ache with memory, and her choice to inscribe truth rather than textbook runes carries visible cost: the shedding of intellectual armor. This credible endurance (Earned Stasis) forecloses her old self with emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, fear, and self-reproach manifest in tactile metaphors (“words tangled like loosened strings”) and concrete micro-choices (pocketing the bottle, descending into the archive). Margot’s flickering presence reveals relational history through subtext, not exposition. The apology avoids therapy-speak, landing with raw specificity (“I pruned myself from your life”). Flaws feel lived-in, not symbolic, and the final renunciation—accepting an imperfect miracle—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion and a clear hierarchy of values revealed through her ritual movement and handling of the dictionary. However, her motivation remains abstract—“witness” and “unravel cosmic illusions” are asserted but not dramatized through conflict or choice. No decisive action or renunciation occurs; she observes, carries, approaches—but never chooses under pressure. This lack of agency prevents higher stakes or cost, limiting character impact despite strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aira’s interiority is richly embodied—her reverence for the clocks, her isolation, and her epiphany about time as change are rendered through tactile perception and ritual action. Her motivation (“to understand what clocks really measure”) is consistent and deepened by seventeen years of practice. The final realization feels earned, not diagnostic, though the lack of external pressure or contradictory impulses in-scene slightly limits the portrayal of internal conflict. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s spatial giftedness and professional identity merge into a coherent, embodied perception that drives micro-choices—like her precise stance at the intersection of networks—and culminates in an Earned Stasis: accepting departure as revolutionary love. The man’s cracked voice crystallizes years of silent negotiation, revealing how restraint itself became intimacy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture (hovering fingers, unmoving bodies) and luminous thresholds. The triangle of “familiar strangers” functions as crucible without exposition, each character’s presence pressuring Mira’s final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her mathematical mind and emotional inheritance clash in embodied, specific ways (“likelit compartments,” photographing subway scrawls instead of sitting). Her final choice—to interpret the scrawls as invitations to “stop playing and start living”—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: relinquishing the fantasy of controlling loss through calculation. The father’s silent presence at the end crystallizes their shared flaw without sentimentality. Both characters remain morally ambiguous yet deeply human, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness even in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied and consistent—her cultivated estrangement, grief-as-frequency, and quiet endurance reveal a hierarchy of values (listening over correcting, presence over identity). Her micro-choices (never revealing herself, learning callers’ patterns) are rooted in a credible, flawed compassion. The harmonica disc functions as both object and emotional analog without tipping into therapy-speak. Final renunciation—remaining nameless, unseen—is earned through eleven years of accumulated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied emotion and micro-choices—her fear of examining the photo too closely, her ritualized breathing of the jetty’s scent, her final kiss to the locket—all revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in preservation-as-care. Her contradictions (fear of loss vs. desire for truth) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to extend the covenant into an unknowable future—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she accepts impermanence while committing to memory. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory immersion and tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    The logistician’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—jocularity masking vulnerability, competence shadowed by penance—and their final admission (“I need someone to remember my name”) emerges organically from established avoidance patterns. The woman functions as a precise pressure point rather than a full secondary arc, keeping focus tight. Micro-choices (laughing desperately, staying until midnight) reveal hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through voice, silence, and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her blindness informs perception without romanticizing it, and her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (trusting the ring, kneeling, weeping “without sadness”) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: surrendering external navigation for inward cartography. The final renunciation (“not a destination but a doorway”) feels earned through consistent sensory logic and accumulated pressure. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her understanding emerges strictly from tactile, auditory, and mnemonic cues.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her shame over “planting the wrong seeds” fuels her patient, context-driven signal analysis. Her micro-choices (e.g., using the pen as ritual, tracing contingent relationships) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in inherited wisdom over institutional protocol. The emotional arc avoids tidy resolution; instead, she endures with “confident uncertainty,” accepting exile as filtering rather than failure. However, her internal conflict leans more on reflection than simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marina’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, professional identity, and evolving understanding of silence manifest through precise physical gestures and micro-choices (e.g., signing new shapes “without permission”). Her contradiction—interpreter of speech yet inheritor of untranslatable silence—is dramatized, not summarized. Elena’s presence crystallizes relational stakes without flattening either woman into archetype. The final hand-holding enacts a renunciation of isolation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her moral outrage over knowledge hoarding, and her analytically intuitive nature drives key decisions with visible cost. Her internal conflict—between destruction and preservation—is embodied in the opening arson and later archival devotion. The final renunciation of burning in favor of preservation feels earned through her three-year immersion. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized clarity rather than messy contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her rebellion, grief, and sensory attunement feel specific and contradictory. Her micro-choices (e.g., drumming the childhood signal) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: enduring physical trauma to sustain connection. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation of her epiphany (“Mira’s dream… finally beginning to breathe”), which edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by the visceral drumming that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile memory of the labyrinth, her grief-anchored rituals with the coin and key, and her micro-choices (e.g., trusting footsteps over radios) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her contradiction—technological competence paired with deep distrust of institutional systems—fuels every action without diagnostic self-awareness. The final silence to Reyes isn’t stoicism but earned endurance, foreclosing reconciliation with official channels at visible social cost. No emotional flatlining; her father’s ghost lingers as pressure, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The canal guardian’s interiority is concrete and particular—her silence, trauma, and empathy are embodied through micro-choices (settling nearby without intrusion, using the dental mirror) rather than abstract labels. Her past and present intertwine via the boy’s presence, creating credible emotional continuity. The revelation that she was once the boy adds depth without over-explanation. Her final renunciation of speech remains consistent and costly, earning her Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her patience, perceptiveness, and quiet subversion are embodied through action (“cradling doubts like wounded birds”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation stems from a coherent worldview that intensifies into tactical rebellion (window displays). The story avoids tidy resolution: her change is endurance, not victory, with the cost being perpetual marginalization. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; her solitude reinforces her role as catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her guardedness, labor-carved grace, and emotional armor manifest in tactile detail (“hands sure, steps fluid,” “walls that would have impressed the old fortress engineers”). Her contradictory impulses (longing for freedom vs. fear of vulnerability) operate simultaneously in the climactic moment, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to step into the water—is earned through layered micro-choices (unclasping the scrimshaw, pausing mid-rope-coil) and carries visible cost: surrendering her father’s talisman and her identity as “careful Maren.” No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through sensory immersion and action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s moral ambiguity is embodied through precise micro-choices—whittling as memorial, narrating to deceive surveillance—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief and defiance are rendered through tactile action (“wood yields,” “face remain perfectly blank”). The contradiction between performance-as-survival and performance-as-oppression intensifies coherently. Final renunciation of mandated joy is earned by prior causality and carries the weight of maternal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cloud-shadow poet’s motivation is vividly rooted in her aesthetic identity and historical prohibition, compelling her forward with emotional and philosophical stakes. Her internal conflict—between reverence and transgression—is rendered through embodied perception (“tremor of certainty,” “tears forming”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional awe; no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made, weakening the Earned Stasis or Charged Poise needed for full 9+ eligibility. The final choice feels inevitable, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through her unique perception of beauty in imperfection, and her “innocently cunning” trait manifests in deliberate, costly choices—especially the gifting of the reed tongue. The apprentice’s parallel arc feels earned, though his transformation leans slightly on implication over dramatized struggle. Their relationship functions as a crucible, with status dynamics subtly shaped by craft and attention. The final renunciation—passing forward her most treasured object—carries visible emotional cost and forecloses a path of solitary guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile relationship with the carbide lens, her professional identity as a prism-song bell ringer, and her moral struggle to manufacture authenticity all feel specific and lived-in. Her motivation intensifies organically from technical problem-solving to a quest for the “texture of connection,” culminating in a renunciation of control that feels earned. The final micro-choice—not to force belief but to “invite” it—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars her psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief “threaded into her work like silver filings in clay”—and her micro-choices (tucking the stencil, offering the pendant) reveal a hierarchy of values forged through centuries of mourning. The new arrival’s translucent form and devastated eyes are rendered with precise emotional specificity, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, Elara’s transformation from passive keeper to active guide lacks a visible internal struggle in the moment; her wisdom feels inherited rather than wrestled with anew, slightly undercutting the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is grounded in tactile detail and inherited practice, while Soren’s tremor and confession reveal a man undone by his own compulsion to reverse-engineer chaos. Their micro-choices—Maren handing him the tape, Soren pulling twelve feet—embody their internal states without diagnostic label-speak. However, Soren’s emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than earned transformation; his shift from hollow-eyed analyst to hopeful seeker lacks a concrete on-page pivot beyond the card reading itself. The final renunciation of control is implied but not dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation evolves credibly from scholarly ambition to existential necessity, and her internal conflict—between grasping and surrendering—is embodied in the dance’s irregular rhythm. The shift from “pure scholarship” to “desperate and necessary” pursuit is grounded in specific emotional stakes. However, the epiphany arrives with near-perfect self-awareness (“I understood that this had always been the true purpose”), bordering on diagnostic clarity that slightly undercuts the messiness of real transformation. Still, the final choice—to step into the pagoda’s light as both vessel and release—feels earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile memory of the river stone, her grief-laced attention to archival footage—but her motivation remains observational rather than agentic. The story hinges on endurance (Earned Stasis), yet her final choice lacks a decisive micro-action that forecloses a path; she watches, again. Her “softly deliberate” trait shapes rhythm but not consequence. Still, emotional contradiction (preserving hope while haunted by loss) is rendered with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her grief, self-reproach, and dawning clarity emerge through embodied detail (“tremor in her chest,” “fragile architecture of her new understanding”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (reconstructing the tail, deciding to face staff) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in compassion over certainty. The betrayal forces a credible endurance that forecloses blind trust with visible emotional cost. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her misbeliefs are corrected only through present action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scarred palms, anesthesia-fogged cognition, and plant telepathy all root her trauma in sensory reality. Her contradictory impulses (to flee vs. return, to blame vs. forgive) act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract summaries. The final press of her hands against her brother’s prints earns her emotional shift through concrete, costly action. No diagnostic label-speak; grief manifests through coffee rings, frost migration, and ivy’s voice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied and consistent, with contradictions woven into her perception of “unused love” and her decision to leave the film strip hidden. Her spatially imaginative trait isn’t just stated—it shapes how she interprets emotional residue as architecture. The final choice (not retrieving the reel) is a credible renunciation rooted in prior causality, carrying the cost of forgoing revelation for preservation. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through sensory and spatial metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seraphine’s internal conflict is vividly embodied—her desperation, exhaustion, and eventual surrender feel earned and specific. The astrolabe and remembered stardust function as extensions of her psyche, not mere symbols. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“creativity could not be seized. It had to be surrendered to”) without sufficient contradictory resistance in the moment, softening the emotional friction. Still, her final choice to rest constitutes a credible renunciation with palpable cost: weeks of sleepless striving abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictions—her dreamless sleep yet deep custodianship, her refusal to trade yet willingness to engage—are embodied in micro-choices (checking the clock, gripping her staff) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final declaration (“I cultivate the sparks”) emerges from prior causality, not epiphany, and carries the cost of perpetual guardianship. The merchant functions as a crucible without overstepping scope; their exchange sharpens Mira’s resolve through status-neutral dialogue weighted by shared grief. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cyrus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his philosophical disorientation manifests through tactile, sensory-rich perception rather than abstract musing. His micro-choice to place the gear at the tangle’s center crystallizes a hierarchy of values: understanding over control, surrender over mastery. The final renunciation (“no back to return to”) feels earned by his prior rejection of laboratory certainty. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; insight emerges through action, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion and concrete contradiction—her “comfortable constraint” versus “stubbornness” that keeps her alive. Her final choice to release the leash and step onto the middle path feels earned by prior micro-choices (rising despite joint pain, accepting the token). However, the ferry guides’ lack of on-page pressure or relationship dynamics limits full exploration of crucible stakes. The absence of a second character with active agency slightly narrows the motivational field.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied sensation—nerve regeneration, the weight of the bolt, the silence of regret—never resorting to diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (safety vs. pursuit, silence vs. truth) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in the micro-choice to pocket the bolt and ascend. The final renunciation of flight is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. His flaw—choosing safety over speech—is not hedged but lived as a wound that slowly reopens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Threnody’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in generational justice, with her micro-choices (inscribing cryptic runes, using iron gall ink) revealing a hierarchy of values centered on truth over spectacle. Her interiority is embodied through tactile actions rather than abstract reflection, and her regal unpretentiousness manifests in quiet dignity amid decay. However, the absence of internal contradiction or struggle—she never wavers, doubts, or falters—limits emotional complexity. The final smile reads as earned but lacks the friction of genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tapping, her father’s atlas, her grief over bleached reefs—all reveal a psyche shaped by loss and precision. Her micro-choice to shift rhythms upon discovery demonstrates agency rooted in consistent traits. The contradiction between her scientific discipline and emotional need for ritual feels authentic, not diagnostic. Final renunciation isn’t of hope but of old maps—a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s motivation is rooted in generational legacy and grief, with interiority grounded in tactile details (bare feet, opera glasses). Her “awkwardly confident” stride evolves believably into earned certainty through micro-choices—kneeling, pressing palms, deciding. The final renunciation of passive waiting forecloses a path (continued lull) with emotional cost: she assumes leadership without guarantee of success. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (confidence vs. uncertainty) act simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yara’s interiority is richly embodied—her fear of persecution, grief for her mother, and quiet defiance shape every micro-choice. Anya’s insurgent spirit contrasts meaningfully, and their intergenerational tension crystallizes in the final hand-holding. Motivation is rooted in trauma and hope, not abstraction. The only slight flattening occurs in Anya’s dialogue, which leans toward declarative idealism without enough idiosyncratic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma manifests through tactile rituals, not therapy-speak. Micro-choices (keeping the photograph crumpled, refusing to smooth it) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her quiet talent isn’t just stated; it’s enacted through precise, somatic interactions with plants that mirror her emotional state. The freeze response is rendered as nervous-system truth, not melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—between artistic certainty and self-doubt—is rendered through embodied perception (“paint-stained fingers,” “hollow where her confidence had been”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (gathering cards, following threads) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over control, multiplicity over fixity. The final reconfiguration feels earned because her earlier failure (“noblewoman's face would not hold its shape”) directly seeds her epiphany about multitudes. No safety-hedging; her flaw—insistence on singular truth—actively destroys her career before enabling rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tracker’s serene anger and albino-sensitized perception are embodied with specificity, not labeled. His motivation—understanding time’s distortion in crisis—is rooted in lived trauma and deepened by Vasquez’s disappearance. The final choice to touch the ink is earned through consistent traits: patience, perceptual acuity, and a willingness to dissolve into mystery. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly limiting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kira’s interior conflict is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the weight of revelation against her chest—and her final choice feels earned by prior causality. Her moral struggle between archival duty and truth-telling manifests as simultaneous contradictory impulses rather than alternating summaries. The “bravely conflicted” trait isn’t merely labeled but enacted through micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a renunciation with visible cost: she abandons neutrality to become a messenger. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction: her rejection of her father’s violence coexists with inherited ritual precision, visible in how she “sheathes” memory like a blade. Her micro-choices—offering water to refugees, pruning with intention—reveal a hierarchy of values forged in opposition to her lineage. The ballast sandbag scrap functions as a tactile conduit for unresolved grief, not mere symbol. Final renunciation of vengeance is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Morwen’s cool-headedness is embodied through micro-choices—bare feet on humming ground, zigzag movement, voicing silence—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction (grief vs. hope) manifests physically via the rail spike’s changing weight, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—carrying the goddess’s echo in iron rather than restoring her—is earned by his lifelong mastery of stillness. Cost is visible: he remains alone on the coast, fishing for echoes only he can hear.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her devotion to observation clashes with inherited silence, and her micro-choices (e.g., gripping the pen, descending with purpose) reveal a hierarchy of values. The “proof by contradiction” method emerges from childhood teaching, not epiphany, and her realization carries the weight of generational cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (“smile… sharp as a paper cut”). Her flaw—trust in institutional reform—is credibly tested and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—guilt over her sister’s death—is visceral and consistent, driving every action from the search to the final intervention. Her constellation tattooist identity evolves meaningfully into a redemptive act, not just a profession. Internal conflict is embodied in trembling hands and desperate reverence, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, the transition from grief to agency leans slightly on conceptual convenience rather than fully dramatized psychological struggle, costing it 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between whimsy and doubt, permanence and impermanence—is rendered with embodied specificity: trembling hands, naming colors, abandoning mid-stroke. Her micro-choice to embed the tile flake feels inevitable yet transformative, revealing a hierarchy of values (truth over control). The “comfortable wound” metaphor crystallizes her flaw without diagnostic label-speak. Final permission to draw again is earned through tactile, sensory re-engagement, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lysara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her retrocognitive affliction isn’t just described but enacted through sensory overlays and micro-choices (e.g., tracing the tessera, recognizing Soren’s echo). Her motivation—to preserve memory through renaming—is consistent, morally complex, and culminates in a renunciation of passive grief for active mercy. The final act of naming Soren reveals a hierarchy of values: empathy over erasure, continuity over rupture. Flawed yet resolute, she avoids diagnostic self-awareness while carrying visible cost in her soot-blackened finger and haunted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her suicide of hope and tethered existence—is compellingly embodied through synesthetic perception and micro-choices like raising the coin. Mira’s despair feels visceral, not abstract, and her final reach for the coin enacts a credible, earned shift. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotions manifest as taste, texture, and light. The only slight gap: Mira’s transformation leans slightly on Elara’s intervention rather than fully dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, deepened breath, and shoulder tension reveal her emotional state without diagnostic labels. Her “affectionate skeptic” nature drives micro-choices: pressing the sliver to her temple, leaning closer despite doubt. The final renunciation of pills in favor of a gentler method feels earned through somatic discovery. However, the epiphany arrives with near-perfect calibration, slightly flattening the expected struggle between hope and skepticism.

    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and emotional heat-mapping, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to give voice to the world that evolved during humanity’s absence—is consistent and intensifies credibly upon encountering the elm leaf fossil. The final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from tactile engagement rather than abstraction. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her transition from passive sleeper to active witness lacks friction or doubt that would deepen psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in her belief that wisdom resides in small, overlooked artifacts. Her interiority is concrete—fingers calloused, eyes attuned to silence—and her micro-choices (cataloging by emotional resonance) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the story lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her conviction remains unchallenged internally, limiting the depth of internal conflict. The absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship-as-crucible testing, but within single-POV scope, her endurance is credible and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s motivation is vividly rooted in trauma and dormant courage, with embodied emotion (“burned face unreadable beneath the mist’s silver hush”) and micro-choices (climbing into exposure) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Internal conflict between fear and resolve simmers throughout without tidy resolution. However, the ally’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient groundwork for their trust dynamic, slightly weakening relational causality at the climax. The final gesture feels earned, but the interpersonal leap leans on implication over dramatized reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., “spindrift serenity… penetrate his being”) and micro-choices (touching the needle, deciding when to cross) that reveal a hierarchy of values. His motivation—distilling complexity into essence—is dramatized through decades of listening and carrying, not merely stated. However, the absence of active contradiction or struggle in the present moment (he simply waits and reflects) limits the demonstration of simultaneous conflicting impulses, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her phototropism to kindness, her reverence for fragility, and her tactile sensitivity to memory in objects feel intrinsic, not explanatory. Her micro-choices (adjusting grip on the lantern, choosing to sit rather than act) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in preservation over possession. The final decision to carry the oasis’s “stubborn green” as secret glaze is earned through prior sensory and emotional calibration. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete perception (“honeyed vibration,” “dust that refused to settle”).

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her pragmatic grief, tactile memory of her father, and measured compassion reveal a coherent emotional logic. The child’s silent shift from tears to quiet attention shows reciprocal growth without sentimentality. Micro-choices (offering the gauge tooth, planting the cutting) embody her belief in patient hope. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; emotion emerges through action, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—grief for extinct species and the burden of memory—is deeply rooted in her identity as a reincarnated witness. Her internal conflict between isolation and connection is rendered through embodied perception (“brittle awakenings,” “heart… understood before her mind”) rather than diagnostic abstraction. The final choice to wade toward the eastern stacks earns its emotional weight through prior causality: each life has prepared her for this reconfiguration of grief into ancestral honor. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, slightly capping full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her contradictory impulses (speaking for others yet remaining silent herself) manifest in concrete choices, like retrieving the nest and planning the installation. Her emotional state is embodied through tactile perception (“ran her finger along the inner spiral”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final realization—that she is a “weaver of connection”—feels earned by prior accumulation, not imposed. Her micro-choice to tuck the nest into her bag crystallizes a shift from keeper to creator with quiet cost: years of anonymity now transmuted into public offering.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly rendered through her profession-specific perception and embodied choices (e.g., adjusting the array guided by charts and intuition). Her cautious hope evolves credibly into resilient resolve, with micro-choices—like risking equipment damage—revealing a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional state occasionally leans toward diagnostic self-awareness (“cautiously hopeful despite the magnitude”) rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting ongoing conflict as inevitable—feels earned but lacks a sharper, visible cost tied to personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature manifest in embodied, contradictory impulses—panic versus stubborn will—that drive micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation is rooted in familial duty and personal rebellion, intensifying credibly as stakes rise. The final act of taking the key feels earned through prior struggle, with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the core of her perception—her interiority is rendered through tactile, emotional geometry rather than visual recognition. Her motivation (to awaken dormant empathy) arises from personal loss (mother’s Alzheimer’s) and drives every micro-choice: kneeling at the quarry, arranging pigments “like a surgeon,” painting from emotional residue. The final portrait reveals not Marguerite’s face but her “hunger to be seen”—a contradiction only Elena could resolve. Flawless integration of trait, trauma, and tactic with visible cost: she offers peace, not justice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “nervously confident” posture, ink-stained fingers, and trembling hands reveal a psyche torn between institutional deference and ancestral duty. Her motivation is rooted in generational shame and scientific justice, intensifying credibly as she deciphers the journals. The final choice—to rise and act despite institutional silence—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of professional risk. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the transition from passive cataloguer to active truth-bearer lacks a micro-mistake or hesitation that would deepen plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fiddler’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “dynamically observant” perception, tactile handling of the glass flake, and micro-choices (turning back, tucking the fragment away) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in years of bridge-playing ritual. Her motivation—to hold space for vanished moments—is consistent and deepened by the hitchhiker’s disappearance. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of certainty; she accepts fractured testimony as sufficient, which forecloses a path to literal reunion but opens one to mythic continuity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory precision (“oils of a century’s handling,” “frantic, trapped-bird motion”).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus and Elena are vividly drawn through embodied contradictions—his “polished calm” masking inherited outlaw wisdom, her “perceptively calm” exterior concealing turmoil. Their micro-choices (e.g., Marcus pulling the foreign bill, Elena’s brittle laugh) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost. The relationship functions as crucible: their shared history and divergent thresholds for erasure force a pivotal renunciation. However, Elena’s internal shift leans slightly on dialogue summary rather than fully dramatized physical resistance, just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her dream journals, tactile handling of the telegram, and lifelong attunement to stellar rhythms reveal a psyche shaped by observation and solitude. Her motivation (decoding inscriptions via lucid dreams) is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, the final renunciation of isolation feels slightly preordained; the internal conflict lacks a visible counter-impulse in-scene (e.g., hesitation to share). The choice to write “for all who would come after” is earned but leans on thematic inevitability over dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s guarded solitude, hubris, and grief are rendered through embodied choices—bare feet on moss-slick rocks, deliberate seed-pressing—not diagnostic labels. His internal contradiction (desire to fix vs. shame of failure) acts simultaneously in scene, culminating in a renunciation of perfectionism that forecloses his old self with visible cost: reputation lost, orchard saved. The final micro-choice—to walk away as the plant works—is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values (duty over ego). No safety-hedging; his flaw *is* the engine.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The root-bound visionary’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scar, her rootedness, her "purposefully curious" nature—all converge in micro-choices that feel earned. Her final act of planting the clipping arises from decades of observation and inherited duty, not sudden epiphany. Contradictory impulses (terror vs. triumph, stillness vs. expansion) operate simultaneously without diagnostic self-awareness. The linking through scars grounds her motivation in lineage, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in visceral grief and rendered through concrete, embodied choices—offering memories, trembling hands, the warmth of the card—avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her internal contradiction (desire to reclaim her sister vs. cost of joy) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final renunciation feels earned: she trades happiness not for resurrection but transference, accepting a new architecture of being. The apparition’s “fierce gentleness” mirrors Elara’s own, deepening character through relational echo without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—his “confident uncertainty,” tactile reliance on the speaker cloth, and emotional insulation via appraisal facts reveal a psyche fractured by grief and public failure. His micro-choices (turning off/on the phone, pressing the cloth to his palm) crystallize values under pressure. The final decision to drive to Elko emerges organically from his history and flaws, not epiphany, with visible cost: re-entering the echo of loss. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in dovetail joints and amplifier heat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—haunted ambition transformed into a desire for understanding—is consistent, deeply rooted in her profession and dreams, and culminates in a credible renunciation of fame. Her internal conflict between scholarly patience and desperate yearning is embodied in her journey and micro-choices (e.g., persisting through doubt). The final shift feels earned, not epiphanic, and the cost—abandoning public legacy for quiet transmission—is legible in her tears and acceptance. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion remains tactile and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Asa’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her mechanical form houses deep empathy, and her micro-choices (e.g., handling the creel with “gentle” bronze hands) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preservation without coercion. Her motivation—to shelter migrating identities—is consistent, rooted in her own hunger for rest, and intensifies through ritual rather than crisis. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge via tactile detail (“salt-thick air,” “soft whir of centuries”) and resonate with moral ambiguity. Her endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: she forecloses personal transformation to sustain others’, with cost legible in the “deep gears of her mechanical heart.”

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margret’s interiority is vividly embodied—her professional rigidity cracking open through tactile, sensory confrontation with the pearl and shells. Her hesitation (“heartbeat of a hesitation”) reveals layered contradiction: duty versus longing, skepticism versus awe. The final choice—to extract the pearl and redirect its purpose—is earned by her visceral reaction to the confessions, not abstract epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through quartz under boots, light in eyes, weight in palm.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and layered with contradiction—her trembling hands, the weight of the accordion, her shifting blame—all reveal a psyche under pressure without resorting to diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (entering the station, reading graffiti, holding but not playing the bellows) express a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of self-blame feels earned through prior causality, not declared. Her flaws (self-reproach, fear of recurrence) complicate every action without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer’s motivation—rooted in childhood promises and embodied through tactile interaction with the watch—is consistent and emotionally grounded. Her internal conflict between hope and caution manifests in micro-choices (e.g., documenting while trembling, pressing the watch to her chest) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction in peak moments (“cautious exuberant heart”), risking diagnostic label-speak without fully dramatized cost. The grandfather’s influence is potent but filtered through memory, limiting interpersonal crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interior conflict between scholarly certainty and artistic longing is rendered with embodied specificity—her hands tremble not from fear but from decades of repression. Her telepathic bond with plants isn’t decorative; it informs her epistemology and deepens her hesitation. The final choice feels earned because her flaw (over-reliance on documentation) directly opposes the violin’s demand for intuitive surrender. Cost is felt in the frost that shouldn’t exist—a physical manifestation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her dual identity as beautician and mortician. Her micro-choices—pressing the emerald chip, reading static for patterns—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (preservation vs. release) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality and consistent professional ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her forgiveness stems from visceral grief and clarity atop the ash tree, not abstract virtue. Her contradiction (peace yet hollowness) drives authentic micro-choices: repeated climbs seeking meaning, culminating in a realization earned through struggle. The absence of Aldric on-page after the backstory limits relational crucible, but her solitary arc remains coherent. Final renunciation of “completion” as contentment is credible and costly—she accepts perpetual tending without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “sincerely insincere patience,” the “cloak of doubt,” and the “protected vulnerability” that never fully heals. Her profession as a “conscience for hire” is not just stated but enacted through micro-choices (e.g., pointing silently to the chimes). The final self-reflection with the mirror shard reveals earned certainty without epiphany, grounded in eleven years of practice. However, the absence of on-page interaction with Thomas beyond summary slightly limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mina’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied memory and sensory recall, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Her motivation—to learn “vanishing”—is consistent and deepened by generational echoes, though the researcher’s backwards aging remains more poetic than psychologically causal. The final choice to throw the stone feels earned, revealing a hierarchy of values (patience, transmission) with visible cost: she accepts lifelong apprenticeship. However, the researcher’s internal contradiction isn’t dramatized beyond aphorism, limiting his depth as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stone skimmer’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and contradiction—her stillness versus spiritual wandering, reverence versus isolation. Her micro-choice to remain is credibly earned by centuries of practice and ancestral duty, not mere passivity. The arrowhead functions as both object and extension of her will, grounding motivation in tactile ritual. However, the lack of active resistance or internal debate at the climax slightly softens the cost of her renunciation, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in her quiet resignation and unspoken yearning. Her micro-choice to keep the keystone—against protocol—feels earned by years of dutiful invisibility. The final realization isn’t epiphanic but a slow unfurling rooted in tactile experience (warm stone, mist on skin). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in calibrated gestures and sensory attention.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his compulsive handling of the key tag, his years of silent searching, and his final realization feel earned and specific. His contradiction (hiding behind truth while seeking revelation) manifests in micro-choices, like returning nightly to the ship. The emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his epiphany emerges through sensory immersion, not exposition. The cost—nineteen years of solitude—is legible in his posture, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—her crouch to eye-level with the coins, the deliberate casting—all revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet witnessing over control. Her motivation stems consistently from her grandmother’s teachings, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness while expressing emotional complexity through action. The “quietly enthusiastic” trait manifests as determination without triumph, aligning perfectly with her worldview. However, the absence of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (rather than sequentially) prevents full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Melencolia’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her hollow chest, crystallized love, and tactile grief avoid diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. longing, numbness vs. feeling) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Her micro-choices—naming monsters, unrolling the atlas—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The final renunciation of fear through naming feels earned by prior causality and their shared history.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lukewarm mage’s internal contradiction—between perceived inadequacy and quiet resolve—is embodied in his micro-choices (e.g., choosing patience over force) and deepened by his father’s legacy. His earnest naivety isn’t just stated; it drives his method and becomes the story’s thematic fulcrum. The final act of ringing the bell carries visible cost: exhaustion, stretched magic, and emotional vulnerability. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion is rendered through tactile action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her vigilance as a levee warden mirrors her archival devotion to submerged memory. Her internal conflict between bureaucratic erasure and personal remembrance manifests in micro-choices: placing photographs, pocketing the label, sitting in dawn silence. The final renunciation—accepting that physical salvage may be reburied while stories must stay above water—is earned through tactile, emotional engagement with each artifact. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through precise sensory detail (“sapphire-hued liqueur label,” “cracked spine of asphalt”).

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—rigorous scientist versus secret sentimentalist—is embodied through tactile choices (cradling the crystal, weeping openly) rather than labeled. Her micro-decisions (watching starlings not as data but as “a letter from a beloved friend”) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. The final renunciation of her “scientist’s mask” is earned by decades of suppression and culminates in visible vulnerability. No diagnostic self-awareness mars her epiphany; wonder arrives as sensory revelation, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—white knuckles on the parachute buckle, muscle memory guiding calculations—and reveals a hierarchy of values (trust, precision, vigilance) under pressure. Contradictory impulses (need to act vs. role as observer) operate simultaneously without tidy resolution. Elena’s off-page presence functions as crucible, and the final renunciation of intervention (“I could not fly the plane for her”) crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarization mars the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal contradiction—numbness versus desperate longing for feeling—is embodied through precise physical and emotional cues, not therapy-speak. The clone functions as both mirror and crucible, forcing a choice that redefines identity rather than restoring it. Micro-choices (drawing the blade, uttering “Vivify”) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: surrendering the fantasy of wholeness for relational complementarity. The final renunciation of egoic unity is earned by the logic of dissolution and reconfiguration established from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly rendered through her profession, perception, and contradictions—she craves innovation yet feels commercial pressure; she values patience but watches the pot obsessively. Her micro-choices (shifting room designs, nocturnal brook visits) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: sacrificing marketability for integrity. The “notably receptive” trait is embodied, not labeled, and drives her acceptance of the seed’s mystery. However, the lack of on-page interaction with others limits relational crucible testing, slightly capping full character dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is deeply internalized and consistent, embodied through ritualistic action rather than exposition. His “mournfully eager” approach manifests in micro-choices—testing the pull cord’s give, accepting the engine’s cough—as tangible expressions of his philosophy. However, the character remains archetypal; his interiority leans on lyrical abstraction (“he had become” the work) rather than specific contradiction or flaw. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but within single-POV constraints, his endurance feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—her matted hair woven with torn pages, her eyes holding “pale luminescence”—and her emotional arc from feral waiting to active becoming feels earned. Her micro-choice to press the pendant to her chest catalyzes transformation without tidy resolution. The dimensionally homesick ache evolves organically into welcome through concrete sensation, not abstraction. Flaws like passivity early on serve her arc rather than weaken it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “stoic sensitivity” manifests in tactile actions (snapping the crozier, pressing fragments into embers) rather than abstract reflection. Her motivation intensifies credibly through seventeen years of failure, culminating in a surrender that feels inevitable yet costly. The final micro-choice—to destroy what she carried so long—reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over hope) with irreversible consequence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises from contradiction: she seeks to “beguile death” yet accepts annihilation as transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the hollywood star fragment and her rejection of institutional filtering reveal a character shaped by disciplined intuition. Her micro-choice to stop reaching for notation and instead “tune herself to” the silence is a credible, high-stakes pivot rooted in prior behavior. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding cosmic insight in physical sensation (“peace that hummed through her cells”). However, the absence of any contradictory impulse or tangible flaw slightly softens the final renunciation, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “resilient positivity” isn’t stated but enacted through micro-choices like preferring the empty hourglass and smiling at oblivious commuters. Her contradiction (acceptance vs. duty) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a self-sacrificial act that feels earned. The final choice carries visible cost: she remains a “permanent transient,” forgoing stability to maintain cosmic order. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion stays grounded in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fever dream architect’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and precise contradictions—her awe and dread of her own craft, the porous boundary between memory and fabrication. Her motivation (to reveal the “beautiful machinery” of consciousness) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses certainty with palpable cost. The flaw: minor diagnostic phrasing (“as memories alter… felt both like a scientific observation and a personal confession”) edges toward label-speak, though it’s swiftly grounded in sensory detail. Final endurance—sitting among threads, accepting indistinguishable memories—is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the anchor link, her “balancedly curious” tension between ancestral wisdom and alien mathematics, and her micro-choice to secure the chain before calculating all reveal a coherent, conflicted self. Her motivation intensifies credibly from teaching currents to navigating starlight through water, culminating in a renunciation that accepts infinite uncertainty. The cost—humanity’s solitude after the aliens’ departure—is felt in her quiet resolve, not stated. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphany mars her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “persistently curious attention” and professional restraint shape her actions without over-explaining. Her shift from detached observer to urgent protector feels earned through micro-choices: studying the hearing aid, adjusting frequencies, running into the mist. The final realization (“the dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard”) emerges from accumulated perception, not epiphany. Vera’s grief is rendered with specificity, but Elena remains the sole focalizer, avoiding head-hopping or diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s claustrophobia and loyalty to Elara create a credible internal conflict that culminates in a high-stakes, irreversible choice. Her emotional progression—from skepticism to awe to acceptance—is embodied through tactile details (e.g., gold flecks warming under her fingertips) rather than diagnostic labels. The final decision feels earned because it emerges from her established reverence for Elara and curiosity about the unseen. However, the transition into the network lacks micro-resistance; a fleeting hesitation or physical recoil would have deepened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her heartbeat-counting, ink-drawing, and shifting anger reveal a psyche shaped by bureaucratic erasure. The architect’s ghost isn’t a person but a haunting of conscience, and Mira’s final renunciation of blame feels earned through tactile ritual, not epiphany. Contradictory impulses—grief and gratitude, rage and reverence—coexist in her strokes of ink. The cost is legible: three years of ghosthood surrendered to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her copper veins, her quiet articulation, the weight of ancestral burden—all cohere into a singular, flawed identity. Her motivation to “translate texture into sound” is consistent, costly, and culminates in a credible endurance that forecloses silence. The final act of speaking into the tunnel is earned by decades of listening, not sudden epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in bone, dust, and refracted light.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and rooted in loyalty and intellectual curiosity, with embodied emotion (e.g., breath fogging, hair rising) and credible internal conflict between fear and wonder. Her final step into the harmony feels earned, though Amari’s transformation lacks sufficient on-page interaction to fully test their relationship as a crucible. The flint arrowhead and phone calls anchor her choices, but the story leans slightly on declared insight (“bitterness is cosmic humor”) over dramatized struggle in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is embodied through her violin, her journey, and her final choice to play, not explain. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (clutching the violin, heartbeat syncing with the shell).

Her final act feels earned, with cost implied in the statues’ transformation and the orchard’s reanimation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and morally complex, especially in his quiet rebellion against bureaucratic cruelty.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The carpenter’s interiority is deeply embodied—his silence, persistence, and tactile relationship with wood define him without exposition.

No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (frozen yet perceptive, passive yet purposeful) operate simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miriam’s motivation—her lifelong pursuit of where stories live—is embodied in precise micro-choices (carrying the scarf to the geometric heart, performing the ritual) and consistent with her “sanely eccentric” identity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead showing contradiction through tactile reverence for analog objects amid a hyper-rational setting. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her quiet satisfaction carries the cost of decades of solitude. However, the woman’s return feels slightly convenient, slightly flattening Miriam’s agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her longing manifests through tactile acts (rescuing books, applying pigment) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (working odd hours, experimenting at dawn) reveal a hierarchy of values: solitude over ease, witness over closure. The final renunciation—accepting the dream as captured, not reclaimed—earns its cost through prior causality. No head-hopping or safety-hedging; her flaw (relentless pursuit of absence) directly enables her resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “unassumingly bold fire” and seventeen-year vigil are rendered through tactile detail (velvet pouch, bruised-plum ribbon) rather than abstraction. Her motivation—freeing a sealed idea—is rooted in loyalty, grief, and intellectual devotion, intensifying credibly across time. The final choice to accept the philosopher’s single sentence as sufficient closure reveals a hierarchy of values: wonder over fame, truth over legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his shift from empirical skepticism to reverent belief feels earned through tactile choices (pressing his palm to the mushroom, weeping into the water). His chronic curiosity isn’t just stated but enacted with cost: thirty years of fieldwork, loss of memory, emotional vulnerability. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and desperate longing pulses in every beat. His final micro-choice—to return tomorrow—reveals a hierarchy of values where truth outweighs comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her backward-walking, unflinching gaze, and tea-leaf geometry reveal a character shaped by exile and resilience. The children’s terror and tentative pride are rendered with specificity, not stereotype. However, the boy remains underdeveloped beyond shrinking into himself, limiting relational depth. The final micro-choice (reaching for tea) earns its emotional weight but lacks the contradictory impulses that would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile, ritualistic action—her pruning, planting, and reverence for the seed reveal a lifetime of devotion without exposition. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through precise physical choices (e.g., “tenderness of a mother easing a child into sleep” juxtaposed with the weight of cosmic responsibility). The final act of planting functions as Earned Stasis: she endures the burden of being the last keeper of wonder, foreclosing personal rest with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “insatiably creative,” which leans toward label over dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her grief, discipline, and empathy emerge through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., pausing before the final knot). Her motivation stems from lived loss (father’s disappearance) and professional lineage, not exposition. The climax reveals her emotional contradiction: releasing the spirit means confronting her own unprocessed past. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment is consistent even under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered through her professional ethos and embodied restraint, particularly in her refusal to excavate further—a credible endurance that forecloses action with visible cost. Her contradictions (methodical curiosity vs. reverence) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. However, the lack of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible testing, and while her motivation is consistent, the final renunciation leans slightly toward idealized self-control rather than struggle. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, but emotional progression remains admirably controlled at the expense of visceral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is richly embodied—her “ache she couldn’t name,” her fluency in the deep, and her weary rapport with mortality reveal a character shaped by loss without self-pity. Her micro-choice to descend alone, then to extract the note, stems from a consistent, quietly obsessive drive. The contradiction between her scientific rigor and spiritual yearning (“physics of letting go”) feels authentic, not contrived. Final renunciation—committing to find Eleanor’s daughter—earns closure with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—to be heard across existential voids—is embodied with lyrical precision and deepens through her micro-choices (e.g., mixing cloudberries with dew, pressing ear to bolt plate). Her internal contradiction—lonely yet attuned, human yet harmonizing with ghost-code—drives every action without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of singing alongside the ghost feels earned by seventeen years of practice and emotional calibration. Flawed but competent, she endures with visible cost: her voice may never reach “eager ears below,” yet she sings anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s warmly inquisitive nature drives a micro-choice with tangible cost—opening the compartment—and reveals a hierarchy of values: empathy over protocol. Her internal contradiction (duty vs. curiosity) acts simultaneously, not sequentially, and her final renunciation (returning goggles silently) is earned by prior causality. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; her tenderness toward Jansen emerges from embodied perception (“goggles pressed to her chest”), not diagnostic labels. Minor deduction: Jansen remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miriam’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief filtered through cloud observation, her scientific rigor fraying into emotional taxonomy. Her micro-choices (working in the gondola, gripping the telescope) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, memory over forgetting. The only flaw is slight over-articulation in her epiphany (“absence was itself a kind of presence”), which borders on diagnostic but is redeemed by its grounding in the telescope’s physical weight and the spiral clouds. Motivation is consistent, rooted in inherited legacy and unresolved guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the core of her perception, driving her unique relationship with pattern and craft. Her internal contradiction—disconnection from people yet profound connection to cosmic order—is rendered through embodied choices (e.g., tracing constellations by touch, not sight). The final renunciation (leaving before demolition) feels earned, with cost legible in her solitude and the weight of inherited knowledge. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges through tactile action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s curiosity and emotional interiority are embodied through specific gestures—thumbing the phrasebook, scrambling for the spyglass—and her micro-choices (e.g., prioritizing observation over rest) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly, though her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves from wonder to determination without friction. The absence of true struggle or blind spots slightly softens the arc’s edge. Still, her endurance crystallizes into Charged Poise with visible cost: exhaustion, isolation, and the weight of potential discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thessa’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to her identity as a “lunar-eclipse locksmith,” with interiority rendered through precise, embodied details (“fingers, pale as moonlit porcelain”) rather than abstraction. Her final choice—sacrificing the gears—is earned by prior emphasis on repair as remembrance, not restoration. However, the lack of contradictory impulses in-scene (only reflective nostalgia) prevents full 9+ status; her struggle is atmospheric, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is consistent and compelling, though her agency remains spectral rather than active; Eli and Lena show credible micro-choices that reveal shifting values (e.g., Lena’s hoarding to giving). The ensemble cast avoids stereotyping through specific actions—Eli teaching from databases, Lena’s resource shift—but interiority is diffused across the group, limiting deep individual contradiction. Final renunciation of isolation is earned by prior communal labor.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in a generational duty that reframes doom as witness, not prevention. Her interiority is embodied through tactile interaction with the clock and puppet, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The final choice—to document rather than stop the end—is earned by consistent causality and carries the cost of all untold stories. Her whispered lullaby crystallizes a lifetime of reverence, making her endurance feel both personal and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s reluctance, embodied weariness, and quiet competence are rendered with precise interiority (“offhandedly exact,” “still sometimes stumbled”) that avoids diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—tucking the nut, descending the steps—reveal a hierarchy of duty over desire. The cost of inheritance is felt in her body and memory, not just stated. However, the child and woman remain voiceless props, slightly flattening the relational crucible despite their narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests as a “polymer chain” of guilt, her scientific lens shaping perception without diagnostic over-explanation. Her contradictory impulses (to atone yet doubt atonement’s validity) coexist in scene, not summary. The final micro-choice—to return to her lab with transformed vision—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of enduring unresolved loss. No safety-hedging; her flaw (prioritizing work over presence) is confronted through reconfiguration, not absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clean slate vendor’s motivation—seeking the origin of stories—is consistent and embodied through her method of “quantifying absence.” Her internal conflict between observation and intervention manifests in micro-choices (selecting bottles, arranging them) that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, her emotional embodiment remains slightly abstract; while her actions align with her philosophy, the felt cost of her renunciation (e.g., not writing herself) lacks visceral grounding. The final insight feels earned but borders on diagnostic self-awareness without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her gift is not just a trait but a lived burden that shapes every micro-choice. Her contradictory impulses (to flee pain yet seek it for purpose) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she touches the coral and chooses to stay. The final renunciation—accepting sorrow as endurance rather than failure—is earned through prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is embodied through taste, touch, and culinary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “empathetically decisive” nature manifests in micro-choices like speaking Romanian without preamble, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her contradictions (quiet librarian vs. active community conductor) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of credit (“only for the weight”) is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars her portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through her “helix-minded” cognition and embodied responses (e.g., “gloved fingers tingling”), grounding her transformation in consistent traits. Her final choice—to become an archeologist of abandoned dreams—feels earned by the mirror’s impact and her prior frustration with linear thinking. However, the transition from engineer to mystic archivist leans slightly on conceptual assertion rather than dramatized struggle; the “synaptic reorganization” occurs with minimal friction or cost beyond abstraction. The lack of a tangible sacrifice or concrete renunciation weakens the felt weight of her irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calyx’s motivation is deeply rooted in obsession tempered by time, and her internal conflict—between fear and intellectual hunger—is embodied in her choice to reenter the grotto. Her transformation from fledgling to “something harder” feels earned, though the lack of on-page interaction with another character limits relational crucible testing. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her endurance and reconfigured perception constitute credible Earned Stasis. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarization mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her identity as a “tree-song sculptor,” and her micro-choices—carving the branch, securing the insulator—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on listening and resonance. Her internal conflict between industrial artifact and natural world manifests through embodied attention rather than exposition. The hedgehog observation subtly reinforces her ethos without sentimentality. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible cost beyond atmospheric silence, slightly undercutting full Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The exiled tutor’s interiority is concrete and consistent, embodied through tactile engagement with the worry stone and magnetic landscape. His motivation—finding beauty in difficulty—is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing the stone to his forehead, rising with resolve) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; instead, it unfolds as a reflective progression, not pressure-driven tension. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but the single-POV execution remains precise and unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in a lifetime of listening rather than force—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (patience vs. urgency) manifests physically through micro-choices like ear-to-clasp contact and resonator tuning. The final act of opening the diary isn’t a leap but a culmination of her philosophy, with visible cost: the risk of permanent loss. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from tactile, sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kalia’s ambition and sensory sensitivity are concretely embodied, not merely labeled, and her internal conflict—between achievement and stillness—drives every micro-choice. Her transformation from aversion to acceptance is earned through sustained, tactile struggle with the corpse flower, culminating in a renunciation of old ambition that carries visible cost: she no longer seeks recognition but serenity. The family doodling custom deepens interiority without exposition, and her olfactory trait actively shapes perception and resistance. No diagnostic self-awareness mars her epiphany; insight emerges through action, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cora’s motivation—curiosity as hunger—is consistent, embodied, and drives every micro-choice. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile perception (e.g., “pressure she could feel in her teeth”). The renunciation of taking the arrow tip is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she bears knowledge but not possession. Contradictory impulses—desire to possess vs. duty to protect—act simultaneously in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and profession-inflected—her perception of wind as leaving “fingerprints” reveals a mind trained in pattern recognition. Her motivation (foresight through data) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of mechanical-failure orthodoxy. The final realization—that some accidents are “hidden mathematics demanding payment”—is earned through on-page observation, not epiphany. However, her “rapidly adapting” trait is stated but not dramatized with trade-offs, slightly flattening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Yara’s synesthetic perception is not just a trait but a lived, embodied lens that drives every choice—her micro-decisions (e.g., waiting to ring the bell until the sculptor strikes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests as frozen tears, pulsing amber, chromatic sound. Her motivation—certifying wonder as essential—is consistent and intensifies under pressure without becoming tidy or over-rationalized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her trembling hands, deliberate steps, and silent regret feel earned, not diagnostic. Her flaw (paralyzing fear) directly caused Oresta’s fall, and her renunciation of interventionist guardianship reads as credible endurance with visible cost. However, the final insight (“some guardians were meant to witness”) edges toward articulation rather than dramatization, slightly undercutting the “no therapy-speak” standard in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is exquisitely particular—her “mathematics of emotion” isn’t abstract but embodied through tactile, emotionally charged acts like borrowing personalities from objects. Her final dissolution into transparency feels earned by seventeen years of disciplined self-erasure, not epiphany. The contradiction between her need for precision and the surrender to ambiguity is active in every beat, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her former self with visible cost: she becomes light, not person. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; even “arithmetic of the soul” is grounded in sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s jittery interiority is embodied and consistent, her grief and uncertainty rendered through tactile detail (“hands trembled,” “throat closed around grief”) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices—climbing despite fear, unclasping the pendant—reveal a hierarchy of values: loyalty to Mira over self-preservation. The final decision to “germinate something” emerges organically from prior causality, foreclosing passive mourning with visible emotional cost. Mira’s presence functions as crucible, not exposition, forcing Elara’s transformation without resolving her flaws—she remains “jittery,” now layered with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet on moss, her frost-reading ritual—and her motivation to prove emotional residue is consistent and deeply personal. The revelation that she herself has become part of the arbor’s “emotional library” emerges organically from seventeen winters of practice, not as an epiphany but as a slow dawning. Her contradiction—observer yet participant—is rendered without therapy-speak, through tactile perception and micro-choices like pressing the prism to glass. The final smile carries earned cost: her solitude is both sacrifice and communion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The loom spinner’s motivation—carrying a message across impossible distance through weaving—is rooted in generational grief and embodied in precise, tactile choices. Her internal conflict between self-preservation and self-sacrifice manifests simultaneously in her hesitation and resolve, culminating in the ultimate act of becoming the message. The amber bead and puzzle edges function as extensions of her will, not mere symbols, and her final choice feels earned by fifteen years of searching. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional abstraction mars her crisis; her trembling hands and steady scissors convey contradiction without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cael’s motivation—quiet determination born of overlooked competence—fuels every action without grandiosity. His interiority is embodied in tactile labor (hammer, silk, roots), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of credit (“Let others claim it was divine providence”) reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: anonymity for communal hope. No epiphanies feel unearned; his endurance forecloses self-assertion but reconfigures his world.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, longing, and dissociation manifest through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the shard to the panel). Her motivation stems from a consistent, flawed desire to retrieve lost truth, not escape. The final renunciation—accepting her wound as purpose—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“the knowledge that her ability was not a gift but a wound”) without sufficient counterbalancing irrationality or hypocrisy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s reticence and warmth are embodied in precise, consistent choices—her silence isn’t passivity but a mode of witnessing. Her stacking of stones is a micro-choice that crystallizes her inherited duty, foreclosing escape with visible cost: she carries the sea’s grief in her pocket. The grandmother’s backstory is anchored in the sea glass and tilts Maren’s present action without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“stones were warmer here, almost feverish”).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—his laughter, his handling of the wick, his quiet joy—all reveal a man shaped by solitude and duty. His accidental prophecy feels intrinsic, not tacked on, and his final renunciation of recognition (“He did not mind this”) carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses—between isolation and care, power and humility—act simultaneously in scene. The character reads as wholly individual, not an archetype draped in poetic language.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yuen’s interiority is concrete and grounded in his profession as a dye master, with emotions embodied through tactile observation (e.g., watching light on the wing). His motivation—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is consistent and intensifies through reflection tied to present stimuli. The realization about “accumulation” and receptivity feels earned, not epiphanic, and aligns with his grandmother’s legacy and the donor’s character. However, the absence of on-page interaction with another character limits relational pressure, keeping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The warden’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile attention to stone, sextant, and storm conveys a lifetime of quiet devotion. Her motivation (to witness and map sorrow) emerges organically from memory and duty, not exposition. The final descent enacts Earned Stasis: she accepts the burden of unmaking as maintenance, with visible cost in solitude and emotional labor. No diagnostic label-speak; grief is measured through action, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s fractured identity and sacrificial arc are rendered with visceral specificity; her micro-choices—swaddling the Heart-Tree, singing the Binding Chant—embody contradictory impulses (preservation vs. release) that culminate in a credible, costly transformation. The final renunciation—becoming “less whole” to restore the realm—is earned through consistent interior logic and embodied emotion. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; feelings arise through action and sensory detail (“laughed and wept as the light swept”).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her empathy as a “stone in her chest,” her tactile relationship with the crumpled invitation—and her contradictory impulses (to flee yet remain within arm’s reach) act simultaneously in scene. Her final renunciation isn’t tidy; it’s a Charged Poise earned through accumulated reflection that alters tactics (choosing to reply tomorrow). No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, and her flaw directly enables the closure. The cost—years of absence, emotional paralysis—is felt without being overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her noticing, her rituals, her quiet grief—all embodied in micro-choices (breaking bread, sweeping flagstones) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her contradiction—devotion to preservation amid decay—is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation isn’t dramatic but deeply earned: she accepts tenuous absolution as sufficient. No flaw touches closure; her endurance carries visible cost across seventeen years.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her meticulous control versus her dawning emotional surrender—and her final reorientation feels earned by decades of quiet devotion. Her micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the resonator with “surgically precise movements”) reveal a hierarchy of values that culminates in the renunciation of preservation for understanding. The shift from measuring to seeking meaning carries visible cost: the acceptance that magic must yield to memory. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from concrete observation, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile awareness of the watch fob, her calibrated patience, and the haunting phrase “capture the sound of trust breaking” reveal a psyche shaped by inherited trauma and underground codes. Her contradictory impulses (to trust vs. to withhold) act simultaneously in the final exchange, not as abstract reflections but as micro-choices under pressure. The scarred woman’s presence forces a crystallization of values without over-explaining motive. Minor deduction: the father’s betrayal lacks sufficient on-page friction to fully ground Mara’s emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s skepticism and bioluminescence are tightly interwoven with her choices, especially her use of the compass ring and descent to meet Seren. Her internal conflict—between empirical doubt and sensory wonder—is embodied in micro-choices like tasting the ring and flickering luminescence. However, Seren’s introduction leans slightly on archetype (“smile contained clouds”), and Mira’s shift toward belief lacks a fully dramatized struggle; the epiphany feels earned thematically but not through sufficient on-page friction. The cost of her evolving stance is implied (abandoning pure skepticism) but not viscerally felt in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—technical precision versus suppressed vision—is embodied in her charcoal-stained hands and crystallized in her hesitation before the canvas. Her perfect memory isn’t just a trait but a cage, making her epiphany feel earned, not declared. The final choice to paint carries visible cost: she must overwrite her own judgment with Elena’s abandoned courage. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail (“charcoal fingers hovering,” “mineral residue on my lips”).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with the zinc plate, gold leaf, and shredded map reveals a psyche shaped by loss, craft, and inherited silence. Her motivation stems from a consistent trait: devotion to truth through calligraphy, intensified by her师傅’s fate. The final choice—to write unsaid truths—is earned through prior causality and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (devotion vs. doubt, permanence vs. decay) pulse in action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve the “color of wonder” in ancient ice—is embodied through micro-choices (carrying the fragment, tuning sculptures) and deepened by her seasonal muteness, which frames silence as plenitude. Juniper’s arrival crystallizes relational stakes without dialogue, revealing mutual understanding through gesture alone. Interiority is rendered through sensory perception (“listened with her whole body”) rather than exposition, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation—accepting silence as sufficient—earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost: she forgoes speech for nine months to steward truth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Cara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her rebuilt hands, organic blood, and blurred identity between machine and caretaker feel simultaneously specific and mythic. Her contradictory impulses (to contain chaos vs. surrender to it) act in real time during the climax, not as abstract reflection. The final choice—to miniaturize fear rather than destroy it—is earned through decades of tending, with visible cost: fragmentation into “all the moments she had contained.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in titanium veins and static-filled processors.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and particular—her curation of memory emerges through tactile observation, not abstraction. Mrs. Okonkwo’s restrained grief and the locket’s revelation feel earned, not illustrative. However, Elena’s final realization (“listening was not passive but generative”) edges toward diagnostic phrasing without sufficient embodied contradiction in the moment. The emotional arc is credible but lacks a visible trade-off that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her dance, her dice-counting, her encrypted journal—all revealing a psyche shaped by trauma yet defiantly generative. Her motivation (to liberate through coded resistance) intensifies coherently, and her final choice feels earned by every prior micro-decision. The only slight flaw: the spider metaphor borders on over-signaling, slightly flattening the complexity of her endurance. Still, her transformation from silenced subject to lyrical agent carries undeniable cost and credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, curiosity, and inherited duty manifest through tactile actions (clutching wildflowers, reading coffee grounds) rather than abstract reflection. Her contradictory impulses—between forgetting and remembering, duty and discovery—are active in-scene. The final choice to touch the crystal feels earned by seventeen years of lantern-lighting and maternal inheritance, with emotional cost legible in the pressed flowers’ warmth. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    The summoner’s motivation—rooted in maternal memory and resistance to coerced fate—is rendered with visceral specificity. Her internal contradiction (mastery of summoning vs. desire to unmake) manifests through embodied micro-choices: tracing silence like braille, inviting rather than commanding the crane. The final renunciation of prophecy-as-decree is earned by her gradual epiphany about vibration and frequency, with the cost legible in her solitude and the irreversible downstream journey of the wing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s motivation evolves from curiosity to necessity with embodied emotional stakes, and her final renunciation—“I don’t need to know”—is earned through layered micro-choices (e.g., accepting the tutor’s silence, touching her hand). The tutor’s patient nimbleness and cryptic wisdom feel specific, not archetypal, and their relationship functions as a crucible that crystallizes Elena’s values. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are conveyed through tactile detail (cool hand, groaning pipes) and perceptual shifts. The only flaw: the tutor’s backstory remains slightly abstract, though this is thematically justified.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal conflict between scientific skepticism and inherited intuition is rendered with precise, embodied contradiction—her fingers “closing around” the shell while her mind resists its implications. Her micro-choices (kneeling, listening, rising) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over certainty, connection over control. The final renunciation of pure skepticism is earned through tactile, sensory engagement rather than abstract epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through jasmine, twilight, and bone-deep resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yuki’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and morally complex—her struggle with complicity, silence, and restoration feels earned. Her micro-choices (e.g., approaching the wall with “skill and intention”) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The Archive Keeper’s calibrated treason is rendered through precise physical detail (weathered face, mahogany thorn), not exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution, culminating in forgiveness as active renunciation, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and emotional contradiction, particularly in her conflicted relationship with the seashell and her burden of hearing “echo people.” Her motivation—to uncover why some souls lose their voice—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, her final choice lacks a decisive micro-action that visibly forecloses an option; she steps into the song, but the cost remains abstract rather than embodied. The absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ghost-whisperer’s motivation—salvaging purity from wreckage—is vividly embodied through her meticulous dream analysis and shrine tending, not merely stated. Her interiority is concrete: “weaving truth carefully from fragments strangers carried in their dreams” shows method as character. Yet the child’s restoration feels more like a mission than a psychologically fraught reckoning; the protagonist’s personal stakes remain abstract, limiting emotional contradiction. A stronger internal conflict—e.g., doubt about disturbing the dead—would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yuki’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her calloused fingers tracing invisible patterns, the bamboo whisk as both tool and talisman—and her contradictions (philosopher/net-mender, daughter of tea and tide) cohere without explanation. Her micro-choice to whistle—a childhood act reclaimed in solitude—reveals a hierarchy of values: reverence for hidden effort over adult propriety. The cost is subtle but felt: vulnerability in a moment of private communion, risking sentimentality yet earning it through specificity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile memory and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her observational discipline, emotional restraint, and moral clarity emerge through micro-choices like her hand moving toward the satchel and her decision to stay through the storm. The orchard keeper serves as a sharp foil, her mapped eyes and sardonic delivery pressuring Mira without veering into caricature. However, the final endurance lacks a visible cost beyond atmospheric poise; the story implies sacrifice but never dramatizes what Mira forfeits by staying. This near-miss prevents full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her cracked lips, protesting joints, and gritted isolation ground her visionary status in physical reality. Her variant allegiance isn’t just stated but enacted through micro-choices: turning from the Council, then from mystics, now placing her palm on the portico. The final smile earns its weight because it crystallizes years of renunciation into hope. However, her internal contradiction leans more toward summary (“loyalty meant nothing if you couldn’t see…”) than simultaneous opposing impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s internal shift from collector to translator is credibly earned through embodied reactions—especially his visceral response to the music box—and his micro-choice to hand it over reveals a hierarchy of values. However, his past “wasted years” and “burned bridges” are asserted rather than dramatized, weakening motivation’s causal chain. The granddaughter’s arrival feels slightly instrumental, though her role sharpens his realization. His final purpose emerges with emotional weight but leans on retrospective summary more than on-scene contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her terror of ice-shattering memories clashes with her technical mastery, creating authentic contradiction. Her micro-choices (adjusting the key by “fractions of millimeters”) reveal a hierarchy of values: legacy over safety, intuition over pure logic. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation—phrases like “logically emotional” verge on diagnostic label-speak, though it’s redeemed by immediate dramatization. Final endurance feels earned, with visible exhaustion and relief as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “softly purposeful” movements, the “restrained wildness” rising within her—and her motivation to sculpt patience from impatience is dramatized through concrete choices (tracking moon paths, waiting for ice groans). Her contradictions feel lived-in: restless energy transformed into durably patient work. The final act of unyoking ancient energies feels earned by decades of disciplined attention. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and ritualized action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her “watchfully calm” professionalism clashes with visceral unease and moral urgency. Her micro-choices (photographing remains, preparing independent copies) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over institutional compliance. The flashback to her great-great-grandmother grounds her motivation without sentimentality. However, the entangled memories arrive with near-instantaneous clarity, slightly undercutting the struggle for earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Father Thomas’s interiority is concrete and particular—his “aptly deliberate” responses, his hesitation before repair, his reflection on Marcus Webb—all reveal a man shaped by institutional gravity and private ritual. His micro-choices (e.g., adding a hidden inscription) embody a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time, emotional labor, and the risk of overstepping. The contradiction between mechanical fixity and spiritual ambiguity plays out in scene, not summary. His transformation is subtle but earned: the repair becomes an act of grace, not just craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cart glider’s interiority is vividly embodied—its “yearning algorithm,” greasy hands, and axles that shiver with recognition fuse mechanical and emotional registers without diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (devotion vs. irreverence, curiosity vs. cargo duty) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. Every micro-choice—holding the arrow tip at precise angles, laughing amid cosmic absurdity—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: social alienation, functional deviation from design. The final renunciation of utility for transcendent purpose feels earned by consistent, escalating causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s “brightly attentive” trait is embodied through micro-choices (enlarging the patch, tracing numbers) and internal contradiction—she’s both loyal archivist and truth-seeker. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to moral urgency. The final renunciation (choosing to follow Yuki into silence rather than restore or erase her) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: she becomes complicit in the company’s hidden archive. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels mar her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her “calm intuition” and “shadows that laced through her work like veins through marble” reveal a self-aware yet conflicted peacekeeper. Her final choice to use the fragment rather than repair it emerges organically from her established ethos: understanding over resolution. The shopkeeper’s silent exchange and Mira’s micro-choices (holding the crystal, watching faces dissolve) demonstrate hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is exquisitely embodied and particular—her actuarial past informs her present perception without diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses (endurance vs. departure) coexist in scene, especially in the parasol tip’s tactile presence. The final renunciation is earned through accumulated micro-choices (trawling, listening to ice) that foreclose alternatives with palpable cost. Her loosened grip on reality evolves from dissociation to preparation, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, restraint, and quiet reckoning feel specific and lived-in. His micro-choices (tracing the burned paper, walking back to the pavilion) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by decades of loss and devotion. The flaw: his “gently persuasive” self-deception is told rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly weakening motivation’s causal link to past action. Still, his renunciation is earned through consistent emotional logic and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in her role as a preserver of memory and boundary, embodied through her half-mask and peripheral awareness. Her internal conflict—between the over-perceiving left side and the intuitively trusting right—is consistent and physically manifested. The final renunciation (“because the boundaries remember”) is earned through decades of implied labor, not stated but felt in ritualized action. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and the cost—while resonant—remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and particular—her reverence for broken photographs, her tactile care with archival tape, her refusal to invent missing faces—all reveal a character whose motivation (transmuting pain into witnessed truth) is consistent and embodied. Her micro-choices (pressing torn edges, leaving space for absence) carry visible cost: she accepts incompleteness as ethical. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or internal friction—her calm borders on untested certainty—prevents full 9+ status. The story presents her as flawlessly aligned with her mission, which risks idealization over complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and scholarly obsession feel authentic, with embodied contradictions—e.g., stealing the crystal while believing in silence as testimony. His micro-choice to return the crystal reveals a hierarchy of values: reverence over possession. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous opposing impulses in-scene; desire to decode and acceptance of silence alternate rather than collide. The epiphany about “completion” risks being slightly over-articulated, though it’s grounded in tactile observation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s precognitive forgetfulness is not merely stated but embodied in her driftwood system and chalk ritual, grounding her internal contradiction in tangible action. Her emotional arc—from searching to receiving—feels earned through micro-choices (arranging markers, touching chalk) that reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over prophecy, presence over prediction. The final renunciation of future-knowing for present listening carries visible cost—years of futile searching—and crystallizes her flawed yet coherent worldview. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak; tears form “at the corners of her eyes” as a physical echo of tidal longing, not an abstract epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—grief, obsession, and professional pride intertwine without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to photograph the spinning hand rather than repair it reveals a hierarchy of values: acceptance over control. The father’s absence functions as both backstory and active pressure, shaping every gesture. No epiphany feels unearned; insight arises from tactile engagement with tools, glass, and motion.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—her “decisively kind” nature manifests through micro-choices (e.g., calling Margery’s daughter off-page) rather than declaration. Contradictory impulses (serenity vs. grief, professional duty vs. personal mortality) coexist without resolution, deepening authenticity. Margery’s presence functions as a crucible that sharpens Elara’s purpose, not merely a foil. The final wrist-grip exchange reveals mutual recognition of shared mortality, earned through precise emotional calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation as a rune scholar is consistent and embodied—her quiet deliberation, reverence for the observatory, and hunger to be “worthy” drive her actions. Her internal conflict between inherited theory and lived discovery feels authentic, especially in her tactile engagement with the key and shadows. The final choice—to relearn through practice—is earned by prior struggle and reveals a hierarchy of values (experience over dogma). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves steadily toward insight without meaningful doubt or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered: her "shrewdly innocent" self-perception, embodied grief, and contradictory impulses (loving a changeling while doubting her own motherhood) operate simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choice to place the tooth—not for revenge or understanding but for transformation—reveals a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. The refusal to identify the body crystallizes her renunciation of closure-as-ending, aligning with her arc. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (cold stone, porcelain skin, luminescent tooth).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s interiority is concrete, specific, and embodied—her grief, patience, and tactile memory shape every choice. Her contradictory impulses (longing for ascent vs. devotion to grounded craft) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—choosing a new radiance over old wings—is earned through seventeen years of micro-choices shown via her polishing ritual. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional truth arises from sensory detail and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and emotionally layered, with embodied contradictions (e.g., silence that “holds space for wounds”). The protagonist’s micro-choices—like withholding the data center visits—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma and care. However, the mother’s off-page presence limits relational crucible testing, and the absence of on-page interaction caps full motivation demonstration. The final renunciation (staying, witnessing) is earned through consistent emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The novelist’s internal conflict is vividly embodied—her fear, grief, and creative paralysis manifest through tactile details (the shell, the mossy stone) and micro-choices (sitting, weeping, rising). Her contradictory impulses—desire to create vs. fear of failure—act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The epiphany feels earned, not diagnostic, rooted in the sensory encounter with her abandoned characters. However, the resolution leans slightly toward emotional clarity over messy irrationality, softening the edge of true creative doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in generational duty and personal longing, with micro-choices (positioning the tendril, selecting the song) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing emotion through embodied ritual and sensory perception. The final weeping is earned by seventeen years of waiting and precise action, not sentimentality. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored—her fear of failure never visibly contends with hope, flattening emotional complexity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—translating heartbeats into maps of emotional terrain—is rooted in a specific, embodied loss (her grandmother’s death) and drives every action with psychological consistency. Her patience isn’t abstract; it’s physically enacted through deliberate movement and stillness under pressure. Internal conflict manifests as simultaneous impulses: urgency to preserve starlight versus the necessity of absolute slowness. The final act of sealing light into pattern is a credible endurance that forecloses no return, paid for in bodily ache and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s peripherally focused perception and reflective practice are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., using mirrors instead of disassembly), revealing a coherent hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—between repair as restoration versus redirection—is dramatized through action, not summary. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; her competence is balanced by the slow, uncertain nature of her work. However, the lack of interpersonal pressure limits the crucible effect, slightly capping emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fractal weaver’s motivation is clear and consistent: to transmute burdens into pattern rather than carry them alone. Her internal conflict—between release and permanence—is embodied in the calcification spreading from her fingertips, a physical manifestation of her bargain. The story avoids therapy-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile, sensory detail (“pressure behind the eyes,” “stone in the stomach”). However, the character’s past remains abstracted, and while her renunciation is credible, the lack of a specific, dramatized prior burden slightly softens the cost of her current endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The widow’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief manifests through tactile carving, not therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (holding vs. letting go) operate simultaneously in her hands and mind. Her micro-choices (ignoring the kettle, pressing glass beads into hollow eyes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she chooses ritual over utility, presence over function. The final renunciation—accepting the lion as both husband and not—is earned by prior causality and charged with irreplaceable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her scavenger pragmatism warring with spectral self-reckoning—and her micro-choices (collecting fragments, photographing the ghost) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on bearing witness rather than redemption. The ghost confrontation avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead grounding emotional complexity in tactile ritual (the camera wheel) and spatial stillness. Her final negotiation is not a tidy resolution but a renunciation charged with exhaustion-as-peace, credibly earned by prior accumulation. No safety-hedging: she accepts that some ghosts cannot be appeased, only endured.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a “functionally creative” engineer, with micro-choices (e.g., prioritizing community over nostalgia) revealing her values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile engagement with the sextant and sediment. The final decision to reframe the spaceport as a community center feels earned, though the emotional cost of her personal investment remains slightly under-dramatized. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—between honoring his grandfather’s unfinished dream and his own disbelief in its meaning—is rendered with exquisite specificity and embodied hesitation. His micro-choice to finally wind the clock emerges organically from decades of grief, not epiphany. The bear’s silent presence acts as a mirror, not a catalyst, preserving the introverted scribe’s agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in trembling hands and withheld breath.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to understand the “architecture of lies”—is consistently embodied through her actions, perception, and micro-choices (e.g., interpreting wear on the sundial, steering toward older brickwork). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile observation and historical intuition. However, the absence of a second character limits relational crucible, and while her endurance is credible, the final renunciation lacks a tangible cost beyond implied effort—keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in intergenerational legacy and philosophical inquiry, rendered through concrete sensory detail rather than abstraction. His interiority—filtered through seed-collecting expertise and tactile observation—feels authentic and specific. The final choice to plant ancient seeds emerges organically from his lifelong pattern of patient attention, with visible cost implied in the solitude and weight of inheritance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in snow-dusted hair and ink-stained fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The traveler’s interiority is richly embodied—her profession of writing obituaries for the living reveals a deep, character-specific contradiction between presence and absence. Her micro-choice to stay in the garden, despite missing the ship, emerges organically from her established pattern of documenting departures. The red thread functions as both tactile anchor and emotional compass, grounding her motivation without diagnostic self-awareness. Her final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, and carries the quiet cost of becoming part of the very absences she documents.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prince’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“air tasted of copper and nostalgia”) and micro-choices (releasing the sarcophagus catches, cradling the egg). His motivation—initially obedience to his father—shifts credibly toward integration after tactile discovery, with visible cost in forsaking the kill-switch mission. However, his internal contradiction (destruction vs. synthesis) resolves too cleanly; the epiphany lacks struggle, leaning on diagnostic phrasing like “bitter compromise” without sufficient prior doubt. The final choice feels earned but slightly unearned in its emotional ease.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, discipline, and compassion manifest through tactile choices (pressing sand to her cheek, gripping the coin) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (attraction to/repulsion from fire) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of inherited destruction in favor of healing purpose feels earned by every micro-choice, with visible cost in her solitude and vigilance. No safety-hedging: she remains flawed, haunted, yet unbowed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s luminous skepticism is embodied through micro-choices—her cautious handling of the box, her patient unstick process—and evolves without epiphanic rupture. Her internal contradiction (skepticism vs. openness to mystery) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating moods. The final renunciation—leaving markers for others—earns its cost through prior restraint and quiet labor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered via prismatic shadows, tactile sediment, and sidereal patience.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vael’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile and sensory perception—translucent hands, sonar pings, the gear’s warmth—and their emotional conflict (sentimentality vs. duty) manifests in micro-choices like ritual petal-catching. The final renunciation isn’t a decision but an acceptance of the gear’s awakening, which feels earned by generational weight rather than sudden insight. However, the lack of active choice or contradiction under pressure (Vael observes more than acts) limits full character agency. Still, the cost—carrying accumulated memory as burden—is felt consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile rituals (ribbon, chisels) and sensory focus rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (leaving tools behind, speaking the poem aloud) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: she trades closure for understanding, stone for silk. The “fiercely meditative” trait shapes her perception without over-explaining, and her flaw—dismissing spectral presence as delusion—is credibly overcome through earned sensory evidence. Final renunciation of perfect epitaphs in favor of imperfect hands feels inevitable, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief, guilt, and ritualized penance manifest through micro-choices (carving the rake handle, adjusting the pendulum) rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses—yearning for absolution yet accepting only incremental carrying—act simultaneously in the climactic pause. The rake handle’s inscriptions reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: his daughter’s name etched alongside “sorry” until the wood yields no more space. His final descent embodies earned endurance, not redemption, aligning flawlessly with his moral burden.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gardener’s motivation—his lifelong attunement to the silent dead—is consistent and rooted in his profession, compelling his descent and decoding. His interiority is concrete (“tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; his choice feels inevitable rather than fraught. The final renunciation carries quiet cost but isn’t dramatized as a foreclosed path with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete sensory detail and professional idiom (“ignorance cartographer,” “predictive modeling”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her contradictory impulses—humility vs. audacity, constraint vs. creativity—are active in-scene, not summarized. The kingfisher feather functions as both tool and symbol that embodies her epistemology. However, the final micro-choice (to write) lacks visible cost or tradeoff on the page, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—preserving stories through music and dust—is deeply rooted in her identity as both archivist and rebel. Her interiority is vividly embodied: the “thistled calm,” the tactile care with scores and radio, the scientific curiosity about dust. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. subversion, memory vs. erasure) coexist without resolution, intensifying her quiet endurance. The final choice to broadcast isn’t a shift but an affirmation of her life’s work, with cost implied in vigilance, isolation, and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her simultaneous reverence and resentment toward her grandmother, her sacred sorrow in breaking the porcelain, and her acceptance of incomplete understanding. Her micro-choices (burning the portrait, filling the mask with ash) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over illusion, ritual over resolution. The final renunciation—carrying fragments she’ll never fully comprehend—is earned by prior causality and charged with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; grief emerges through texture, not taxonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent: a rational rebellion against historical erasure, anchored in the physical labor of salvage. Interiority is concrete (“I agonize over this evidence because it demands a price”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—choosing slow, solitary truth-work over communal myth—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (social isolation, futility). However, the character’s emotional range remains narrowly intellectualized; embodiment is limited to tactile handling of artifacts, not visceral bodily stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her hatred, silence, and unlearning are rendered through tactile gestures (thumb on rosette), breath, posture, not therapy-speak. Her contradiction—yearning for harmony while fearing voice—is active in scene, not summarized. The young man’s “expectantly resigned despair” mirrors her past, making their interaction a crucible that reactivates her arc without head-hopping or abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s motivation—rooted in her synesthetic gift and rejection of institutional commodification—drives every choice with emotional and thematic consistency. Her interiority is vividly embodied through taste, memory, and tactile action (“chef’s hands remembering the language of pruning”), avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The final act of pruning as rebellion feels earned, with visible cost in her renunciation of academic validation. Contradictory impulses (desire for solitude vs. duty to lineage) operate simultaneously during the seed’s consumption.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s involuntary truthfulness and quiet devotion are embodied in precise micro-choices—her trembling hands, her refusal to embellish—and culminate in a credible endurance that redefines her role. Mira acts as both catalyst and mirror, forcing Elara to confront the cost of her humility without undermining her consistency. Their dynamic feels authentic, not instrumental, and the child’s certainty contrasts meaningfully with Elara’s self-doubt. The final climb and revelation emerge from prior restraint, not sudden transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—her noticing is not just trait but method, embodied in micro-choices like handling the coffee cup “as if sanctified.” Her contradiction (craving connection yet trained in solitude) operates simultaneously in scene. The final realization feels earned through accumulated perception, not epiphany. Flawless integration of inherited sensitivity as both gift and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thalassor’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his shift from rigid certainty to nuanced witness feels earned through embodied perception (e.g., “kindness without nuance was merely cruelty with good intentions”). His contradictions act simultaneously: guardian yet listener, stone yet sentient. The alchemist’s memory catalyzes a credible, costly reconfiguration of self, not an epiphany. Final choice—to share understanding, not hoard truth—forecloses his ancient role with resonant emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—grim optimism paired with relentless inquiry—and her micro-choices (e.g., re-examining a dismissed formula) reveal a hierarchy of values. The chipped die functions as both tool and psychological anchor, embodying her flawed yet rigorous epistemology. Her emotional state avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting through tactile detail (trembling hands, meticulous handwriting). The final renunciation of escape for understanding feels earned by prior causality and carries the cost of perpetual uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied insomnia, tactile longing, and precise emotional contradiction—especially in her trembling fingers and methodical hope. Her motivation (deciphering the lost language to honor the calligrapher) intensifies credibly into a climactic act of creation. The final choice—to leave the paintings for others—feels earned by her prior isolation and yearning for connection. However, the epiphany arrives with near-instantaneous clarity, slightly undercutting the struggle implied by “methodically hopeful.”

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s motivation—preserving endangered arts through ritual and memory—is deeply rooted in her identity as a museum guide and granddaughter, and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict between dread and duty manifests in embodied choices (baking initials, carrying the beekeeper’s loaf) rather than abstract reflection. The historically oriented trait informs her worldview without over-explaining, and her final act of walking toward the thaw is earned by prior micro-choices. However, secondary characters remain atmospheric rather than crucibles, limiting relational depth within the single-POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Iris’s motivation—fleeing a prophesied death to defy fate—is consistent, embodied through her counter-clockwise clocks and precise solitude. Her internal conflict (desire for liberation vs. risk of annihilation) manifests physically in her handling of the yoyo and emotionally in “bleak exhilaration.” The final renunciation of linear time feels earned by her seventeen-year preparation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s interiority is richly embodied—her contradictory impulses (desire for surrender vs. duty to finish her grandmother’s work) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The confession before the mirror feels earned, not diagnostic, and her micro-choices (clutching the clasp, stepping forward despite warning) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Her flaw—welcoming death to escape a world “too loud, too sharp, too real”—complicates every action without safety-hedging. The final renunciation of fear-as-monster is rooted in consistent traits and prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prophet’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and ritual action, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her motivation—to translate oceanic chaos into music—is consistent and deepened by her lifelong practice. However, while her contradictions (e.g., burden vs. gift) are implied, they aren’t dramatized as simultaneous impulses in a single pressured moment. The final smile suggests endurance, but the cost of her role remains atmospheric rather than viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation—driven by grief, doubt, and quiet obsession—is embodied through tactile actions (kneeling, pressing her palm, using the whistle) rather than exposition. Her internal conflict between institutional silence and personal truth manifests in micro-choices that foreclose compliance. The reed whistle isn’t just a charm; it’s a bridge to agency, and its use carries emotional and possibly existential cost. Her flaws (stubbornness, isolation) feel lived-in, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dr. Vance’s emotionally rational trait is vividly embodied, not merely labeled, and her internal conflict—between filial loyalty and historical integrity—is rendered through precise, contradictory impulses. Her micro-choice to open the satchel and confront the letter crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: rupturing her town’s mythology and dishonoring her grandfather’s silence. The backstory is tightly anchored in present stimuli (the rosebush, the bench, the station) and tilts her stance via concrete action. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, capping full 9+ potential.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maren’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with the inkwell, her cold-soaked endurance, and her quiet renunciation of passive surveying reveal a stoic yearning that feels earned, not asserted. Her contradictory impulses (to document vs. to commune) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when she both retrieves and deposits artifacts. The final choice—to carry the story forward as “permission”—is rooted in fifteen years of observed loss, making her transformation credible. No diagnostic label-speak mars her epiphany; insight arises from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—tracing honest origins—is deeply woven into her actions and perception, and her final resolve emerges organically from accumulated observation. Her interiority is concrete (“tranquilly perceptive,” noticing “small rebellions”), and her micro-choices (pressing the stamp, comparing marks) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the absence of internal contradiction or struggle under pressure slightly limits emotional complexity; her epiphany feels earned but not wrestled from doubt. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, grounding insight in tactile discovery rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s grief is embodied with exquisite specificity—her polishing, folding, and refusal to serve the basilica reveal a hierarchy of values forged in loss. Her interior contradiction (desire to hold dreams vs. knowledge they must remain private) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final crane-folding renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she builds containers instead of seeking reunion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual.

    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory, embodied, and rooted in trauma without resorting to diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to hunt “unused potential” rather than seek closure reveals a hierarchy of values forged in catastrophe. The geode functions as both emotional anchor and cognitive lens, grounding his obsession in tangible sensation. His endurance constitutes Earned Stasis: he forecloses healing for the sake of an unanswerable quest, with palpable cost etched into every line.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation—searching for a “frequency of belonging”—is consistent, embodied in her sharp-eyed observation and trail-following, and culminates in a credible epiphany that feels earned rather than diagnostic. Her perpetual surprise is not a label but a lived trait that informs how she perceives revelations. The final realization avoids therapy-speak by grounding insight in tactile experience (the warm chip, the press’s heartbeat rhythm). However, the pilgrim remains a cipher, limiting relational depth, though this is acceptable under single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, the physical weight of guilt, and the tactile sifting of driftwood reveal a psyche fractured by complicity. Her final renunciation (accepting the truth she buried) is earned through prior causality: her profession directly enabled her mother’s request, making her moral injury self-inflicted. The contradiction between manufacturing false memories for others while fleeing her own truth drives every micro-choice. However, the emotional climax leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“cancer of guilt”) that borders on label-speak, costing a hairline deduction from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his "uncommonly thoughtful" nature wars with inherited guilt, and his final renunciation feels earned. The woman’s exhausted recognition avoids stereotype; her presence functions as a crucible that crystallizes his choice. Both characters embody emotional complexity without diagnostic self-awareness, especially in the line: “carrying guilt that was not hers to bear but was hers nonetheless.” Their micro-choices—extending hands, then letting go—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her uneven strokes, the compass’s cold weight, the osprey nest as involuntary memory—all revealing a fractured yet resilient self. Her contradictory impulses (withdrawal vs. re-engagement) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The renunciation of her old identity and tentative embrace of a new navigation method feel earned through micro-choices (choosing poles over stars, launching despite fear). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her emotional void as “a house with all the furniture removed” and her tactile response to the baseball ground her amnesiac state in sensory reality. Her contradictory impulses (cynicism vs. awe) coexist credibly in the final moment, avoiding tidy resolution. The time traveler’s presence functions more as mirror than crucible, slightly limiting relational pressure, but Vera’s micro-choices—reading clippings by bioluminescence, moving with patience—are consistent and revealing. Motivation stems organically from her desire for empathy, though the procedural backstory risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysara’s internal conflict—fear versus readiness, human identity versus ancestral calling—is rendered with visceral specificity and embodied emotion. Her micro-choices (crushing spices, kneeling, whispering) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the surrender of her fully human self. The final renunciation is earned through consistent motivation rooted in grief and lineage, not epiphany. However, Korin exists only in memory, limiting relational crucible depth; this single-POV focus is appropriate but caps full character interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, ink-stained palm, and visceral guilt anchor a complex emotional arc. Her contradictory impulses (magic vs. motherhood) act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract regret but through tactile choices: pressing the saucer to her palm, letting blood mingle with ink. The final renunciation—accepting what cannot be reclaimed—is earned by prior causality and carries palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; pain and forgiveness bloom through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seraph’s pacifism is not only consistent but causally active—her refusal to harm directly shaped past losses and informs her present stitching as nonviolent integration. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying contradiction through tactile choices (e.g., threading optical fiber through grief-laden photographs). The gravitational lightness when happy is both a physical trait and emotional barometer, culminating in authentic weightlessness at closure. Her final step through the dimension feels earned, not epiphanic, because every micro-choice reaffirms her core conflict: compassion over control.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent: her destitution is not performative but lived through micro-choices like uncorking jars at the eclipse’s apex. Contradictory impulses—hoarding light yet releasing it, seeking transformation yet claiming no agency—act simultaneously in scene. Her epiphany (“transformation is not a destination but a continuous becoming”) arises from tactile experience, not diagnostic abstraction. The final renunciation of ownership (“holding beauty she would never keep”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “calmly inventive” nature is consistently embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tracing angles, rotating the quill—that reveal a hierarchy of values (curiosity over obedience). Her internal contradiction (duty vs. discovery) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final decision to transmit the message feels earned by prior causality, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her precognitive curse, grief, and devotion manifest through concrete sensations (“burned behind her eyes like embers,” “promise lingered... like a second heartbeat”). Her micro-choices (using all remaining star dust, stepping onto the rocks) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of control in favor of connection feels earned by prior causality, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional contradiction is woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling palm, the timer’s rhythm, the crackle of paper—all revealing a psyche shaped by censorship and silence. Her contradiction (“furious and serene”) manifests in action: reading aloud to thunder, not people. The final choice—to write on glass, ephemeral and uncensorable—is earned through prior micro-choices (climbing, opening the envelope). Cost is felt: years of self-censorship, the fragility of her reclaimed voice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Varn’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradiction—his mechanical arm symbolizes both loss and mastery, and his philosophical stance (“turning questions into destinations”) actively shapes his fencing tactics. The younger scholar remains underdeveloped but functions effectively as a foil; their dynamic crystallizes around incompatible epistemologies. Varn’s micro-choices (e.g., withholding the needle card, redirecting rather than striking) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on transformation over victory. However, the opponent’s shift from “desperate intensity” to sudden defeat lacks sufficient on-page friction to fully earn the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira and Delphine are rendered with precise interiority, embodied contradictions, and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—Mira’s decision to share her hidden poems, Delphine’s quiet revelation of her past as a pianist. Their flaws (isolation, secrecy) directly shape their cautious trust. The lunar-cycle identity condition is introduced without diagnostic label-speak, instead shown through the coffee tin’s contents and Mira’s poetic voice shifts. Both characters remain morally ambiguous yet deeply human, avoiding redemption arcs in favor of mutual witness.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and regret, embodied through his ritualized return to the station and the tidal arbor. His internal conflict—between enduring loss and seeking transcendent connection—is rendered with specificity and emotional honesty. The final choice to play Clara’s requested piece functions as Earned Stasis: a refusal to “move on” that forecloses conventional healing but affirms fidelity to memory. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction in interiority rather than micro-behaviors under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“boots crushed the scent of wild thyme and something else—something luminous”) and micro-choices (carrying instruments, pressing seed into bloom-flower). Her motivation—to reclaim cultural memory—is consistent and intensifies under monsoon pressure. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward acceptance without palpable resistance or doubt beyond the thematic “luminous doubt.” The final renunciation (“not to possess this knowledge but to carry it forward”) is earned, though the emotional cost feels slightly abstracted rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—his slow speech, bonsai practice, and tactile handling of lace and compass reveal a psyche shaped by loss without diagnostic self-awareness. His final pruning act enacts Earned Stasis: he forecloses pursuit of Elias, accepting unresolved grief with visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. restraint) operate simultaneously in quiet gestures, not summaries. The only minor slip is slight abstraction in “cerulean regret,” but it’s swiftly grounded in sensory context.
