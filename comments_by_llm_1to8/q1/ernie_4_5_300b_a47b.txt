    Elara's shift from cosmic detachment to greenhouse humility is signaled, but her interior life remains largely summary-level ("she'd begun preprocessing reality through a different lens"). The monarch chrysalis sequence offers one micro-choice beat (monitoring it daily), yet the final symposium choice to present dust patterns lacks visible cost or contradiction—colleagues' confusion doesn't foreclose a path on the page. Interiority leans toward thesis statement ("Decay isn't an event, it's a language") rather than embodied pressure, and the protagonist's renunciation of institute expectations feels declared rather than dramatized with trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's internal experience is vivid and embodied in moments ("her breath fogging the air," fingers brushing the ledger), but her core motivations remain abstract—"purpose in the pauses" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The glass-artist backstory provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction; her decision to retrace the smuggler's steps lacks a visible cost or trade-off that would elevate the choice. The final epiphany about "marking time" feels delivered rather than earned through struggle, and the promised future (teaching others, crafting panels) summarizes instead of crystallizing a present renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her interior work with the tuning forks embodies trauma processing, but interiority often summarizes rather than enacting contradictory impulses in the moment. The relationship with Elias develops through accumulation of silent exchanges, yet his function remains supportive rather than applying dramatic pressure that forces harder choices. The final shift to worldwide recognition feels telescoped, bypassing the embodied cost of that exposure for someone still fragile. Elias's translation role ("She's not broken...") edges toward therapeutic framing that flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is visible and his stubbornness operates on the page—he resists Marisol's stories, scoffs at the task—but many beats tell us his evolution rather than dramatize it through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to stay reads as declared rather than wrestled with in scene; we're told "his stubbornness softening into purpose" instead of watching the cost of that shift. Embodied emotion appears intermittently but key transitions lean on summary: "Years later, when explorers rediscovered the city..." compresses the arc's payoff. The weary-to-purposeful arc is legible but the decisive renunciation lacks visible on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to bridge generational divides is clear and drives her bell-ringing declaration, but her internal conflict remains shallow—she disagrees with the council yet faces no personal cost or hesitation that would deepen the choice. The widow's final whisper ("You knew") hints at earned insight, but the protagonist's arc feels more like confident execution than transformation under pressure. Embodied emotion is present in grip and gesture, yet the piece leans toward external orchestration rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Secondary characters (council, Mara, Jax, Lira) apply thematic pressure but remain functional rather than distinct agents with their own stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The pilgrim memory and "spiritually curious" label arrive as exposition without embodied cost. The breathing method and camera obscura work function as props rather than revealing character under pressure. The pool discovery feels declarative—"she understood now"—rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (discovering time's texture) is established early and drives her use of the fragment, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—she studies photographs yet dismisses legends without embodied friction. The retrocognitive visions are label-heavy ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") rather than showing how this constraint forces micro-choices under pressure. The final shift from "texture to be touched" to "story to be told" reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through visible cost; no prior choice is foreclosed on the page. Emotional embodiment is thin: "head spun," "fell to her knees" are stock reactions that don't reveal character-particular processing of the disintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael's core motivation (planting seeds for her people) is established, but her interiority reads as thematic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The chains function primarily as symbolic decoration rather than constraining live choices—she wrenches them free when needed without prior struggle or cost. Key beats like "The liberator was unchained at last" tell the transformation rather than dramatizing micro-choices that reveal it. Backstory about "generations ago" and "the wall came down" floats above present action without anchoring in a concrete stimulus that shifts her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory synesthesia ("lavender static," "green hum of moss") that feels ornamental rather than viscerally embodied. Her motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" is declared but never meaningfully tested by internal contradiction or a difficult micro-choice under pressure. The father's disappearance drives backstory but doesn't create a live on-page conflict that forces her to choose between competing goods. The final smile reads as self-satisfied rather than earned by a visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (thief of illuminated moments) but her interior life remains thin; the "quietly savvy" label appears without embodied tension. The photograph trade feels conceptually neat but lacks genuine emotional cost—we never see her attachment to it dramatized before she offers it. The final choice (leaving the photo) reads as thematic positioning rather than a wrenching sacrifice that forecloses a meaningful path. Competence is unopposed; no blind spot complicates her success.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation (craft safe zones for inquiry) is declared but never tested through concrete on-page choices with competing pressures. His interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("Perhaps this fracture is not a failure, but a map") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "decision" to abandon perfect answers and embrace cracks is told rather than dramatized through a foreclosed path or visible cost. The backstory about his mentor's death exceeds the allowance and flattens present tension into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lila's phobias are asserted but never constrain a meaningful choice on the page—she sidesteps the enforcer with agility despite claiming fear of contact, and the genetic hand-me-down framing reads as label-only backstory. The enforcer's "composure cracked" moment lacks embodied reaction, and Marisol's entrance at the café feels like a curtain-call rather than earned reconciliation. Therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power") saturates the dialogue and interiority without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's "mild obsession" with silences is established early and her interior voice carries some specificity ("the pause before a wave crashes"), but her motivation remains somewhat abstract. The final moment—standing with the glowing map—lacks embodied tension or contradictory impulses; she "smiled, her lips trembling" reads as generic emotional notation. The choice to return to the pebble shore tomorrow feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    Unit-17's core motivation (finding where thoughts come from) is consistently maintained, and the "remarkably composed" trait appears repeatedly. However, the robot's philosophical awakening arrives through convenient instrument contact rather than earned internal struggle. The interiority relies heavily on processor metaphors ("logic core flickered," "systems prioritizing data over emotion") that flatten rather than embody consciousness. The final encounter with the scientist offers declarative wisdom ("In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday") that reads as thematic assertion rather than hard-won realization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias possesses a clear initial trait (meticulous registrar) and his curiosity drives the inciting choice to follow the cryptic ticket. However, his internal contradiction and embodied emotion remain thin; the shift from observer to "translator of silence" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation—writing nothing, choosing doodles—lands with minimal visible cost because we never see what he forfeits by abandoning his logs.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove gardens remember their gardeners is clear and her actions are consistent. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she operates with steady confidence rather than wrestling contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation occurs more in Joren than in Elara herself, who remains static. Her marbles function as exposition devices rather than forcing difficult choices that reveal competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Veyra's motivation to prove the time-sideways theory is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or lived stakes. Her interiority consists largely of stock phrasing ("her mind racing," "sweat trickling down her temple") without embodied specificity. The final choice to reach for the lever again feels unmotivated—no prior dramatized cost or internal friction earns this decision. The director appears as a motivational device rather than a pressure source, and Veyra's competence never meets genuine struggle that would force visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to prove the ghost's existence is stated but her choices feel more observational than contradictory—she wades, kneels, traces, jots notes in a smooth chain without meaningful internal friction. The promise "I'll finish it" arrives as declaration rather than a choice that forecloses another path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, quickened breath) but leans toward label-only physiological markers rather than character-specific perception under pressure. The interiority remains generic ("felt most alive in these in-between spaces") without the particularized texture that would distinguish Clara's mind from a template.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's interior is vivid and embodied—pressing her palm to cold glass, tasting "metallic tang of a swallowed truth"—and her contradiction (oracle certainty vs. post-fever sway) drives her choice to descend. The fever's aftermath motivates her change, but the director and herbalist remain functional props rather than pressure agents. Her final smile and anchoring feel earned by the accumulated weight, though the transformation hinges more on accumulation than a single causal rupture with visible tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's core motivation—seeking "the weight of a swallowed truth"—remains abstract and doesn't generate meaningful internal contradiction. His skepticism is declared ("religiously skeptical") but never tested; the supernatural reveal simply overwrites his worldview without visible cost to his identity. The final gesture of leaving the valve wheel reads as symbolic rather than a choice that forecloses a lived path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "the thrill of the unknown gnawed at him," "his skepticism fraying."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper's motivation—to witness without judgment and find regenerative silence—is clear and sustained. Interiority is present ("their grip on reality loosening with each century"), though some passages lean toward abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to let go feels earned by the journey, but the transformation reads more as poetic summary than urgent lived struggle. Emotional embodiment is intermittent; phrases like "their heart light" trend toward label rather than sensory particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are coherent (nurture wonder, bridge mundane and mysterious) and her music-therapist patience shows in measured actions. However, her interiority relies on stock therapy-speak ("It's not just a curl. It's a link. To wonder") and the transformation moment lacks embodied contradiction—she moves smoothly from explanation to validation without internal friction. Mara's arc from skepticism to acceptance feels mechanical rather than earned through prior causal pressure, and the final choice (keeping the curl) carries no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to collect wall-stored stories is clear and consistent, and his probing actions show character-particular perception. However, the final "recognition" that shifts the axis feels asserted rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict. The tapestry's dragons "stirring" and voices rising read as exterior validation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied emotion is present in "trembled" and "breath caught," but the climactic moment lacks a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" arrives clearly, and the discovery of her father's letters provides causal grounding for her final choice. However, her interior life relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied contradiction—the fortune-cookie orchestration feels more concept than lived struggle. The final choice to continue the work lacks visible cost; she moves from discovery to action with confidence rather than wrestling with the moral weight of manipulating lives. Micro-choices exist but emotional complexity remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The priest's motivation ("to illuminate…hidden assumptions") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("stillness is a thread," "silence is a canvas") instead of embodied emotion under pressure. The final action—walking into "unraveled stillness"—reads as label rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the priest performs rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her past shapes her present, but interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The piece relies on summary reflection—"chronological homesickness pulsed," "she'd always felt out of step with time"—rather than showing competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. No on-page choice alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost; she writes fortunes at dawn as she always does, and the ending celebrates continuity rather than change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation—conquering the labyrinth of self—is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses during peak moments. The interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphysical phrasing ("not just in space, but through the procedural generation of her own life") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. The final descent feels declared rather than earned by prior micro-choices that foreclosed paths with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the gravity-defying gift remains a conceptual convenience without the grounded struggle of someone wrestling physical limits or social isolation in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation to break through emotional numbness is clearly established and her journey shows embodied progression through the cavern work. The deaf music teacher premise creates natural contradictions around sound/silence that drive her choices. However, key moments lean on therapeutic language ("emotional numbness," "the fog") rather than dramatized sensation, and the final transformation feels declared more than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Elias functions primarily as exposition rather than applying meaningful interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to document storms and hold power accountable is declared rather than revealed through contradictory impulses. The progression from isolation to activism feels schematic—"His motivation crystallized" tells us the shift rather than dramatizing it. The woman in the lab coat arrives as a plot convenience; no prior friction suggests why Elias would follow a stranger into a biohazard zone. The choice to burn the evidence ("some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved") contradicts his role as witness without visible cost or internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's core motivation—following light to understand time's texture—registers on the page, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("every verse you abandon is a thread left loose") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The rope-untying sequence provides embodied action, yet the final realization feels delivered by the being's exposition rather than earned through Kael's own micro-choices under pressure. The "ethically playful" label appears once without constraining a single on-page decision with visible cost, reducing it to ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her acoustic sensitivity shapes perception, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("chronic hush," "unbinding") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to share the bowl feels more thematic gesture than earned renunciation with visible cost. Relationships exist (crowd, grandmother's memory) but apply no immediate pressure that forces a difficult trade-off. The piece avoids diagnostic therapy-speak but doesn't dramatize internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is presented with clear traits (professionally thorough, affectionate detachment) but remains static throughout. His interaction with Lira demonstrates competence without struggle or contradiction—he executes his craft flawlessly with no internal friction or visible cost. The "affectionate detachment" feels asserted rather than embodied; his smile is "practiced" but we never see him genuinely tested or forced to choose between insight and empathy. Lira's arc is even thinner: she arrives weary, hesitates briefly, then accepts the vial with no meaningful resistance or transformation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's journey from calculating broker to compassionate actor shows clear motivation, but the transformation feels under-earned—her sudden emotional investment in Lila lacks the internal friction required at this length. The forged letter choice arrives without visible hesitation or cost, reading as benevolent impulse rather than a fraught decision that forecloses other paths. Interiority relies on abstract epiphany ("cycles of compassion...weren't grand gestures") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Secondary characters (Lila, the boardinghouse woman, the clerk) apply no meaningful resistance; they exist to receive Clara's actions rather than complicate them.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("boldly sympathetic," "webs of kinship") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to search for Veyra feels thematically motivated but lacks visceral cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The revelation that Lira is Veyra lands without prior tension between what Kael wants and what he fears, flattening the emotional stakes. Embodied emotion is present in "luminescent ache" but remains decorative rather than driving micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's motivation to document the canals is clear, and the pendant provides a concrete tool for agency. However, her decision to twist the pendant feels insufficiently earned—there's minimal internal conflict between curiosity and caution, and the stakes of "uncaging time" remain abstract until she's already inside the tunnel. The embodied reaction (gasping, stumbling) works, but the choice itself lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate it. The grandmother's backstory anchors present action adequately within BRR limits.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (solving her brother's riddle) and her "gently inventive" ritual shows character-particular action. However, the closure choice—touching the mosaic and feeling her brother's presence—lacks genuine cost or meaningful alteration; she arrives at acceptance without foreclosing a path. The reflection on her brother is substantial (~25% of text) but anchored to the present ritual. Internal contradiction is minimal; the shift from grief-as-void to grief-as-fractal reads as epiphany rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear—survival, protection of library patrons, pursuit of the tape's mystery—but her actions feel observational rather than constrained by contradictory impulses. The "kindly" trait is asserted through exposition ("her kindly nature emerged in her patience") without dramatizing a choice where kindness costs her something tangible. Interiority leans toward summary ("Her heart raced") and label-only emotion rather than embodied perception under pressure. The ending gesture—feeling "seen"—arrives as an epiphany without a visible forfeiture that earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her internal arc from control to release shows some embodied contradiction ("reluctance to change—her fear of losing control"). However, the epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than earned pressure; the hellebore's transformation happens *to* her while she watches passively. The final choice—"I'm going to help them by releasing control"—reads as declarative intention rather than a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. Interiority occasionally tips into therapy-speak ("transformation wasn't something to resist. It was something to *sustain*") without sufficient embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marin's motivation ("threshing meaning from experience") is clear and her insomnia and painting practice ground her artistic crisis, but her decision to follow the rain feels sudden rather than motivated by prior contradiction. The stranger's arrival and Marin's acceptance of the exchange lack internal resistance—no dramatized cost of accepting a magical brooch from a frayed ghost. The final smile and eased insomnia resolve her struggle too tidily, suggesting transformation without the visible forfeiture or endurance required at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("curiosity overpowering caution") and stock embodiment ("breath caught," "throat tighten"). Her choice to accept the pearl lacks internal contradiction or visible cost—she hesitates briefly but no competing value is dramatized. The pilgrim is atmospheric but flat, existing primarily as a thematic mouthpiece. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to compile fragments is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains thin—we see method more than contradictory impulse. The fisherman and young girl function as information vessels rather than pressure sources; their interactions feel transactional, not crucible moments that force Lirael to choose between competing goods. Embodied emotion is scarce; her reflective stance stays steady across all three sites without meaningful internal friction or visible cost to her patience.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias exhibits clear traits (meticulous mapper, analytical/artistic duality) but his motivations remain abstract—"fortress of unspoken truths" and the veiled woman feel decorative rather than viscerally rooted in lived stakes. The trembling certainty motif labels emotion more than it embodies contradiction; his micro-choices (following arrows, inserting the punch) read as puzzle-solving rather than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The woman's brief appearance and cryptic speech offer no relationship pressure, and Elias's final smile feels awarded rather than earned through internal conflict dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's skepticism and interior reflection are legible, but the emotional arc relies heavily on told transformation ("Aelia's courage seeped into her") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The "sympathetic skeptic" trait operates mostly in observation mode—she adjusts the telescope, descends, traces symbols—without decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The memory flood from Aelia provides context but arrives as received wisdom rather than through Clara's own embodied struggle, blunting agency at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's boredom and fear are embodied through concrete actions (tracing the fragment, breath hitching), and his final choice to press fragments together demonstrates contradictory impulses. However, the immortal's "mind that withered from boredom" is told rather than shown through accumulated micro-choices, and Lira materializes too late to develop genuine relationship pressure. The stakes shift from solo entrapment to joint escape within a single exchange, limiting the earned quality of the final leap. Internal conflict remains somewhat abstract despite the embodied moments.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (protect father, secure asylum) but her shift from hiding to confrontation feels unmotivated—no on-page pressure or micro-choice forces her to step out. The ink pot's "clarity" effect reads as convenient mind-reading without embodied cost or trade-off. Her confidence in the negotiation lacks internal friction or visible doubt under extreme stress. The agents' capitulation after one conversation spanning "the next hour" (told, not shown) undercuts earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    Althea's interiority is almost entirely abstract exposition about invented histories and time-collecting rather than embodied choices under pressure. The dominant emotional register is label-only ("earnestly studious," "trembled," "smiled") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment when the lamp's hum syncs with her breathing could generate tension, but she simply writes more stories without forfeiting anything or facing a dramatized cost. No genuine internal conflict or decision that narrows options appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("colors bled into hues only he saw") without embodied consequence or micro-choices that test his perceptual filter under pressure. The locket revelation lands cleanly, but the protagonist remains passive through most beats—collecting fragments rather than making choices that foreclose paths. Emotional states are declared ("his mind reeled") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The death-certificate mystery provides motivation, but internal contradiction and genuine struggle are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to solve the astronomer's riddle is clear, but her internal life remains largely abstract—she "mutters," "chuckles," "grins," without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The climactic moment when she plays the cello reads as external action rather than a struggle between her myth-busting skepticism and her need to believe; the shift from logic to empathy is declared ("solved...with empathy") rather than earned through on-page tension. Her professional identity as a "myth buster" is mentioned but never pressures a specific choice or creates friction with her chase of this legend.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation (preserve carnival soul vs. appease suits) is clearly stated but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The stone chip handling and graffiti decoding show purposeful action, yet her internal conflict feels summarized rather than lived—she moves smoothly from doubt to plan without visible cost or mistake. The final choice (standing before the Council) lacks a dramatized trade-off; the Council simply withdraws without Lira foreclosing a path or paying a price on the page. Jax and the vendors remain functional props rather than sources of immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to leave a mark is established, but her interior life reads more as thematic vehicle than embodied contradiction. The final choice to plant the vial is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; we're told she's "purposefully curious" and that she "ignored" the cold, but these remain labels without visceral cost or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The grandfather's wisdom arrives as inherited epigram rather than lived tension, and the ending's satisfaction feels preordained rather than wrested from genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's sensory perception through touch and heat signatures is well-embodied, and her repair methodology shows character-specific expertise. However, her internal conflict remains muted—the stakes of HB-7's failure never force a difficult choice or visible cost; she proceeds methodically without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths. The "embarrassed" reaction to Marlow's praise offers a micro-character note, but no contradictory impulses create pressure during the repair itself. Marlow functions primarily as exposition vessel rather than applying relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clara's motivations are established early—her belief that maps are promises and her drive to find where rivers begin. However, her arc from editor to mystic feels under-motivated; the shift from skeptical cartographer to someone who declares "rivers are alive" lacks sufficient interior resistance or contradiction. The final choice to send travelers north with dry wit reads as competence rather than a decision forged under pressure with visible cost. Jorn functions primarily as a sounding board rather than applying direct pressure to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("burned low but steady") but never tested by meaningful on-page conflict—he waits, tunes, and the town simply responds without resistance or internal contradiction. The interiority relies on declarative summary ("infinitely patient," "believed in revival") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The townsfolk appear only as gaunt onlookers whose transformation is described through external markers (a child laughs, an old woman weeps) without individual agency or friction. No felt cost forecloses a path; Kael walks away into success.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—she moves through the temple on rails. The vial-triggered memory flood (mother's lullaby, unseen shore, unworn crown) reads as ornamental rather than complicating her present choice. The final "letting go" arrives without visible cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath fogged," "pressure squeezing her ribs") and the epiphany about the temple being a memory-prison lacks prior character work to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior is often label-heavy ("throat tightened," "breath hitched") without embodied particulars. The father's ghost and the doppelgänger appear as plot devices rather than pressures that force Elias into contradictory impulses; his final decision to "write" feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices with visible cost. The lattice functions as a magic wand that sustains him without constraining his agency or revealing a hierarchy of values through trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    The ghost bride remains a symbolic vehicle rather than a character with interior contradictions acting under pressure. Her "motivation" is told in a backstory paragraph ("layered, a tapestry of grief and gratitude") but never forces a difficult on-page choice between competing goods. Elara is passive, discovering rather than deciding, and her final act—holding the bead aloft—feels like receiving a gift rather than paying a cost. The piece offers label-only interiority ("mournful elation," "loving and venomous") without embodied tension or a credible mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clearly stated but her interior life remains largely abstract—thread glows and she hums, yet we see little embodied struggle or contradictory impulse under pressure. The sleepwalker encounter offers a gesture toward connection but Lira's response (sewing a thread to the robe) reads symbolic rather than grounded in character-specific choice. Her final smile and "hauntingly optimistic" heart are told labels; the piece would benefit from showing the cost of her devotion through a micro-choice that reveals competing desires or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to restore faith is declared but interior contradiction remains thin—she doubts the elders yet presses on without visceral cost dramatized in scene. The choice to follow at the end ("She chose to follow") tells rather than showing a foreclosed alternative with embodied stakes. Reflection dominates the middle ("She thought of her grandmother…") without micro-choices that alter present tactics. Embodied emotion is present in "heart racing" but therapized phrasing like "warmly curious" and "cautious enchantment" reads label-only.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (the grandmother reveal), but her emotional arc feels telescoped—she moves from puzzle-solver to tearful heir without meaningful internal contradiction or visible struggle on the page. The chipboard's kinetic-energy gimmick and the arcade AI's programmed approval read as ornamental world-building rather than constraints that force hard choices. Micro-choices exist (kneeling to trace chalk, descending the staircase) but they advance plot without embodying competing impulses or demonstrable cost until the final tears, which arrive without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zara's motivation to "listen for unheard stories" and her embroidery work are established, but her internal contradiction remains largely decorative—the "disguising wisdom as foolishness" trait is asserted rather than tested through genuine micro-choices with visible cost. Jaxon's presence feels functional but his arc is minimal; he moves from thinking her foolish to seeing wisdom, yet this shift is told ("Now he saw the wisdom") rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice. The candle-synchronization moment is intriguing but Zara's agency reads more as demonstration than decision under pressure. No clear path is foreclosed with felt cost on the page; the ending gestures toward revelation without anchoring what Zara risks or renounces.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is stated clearly—seeking "the moment before deciding" and unspoken words—but her interior life relies heavily on label-only emotion ("throat tighten," "warmth in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift from "heavy" to "lighter" feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Backstory is woven throughout but functions primarily as exposition rather than tilting present stance through on-page choices. The character reads as a vehicle for the concept rather than a flawed individual whose blind spots drive mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on coined terms ("shrewdly innocent gaze," "lotus-hearted ache") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The translator role shapes perception selectively (coral grooves mirroring cast marks), but peak moments default to abstract emotional summary ("grief and tenderness coiled together") instead of simultaneous impulses in scene. The final coral-placement choice at the negotiating table arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed alternative—she simply acts, and delegates respond cooperatively. Micro-choices exist (tracing doodles, writing translations) but carry no trade-off pressure that would earn the ending's hopeful reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to rediscover lost joy is signaled early and her arc shows genuine progression from "quiet elegies" to "stubborn, glorious joy." The final choice to continue painting with bigger murals is earned by the evening's resurrection of community life. However, interiority sometimes lapses into abstraction ("fog had seeped into her bones") and the epiphany moment "she'd painted with hope" reads slightly diagnosed rather than embodied. Marla's recognition of her mother in the fresco provides strong emotional grounding, but secondary characters remain functional rather than fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marisol's interior is present but leans toward generic artisan-dreamer phrasing ("colors held memories," "methodically playful soul"). Her motivation to "awaken" the mural feels more told than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The grandfather backstory fragment anchors her curiosity but doesn't create visible internal friction. The final choice to "keep dancing" arrives without a felt trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is sketched with quirky traits (ink-stained fingers, poetry quotes) but these don't constrain choices under pressure. His motivations shift from academic curiosity to "standing guard" without embodied conflict between competing desires. The greenhouse sequence shows him performing tasks (releasing pheromones, scattering spores) but these feel like plot checkpoints rather than decisions with visible costs. Lillian remains largely instrumental, testing him rather than applying relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is present but remains primarily declarative rather than enacted through conflicted micro-choices. The insomnia dissolves offstage without on-page struggle or visible cost after centuries of pressure. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("shield" vs. "bridge") but not dramatized through simultaneous impulses acting in scene. The final stance—"shyly unstoppable certainty"—arrives without a credible forfeiture that closes off a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's caretaker role is embodied through precise actions (tracing the fissure, dismantling the chime, singing), but her interior life remains underexplored—motivations are asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to repair the chime feels thematically resonant yet arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths; she succeeds without struggle or sacrifice. The director's hologram functions as exposition rather than relational pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "chest tightened" and "heart both heavy and light" lean on stock physiology rather than character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and her work with languages embodied through concrete tasks (tracing spines, translating fragments). However, the character leans heavily on type—the ink-stained arcane linguist with a "carefully reckless" grin—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The translation work functions more as symbolic parallel than genuine struggle; Henrik's midnight question about vulnerability arrives as externalized therapy rather than emerging from Elara's own friction. The final phone call to Mira feels resolved too smoothly given years of silence, with no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation (harmonizing conflicting values) is stated but never dramatized as a contradiction acting in scene. Her "slyly heartfelt nature" appears only as a label; we see competence and method but no visible internal friction or cost when she pauses or proceeds. The final choice—reading the message aloud—feels like an arrival rather than a foreclosure with visible price. Interiority relies on abstract claims ("her mind raced") rather than embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's interior world is richly layered with contradictory impulses—romanticizing his grandfather while knowing the truth of fraud, serving dubious clients yet pursuing personal meaning. Embodied moments work well: trembling fingers on the harness, cross-legged listening to the tape. However, the final turn to pack and deliver the chip himself feels under-motivated; weeks of obsessive decoding collapse into a sudden decision without visible internal cost or a dramatized tipping point that earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's journey from fugitive to cartographer shows embodied stakes through grain-reading and code-deciphering, but her emotional progression feels overly composed. The final reunion with her father lacks contradictory impulses—relief and regret are stated rather than enacted through resistance or cost. "Featherly determined" appears as a label without constraining a choice. The protagonist's competence (analyzing grain, reading codes) never degrades under stress or leads to a costly mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's internal landscape is established through her observational stance and belief system, but her choices remain largely passive observation until the final gathering. The burnt feather functions more as symbolic token than driver of contradictory impulses. The other researchers exist as audience rather than pressure points—no relationship friction forces harder choices. The final "realization" about belonging reads as told insight rather than earned through dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks missing paths—but her interior life remains vague and label-dependent ("cheerful gloom," "regret...like molasses"). The transliteration process is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final realization ("paths were *released*") arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternative; Lira remains an observer. Embodied emotion and agency that alters tactics are absent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira is given analytical traits and a clear goal, but her internal life remains thin—mostly observational narration rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The crowd-manipulation sequence shows competence without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The teen's arrival and payment feel like validation rather than a choice that alters her stance. Embodied emotion is sparse; labels like "lightly attentive" and "analytical" do the work instead of dramatized micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirael's motivation (renewal of fading constellations) is declared but her interior life remains abstract and label-dependent. The dance sequences describe movement but lack embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("her heart full of obsidian grace") rather than dramatized through specific perception and action. The final choice to linger feels unearned because no prior scene shows her weighing competing costs or forfeiting a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly articulated ("to illuminate value in the mundane") but remains declarative rather than tested under pressure. Her actions—wading in, throwing a stone, observing ripples—are exploratory gestures without opposition or meaningful cost. The moment of "peace" and the notebook entry present an epiphany claimed rather than earned through struggle or trade-off. Internal contradiction is absent; she performs a ritual and finds exactly what she sought with no complicating impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's guilt over his squad's death and his mother's hourglass inheritance provide clear motivation, but interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("translate his pain into something universal") rather than embodied contradiction. The final acceptance—"You are not broken"—arrives through passive reception from the hourglass rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a path. Micro-choices are present (kneeling, opening the box, tipping the hourglass) but carry minimal visible cost; the transformation reads as received wisdom rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("puzzle out new equations for hope") is declared but never tested against competing desires or meaningful resistance. The "logical dreamer" trait remains label-only; we see her work methodically but no internal contradiction or blind spot that drives a mistake under pressure. The moment when she "understood" the grotto as crossroads arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized doubt or cost. The silver thread from her own hair is a gesture toward embodied choice, but it doesn't foreclose an option or reveal a hierarchy of values with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood memory, and her final choice to burn the film negative and take the locket shows agency. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("walls dream," "passage's face") without sharp internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic moments—placing the negative in the fireplace, finding the locket—feel more like symbolic gestures than choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes diluted by elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to persuade mirrors via song is established, but her interior life relies heavily on external labels ("perceptively calm demeanor") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed heartbeat locket provides emotional texture but her choices feel predetermined rather than torn; no genuine struggle between competing goods appears on the page. The sister's memory drives the work but doesn't create live friction—Lirael executes her plan smoothly without cost until exhaustion, which reads more as physical depletion than character transformation. The final walk-away lacks visible foreclosure of a path or renunciation with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is consistent and her micro-choices show clear pressure, particularly in guiding the delegates through tense negotiation beats. However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("the weight of her task felt heavier," "her heart heavy yet hopeful") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final act of packing the clipboard feels more like a ritual gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict remains largely told rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The philanthropist's contradictory impulses—engineering drought while treasuring the extinct bird's song—operate simultaneously on the page through the egg placement ritual and water vial gesture. Internal conflict is embodied in concrete actions (kneeling in salt, pouring river water) rather than therapy-speak. However, the character's motivation remains largely told through exposition ("drawn not by greed but by a secret sentimentality") rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to "move on to his next project" undercuts the cost of release, reading more as character summary than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear (defiance of conformity) and her bodily poetic form shapes the central action, but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. "She moved with deliberate grace, each step a sonnet" tells rather than dramatizes contradictory impulses. The character's choices feel inevitable rather than pressured by competing goods; the dance succeeds without meaningful risk or visible tradeoff on the page. The "chaste courtesan" designation reads ornamental—chastity never constrains a choice or generates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior monologue is concrete and specific ("his serifed verses smooth as lies"), and the tycoon eulogy backstory generates genuine moral tension. However, his transformation from complicit calligrapher to subversive artist feels more asserted than dramatized—the puppet show itself proceeds smoothly without internal contradiction or visible cost in the moment. The "uncommonly serene" attribute functions as a label rather than a constraint that shapes choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's interiority is heavily abstracted through concept-labels ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted existence") rather than embodied contradiction. The work of knotting silk is concrete, but her motives remain philosophical summary—"honor the overlooked histories"—never tested by competing wants or genuine cost. The moth's death and the monarch's arrival prompt emotional declaration ("chest tight," "heart full") without micro-choices that foreclose paths. No meaningful internal conflict or trade-off shapes the closure; she simply continues her self-assigned mission without alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through scarred hands and his history of casting bells, but interiority leans heavily on retrospective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in the present scene. The final moment with Lira materializing feels unmotivated—no prior dramatized cost or internal friction foreclosed a path to earn this reunion. "Technically gentle" appears twice as a label without constraining a choice. Emotional progression from grief to resolution lacks visible struggle; the rope simply works.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("precisely playful nature," "foresight matched only by hindsight") rather than embodied contradiction. The hologram sequence tells us she was "chosen" and explains her mind "dances between order and chaos," but we never see her make a micro-choice under conflicting impulses that costs her something on the page. The final walk outside feels declared rather than earned by prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. Therapy-speak and diagnostic self-awareness ("transcend," "integrate") flatten what should be crisis-driven embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's frugality is asserted repeatedly but rarely constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—she bartered wages off-screen, then operates without material friction. Internal life leans on stock phrasing: "her pulse quickened," "breath catching," "voice steadier than she felt." The tile-acceptance moment ("I'll honor it") arrives without dramatized conflict between competing wants; the mentor's death and her grief are told, not tested under present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and sustained, but her internal experience remains abstract—terms like "scheming pacifist" and "heart soft as moss" serve as labels rather than dramatized contradictions. The visitors (Elara, Kael) undergo identical epiphany arcs without distinct flaws or resistance patterns; their transformations feel mechanical rather than earned through individuated struggle. Embodied emotion is thin: reactions are summarized ("eyes glistening," "hand trembling") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Lirael's competence goes unchallenged, and no genuine mistake compounds pressure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows minimal internal contradiction; his decision to help is immediate and unexamined. The stranger remains label-only ("voice hoarse with urgency") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The synchronized breathing offers a gesture toward collaboration, but neither character's motives are tested by competing pressures or visible cost. The ending pivot—"boundaries…not to be erased, but to be navigated"—is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to persist and mend is stated clearly but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The hair ribbon is handled repeatedly, yet her micro-choices under pressure feel pre-determined rather than forced by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The "feisty" trait is asserted ("You're endearingly feisty") but never dramatized through a specific trade-off or mistake that compounds. Mara exists only in reflection and summary, flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's hunger to understand "hidden threads" drives her defiance of the board, and her bewilderment evolves toward acceptance. Internal contradiction is present—she "organizes chaos" but "crumbles" with her own past—but this remains largely asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. The final act of pressing the cameo to the tree reads as choice by inheritance logic, though the cost (what path is foreclosed?) remains vague. Embodiment is thin: "breath hitched" and "trembling hands" are stock gestures that do not anchor her particular emotional signature.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (decode dead tongues → rewrite life's work) is clearly stated early, but her characterization relies heavily on told competence ("carefully resourceful," "arcane linguist") rather than contradictory impulses shown in action. The moment she admits ignorance to the guardian represents growth, but the internal conflict between pride and humility needed more embodied texture during the journey. The "renegotiate" pivot feels functional yet somewhat externally imposed rather than emerging from a dramatized flaw or contradiction. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("acknowledge their ignorance") in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to find the garden is present, but her interior life leans heavily on stock body-language and label-only traits ("aberrant was her middle name"). The twin dynamic is introduced but never creates genuine internal friction—Veyra's skepticism dissolves too easily without cost. The final choice to plant their name feels unearned; no prior on-page struggle makes this renunciation or acceptance feel inevitable. Interiority at peak beats defaults to summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("translate chaos into order") is clearly stated, but her choices feel more procedural than conflicted. The discovery proceeds through her methodical competence without internal contradiction or genuine risk—she works steadily, the door opens, she copies a scroll. Interiority relies on stock descriptors ("heart pounding," "breath visible") and the final transformation into "weaver of timelines" reads as a declared epiphany rather than one earned through visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and her actions track consistently through the narrative. Interiority leans toward the abstract ("her mind was still," "ribs ache") rather than contradictory embodied impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to place the bloom feels ordained by the premise rather than earned through internal conflict with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's retrocognitive gift provides a character-particular mechanism, and her bleeding hands and exhaustion ground the struggle. However, the emotional progression at key beats relies on label-heavy interiority ("stubborn hope," "fragile alchemy of hope and memory") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to slam the shard feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior micro-choices, and the survivors' arrival soft-resets the emotional cost within paragraphs of the rekindling.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's interior is specific and embodied in places ("preemptively nostalgic" yields concrete sensory engagement with the forecourt), but the arc from passive recorder to "living part" of memory feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic realization—"To sculpt identity from experience wasn't about holding onto the past—it was about letting it shape you"—reads as clean epiphany without visible cost or a path foreclosed. Mid-scene micro-choices (kneeling, measuring, pausing) register but don't alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is concrete (outrunning guilt from the scarred children) and her mentor's lessons guide her choices. The chanting habit embodies her loneliness and becomes purposeful by the end. However, her interior voice slides into elevated register during peak moments ("Filter the world through its flame") that feels imposed rather than organic to a wandering artisan. The final laugh and transformation arrive without sufficient intermediate cost or contradiction—she moves from guilt to defiance too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is consistently filtered through her chronicler's observational stance, with embodied choices (placing the cicada, approaching Kael). However, the motivation remains somewhat abstract—"discover the texture of time" never faces a concrete cost that would make her turn away from it. The argument with Kael supplies external pressure, but her internal contradiction (chronicler's distance vs. relational need) is told more than dramatized in simultaneous conflict. Kael remains a pressure-source rather than a fully realized secondary character with his own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation to collect "flavors of different silences" is established but remains abstract—she never wrestles with competing impulses or a genuine choice that costs her something internal. The doll loss registers emotionally and the sprout discovery shows change, but the arc feels more like acceptance than earned transformation through contradictory desires acting simultaneously. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("silence tasted of honey and old wood") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The father remains functional but applies no relational pressure that forces Lila into a values hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated abstractly ("teach silence how to comfort") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "method was fluidly logical" arrives as a label without showing tactical choices constrained by competing needs. The vial-watching sequence feels observational rather than choice-driven; the epiphany ("silence itself was speaking") lands as sudden insight rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Interior voice relies on elevated diction ("vaulting hush," "catalyze a solution") that reads more authorial than gondola-operator particular.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration ("wisely adventurous—a paradox forged by decades") rather than embodied contradiction in action. Her climb features declared fear ("Fear was a luxury she couldn't afford") but no visible cost or micro-choice that forecloses a path until the ending. The guardian encounter resolves through insight rather than dramatized internal conflict, and the final realization feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's core motivation—isolation-turned-reconnection—reads clearly, and the bridge-burning backstory anchors her current choice. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("weight that pressed against her chest," "teach suffocating to breathe") rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's presence provides a relationship crucible, but his reaction feels underwritten; the final握手 and collaborative stance arrive without visible internal resistance or cost that would elevate the change from functional to deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's backstory as a "pyramid scheme survivor turned mycologist" provides motivation, but her interior life remains thin—choices like turning the bolt feel prompted by external messages rather than embodied conflict. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Dr. Voss materializes as a stock manic scientist without applying meaningful interpersonal pressure. The ending smile and grin read as performed confidence rather than earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to uncover truth is clear and her interiority shows embodied tension ("tremor in her chest," crying at discovery). However, the character remains at arm's length—her specific personality beyond "last heir seeking secrets" never crystallizes through distinct micro-choices or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The father's ghost and ancestors blur into generic regret without individuated friction. The final choice to "build something new" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cedric's motivation crystallizes partway through ("capture the shape of possibility"), but his interior texture relies heavily on abstract mysticism and borrowed phrases rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from trauma-silent knight to laughing, glowing figure lacks intermediate micro-choices showing how unsnapping strings changes his relationship to control or loss. Emotions are often labeled ("shivering bliss," "dread and euphoria") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene. The final laugh feels declared rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is grounded in embodied detail (breath catching, heart stuttering) and his archivist's lens shapes perception throughout. The opening backstory block (~15%) anchors in present dust patterns and primes his magnifying impulse at closure. Internal contradiction is thin—his hopeful belief never meets meaningful resistance—and the final act (opening a fresh folder, beginning to write) feels more like documentation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The button-handling beats show micro-choices, but they don't narrow options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's resourcefulness is demonstrated through concrete choices (memorizing patrol routes, decoding chatter, using the puddle-map trick), but her interior life remains thin—emotions are largely labeled ("heart pounded," "jaw tightened") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The father backstory arrives as efficient setup but doesn't tilt a present choice with visible cost. Jax functions primarily as sounding board; their dynamic applies no meaningful pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods. The final smile feels unearned—no on-page struggle between her drive and a credible counter-pull that would make holding the line cost something specific.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear and drives his actions, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract formulations ("eerie nostalgia," "liminal space," "vested hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother's deathbed warning provides backstory anchor, yet Elias's present choices feel more like executing a ritual than wrestling with competing impulses. His final peace arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply walks away lighter, which undercuts the renunciation that Earned Stasis would require. Embodied emotion is present in "lungs burning" and "shoulders slumping," but the resolution lacks the felt trade-off that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elinor's motivation to decode falling leaves is clear and her choice to build monuments is on the page, but her interior life remains thin—we see precision and dedication without genuine contradiction or embodied struggle. The final sequence (gather silverseed, warn others, seek Lirael) reads as a to-do list rather than a foreclosing choice with visible cost. Emotional states are largely asserted ("mossy delight") rather than embodied through perception and action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by obsession with the compass and driven by a desire to impose order, then discovers acceptance of uncertainty. The arc from "fixing clocks, imposing order" to "let the gears turn freely" is present but feels more stated than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final workshop choice (planting clockwork flowers) arrives abruptly without prior struggle between control and release that would make the shift inevitable. Interiority leans toward summary ("He'd expected answers") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior life shows contradictory impulses—torn between logic and mysticism, searching versus accepting limits—but the interiority leans heavily on stock metaphor ("balance was a fragile thing") and label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in micro-choices. The final acceptance of cracks reads slightly declarative rather than earned through prior micro-decisions under pressure. Lira's translucent form and her articulation of theme ("balance isn't about equal parts") borders on sermon rather than dramatized struggle. The renunciation is present but the path to it feels somewhat externalized rather than emerging from contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("modestly fearless," "quiet resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The encounter with the spectral figure forces one meaningful admission ("I fear that laughter is not enough"), but the closure choice—stepping forward with the tooth—arrives without visible cost or internal conflict in the moment. The figure itself remains a voice rather than a pressuring presence, and Lira's emotional arc from heaviness to lightness reads as declaration rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is given concrete proprioceptive feedback and trauma markers, but interiority leans heavily on abstract label-speak ("mathematics of mercy," "ultraviolet penance") rather than embodied contradiction. The woman's arrival feels convenient rather than causally motivated, and her touch triggers feedback without dramatizing a competing impulse or cost. The final choice to walk deeper reads as declarative mood shift rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path. Therapy-adjacent phrasing in peak beats ("Let the trauma teach you," "rewire you") flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The weaver appears only to dispense exposition; their exchange lacks genuine pressure or status friction. Interior life relies on stock phrasing: "chest tightened," "comfort, a reminder," "thought half-formed." The final choice to retrieve the fragment arrives without visible cost or a decision that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivations are stated but never genuinely tested—he "listens" to ghosts and "analyzes" dust, yet no micro-choice forces him to pay a visible price or foreclose an option. The clown ghost's "Thank you" at the end is told, not earned through any dramatized internal conflict or trade-off. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weightless burden pressing against his chest") and label-speak ("skillfully observant") without embodied contradiction. The protagonist operates as a mystic technician who understands immediately rather than struggling, flattening agency into convenient omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to "compress eternity" and "awaken something older" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The patrons remain abstract—"scholars and seekers"—without distinct voices or pressure applied to Elara. Her final smile and stepping into the storm read as declarative satisfaction rather than a choice with visible cost or internal friction. The piece tells us she fulfilled her "cryptic purpose" but does not show her foreclosing another path or enduring a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared ("to reimagine an entire civilization") but his interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The plan to cover mirrors reads as poet-archaeologist whimsy rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. His final speech ("You see? The Luminari didn't build this. They buried it.") is thesis-statement delivery, not embodied choice with visible cost. The ending grants him victory without foreclosing a path or showing what he sacrificed to plant those seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established but remains largely external (summoned, instructed by the covenant). His insight about the widow's husband's dishonesty drives the resolution, yet the protagonist feels more like a wise facilitator than someone with contradictory impulses under pressure. Lira's admission provides the key turn, but it arrives through Elias's prompting rather than dramatized internal struggle. The widow's crumpling face offers embodied emotion, but the repairman's calm competence throughout bypasses genuine mistakes or visible cost to his own stance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to explore the caves is clear and her psychometry trait is established, but her internal experience remains somewhat generic—"felt a prickle of curiosity," "hands trembling." The final realization ("she'd tasted the edge of the unknowable") reads as abstract epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to collect samples and leave is credible but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply returns enriched, with no dramatized renunciation or struggle that alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" reads as abstract theme-speak rather than visceral want. Her interior life relies heavily on label-only description ("perpetually learning brain raced") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy under pressure. The grandmother encounter and her shift to "weaver of timelines" arrive without prior internal conflict to make the transformation credible. The final moment shows her understanding the sculptures' meaning, but no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is present but often conveyed through abstract statements ("restless energy that coiled in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "smile" feels unmotivated after the compressed journey—no visible cost forecloses a path. Her obsession with the postcards drives the plot but her actual choices (climbing scaffolding, tracing patterns, painting shadows) lack genuine stakes or trade-offs that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's retrocognitive gift is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to descend feels obligatory rather than earned by visible internal conflict—we're told "her own identity fraying" but see no on-page micro-choices that show this cost altering her tactics. The final emergence with blank diary pages offers no legible transformation or renunciation with felt price; the protagonist simply executes plot moves without embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" is declared but remains abstract; his on-page choices (scavenging, arranging artifacts) feel more curatorial than driven by contradictory impulses. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("eyes sunken from years of mixing elixirs that never quite worked") and the final transformation happens to him rather than through a hard-won choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; the tears at the end feel unearned because we haven't seen him struggle with a genuine internal conflict that his method forces him to confront.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elder Voss's motivation to "archive emotional patterns" is stated but remains abstract; his interior life during the phonograph moment shows embodied attention (trembling fingers, spine tightening) but the epiphany—"not disaster, but awakening"—arrives without sufficient dramatic struggle or contradiction. The memory of children's faces and tree's pulse provides texture, yet no micro-choice under pressure tests his values or forecloses a visible path. The final smile and resolve feel asserted rather than earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael's motivation ("discover the texture of borrowed time") is asserted rather than rooted in scene pressure, and her interior reads as a vehicle for world-building rather than contradictory impulse. The "furiously tranquil" label is declared but never embodied in a micro-choice that shows competing drives in action. The grandmother's voice and the creature's hiss offer texture, but Lirael herself remains static—her actions proceed without visible internal friction or hierarchy of values under test. The ending laugh feels unearned; no prior beat dramatized the cost or forfeiture that would make wild joy legible.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira demonstrates clear professional competence and curiosity, with embodied reactions ("her brow furrowing," "her mind racing"). However, interiority relies on stock phrases ("her humble nature resisting the praise") and the climactic choice to alternate bell-ropes feels mechanically problem-solving rather than emotionally costly. Internal conflict is present but never forces a genuine trade-off with visible personal stakes. The mentor's arrival conveniently guides the resolution, reducing Lira's agency at the key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Zara's motivation ("find strength in vulnerability") is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a credible on-page choice with cost. The journey to the crater unfolds without internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path—she walks, kneels, and returns, all frictionless. Veyra's softening at the end reads as convenience rather than earned change. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical claims ("the flourishing stillness she sought") instead of embodied contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his astonishment at ghosts is embodied, but his interior life remains generalized. The decades-long silence and sudden speech at the end lack contradictory impulses acting in scene; the shift reads as linear enlightenment rather than genuine internal conflict. His "tranquilly perceptive" stance never creates a visible mistake or friction. The final choice to speak feels declarative rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias exhibits clear motivation (rediscovering time's texture) rooted in his banker past and grief over his wife, with the urn fragment anchoring embodied emotion. However, his internal arc relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "understanding" arrives through declarative insight ("He understood now") rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Therapy-speak intrudes at the climax ("texture of time passing," "mosaic of moments"), flattening what should be a pressured discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior is present but largely static—she observes, gathers, arranges, hums—without contradictory impulses or stakes-driven micro-choices that foreclose options. Her "warmly attentive" handling of the feather and her belief in harmonizing discord remain label-level; no on-page friction tests commitment or generates visible cost. The fisherman's silent nod and her smile register as sentiment rather than embodied pressure. Motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicting desires under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through her tactile work with copper and oak, but interiority tilts diagnostic at times ("She'd learned long ago that haste fractured more than stone"). The spirit interaction at dusk demonstrates contradictory impulses—her calm against its pain—but the terminal moment opts for serenity over earned struggle. The six-month timeline should impose visible physical decline or difficult micro-choices under duress; instead competence remains smooth. Internal contradiction exists but doesn't sufficiently complicate the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's skepticism and obsession are clearly established, and her interiority moves from intellectual resistance to embodied longing at the end. The final beat—"her skepticism unravel like a frayed rope"—shows internal shift, but the change feels asserted by spectacle rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Kael functions primarily as exposition vehicle; her copper skin and mercury eyes are ornamental labels rather than pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's interiority is filtered through vivid physical work and his soldier-to-gardener arc, but remains somewhat distant—we see his actions and hear his beliefs stated rather than experiencing contradictory impulses in real time. The smile at the end ("a rare gesture") is told rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal what he's renouncing or gaining. The bird-language skill and grandmother backstory feel more like résumé lines than lived constraints that force a difficult choice on the page. The final whisper carries thematic weight but doesn't foreclose a path with visible cost; we don't see what he's traded or what he now cannot do.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Hush's motivation to "translate distance into closeness" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The cylinder-solving sequence shows competence without genuine struggle or meaningful cost that forecloses options. Jeb and the elders remain functional props; no relationship pressure forces choices. The final "love" answer arrives as assertion rather than earned through on-page renunciation or embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elio's interiority is well-developed with specific perceptual details (meteorite ink, temporal stretching), but the grandmother apparition arrives without prior setup of Elio's relationship to grief or memory, making the emotional stakes feel declared rather than earned. The final choice to descend feels more like thematic necessity than character-driven contradiction—no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the decision. Embodied emotion is present in the palm-press and trembling hand, but the piece leans toward contemplative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's interior is label-heavy ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The swapping sequence shows competence but minimal internal conflict or hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final self-designation ("guardian of wonder, sacredly playful") reads as therapeutic self-summary rather than earned stance crystallization. Emotional progression is smooth and celebratory without credible friction or ambiguity that would charge the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared (historian of small gestures, survivor seeking to document) but her on-page choices remain abstract—pacing patterns and approaching a chessboard without meaningful internal conflict or trade-offs. The scars and "benevolently ruthless" labels exist as descriptors rather than constraining action. Emotional interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("quiet weight," "heart racing") and the final realization that she is "the pawn, the king, the board itself" feels like a declared epiphany rather than one earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's mercury-glass nature remains largely ornamental; her pain around memories is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The climactic moment—feather to stone, transformation—lacks visible internal conflict; she "welcomes" pain without prior resistance shown on the page. Secondary characters (Orin, the mother's voice) apply no immediate relational pressure. Micro-choices exist (climbing to the attic, pressing the feather) but the stakes feel declarative rather than tested through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alaric's motivation to forgive himself is established early and his internal conflict—guilt versus redemption—drives key choices. However, the resolution feels unearned: the epiphany "some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new" arrives through passive reflection rather than a difficult on-page choice that tests competing impulses. The prince memory is vivid but the pivot from self-blame to acceptance lacks dramatized cost or friction. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("mistakes were moves, not endings") without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is signaled early (desire to refract truth), but his internal life remains thin—he's more a vehicle for the concept than a contradictory consciousness. The gesture toward "innocently mischievous" is label-only; no micro-choice dramatizes the tension between defiance and playfulness with visible cost. The elders are stock antagonists without individuation, and the old woman's "fury softened into something like curiosity" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized perception shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats tell us Kael feels light or defiant without anchoring those states in specific bodily sensation or irrational impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's uncertainty is asserted but her choices feel thematically driven rather than arising from competing impulses in scene. The statue dialogue ("You think meaning can be conjured?") reads as externalized interior debate rather than a second consciousness. Her final respirator-removal and laughter feel like poetic gestures serving theme rather than motivated by prior causality—no on-page pressure compels her to risk acid fumes at that moment. Memories of mother's quilts and father's hymns arrive as backstory fragments that color the present but don't visibly constrain her next micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("the world was fraying, and so was he") rather than embodied contradiction. The cave journey shows some micro-choices (choosing the left path, placing the shell), but the pivotal moment—seeing his mother's face in the pool—arrives without prior internal conflict between competing impulses. The final change reads as relief rather than renunciation with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to prove whispers over shouts is dramatized through concrete action (humming, exhaling intent), and her fear/uncertainty is embodied in trembling hands and tears. The backstory about her parents' grief versus rage is efficiently conveyed and tilts her present choice. However, Thalos's sudden shift from threatening "what in the name of the tides" to grinning mentor feels unmotivated, and the fisherman/wife reaction at the end lacks specificity—we see them pause and feel warmth, but no distinct cost or trade-off emerges from their response.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her navigator identity is embodied through specific actions (tracing etchings, building the antenna), but her interiority relies heavily on label-level emotion ("heart racing," "tears streaking"). The grandmother's voice provides external pressure, yet Mara's choices feel more obedient than conflicted—she follows instructions without visible internal friction or trade-offs. The final smile and certainty undercut the potential cost of her journey; no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is stated but never tested through competing goods or visible tradeoffs. Her decisions feel scripted rather than pressured—slipping the glass eye into her socket to elicit truth from Jorn proceeds without internal resistance or cost. The relationship with Jorn shifts from paranoid to collaborative in a single scene without earned friction. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("her heart sinking," "her mind racing") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows some interior specificity (the nest of silver and seaweed beard, his eccentric habits), but his core motivation—borrowed memories—remains abstract and exposition-heavy rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The woman's grief over her daughter's stolen memories carries weight, yet her sudden appearance and instant confession flatten what could be a more gradual reveal earned through resistance. The final choice ("I'll return them") arrives without visible struggle or cost on the page; Elias simply declares his mission rather than dramatizing the renunciation or forfeiture that would anchor Earned Stasis. Backstory about his vanished wife and decades of study occupies substantial real estate without tilting a present micro-choice until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("the lingering promise...kept her awake") rather than embodied contradiction. The vision with her father offers concrete micro-choices, but the cavern discovery sequence feels more like passive receipt than agency under pressure. Emotional progression is largely summary ("heartbeat syncing with the drip") without the messy irrationality that would elevate mid-band execution. The final choice to pocket the chip and return home lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The queen's motivation to end her dreams and feel again is established, but her internal contradiction remains mostly stated rather than acted in scene—she claims disenchantment yet climbs eagerly without meaningful cost until the figure lectures her. The final turn (understanding and climbing down) lacks embodied hesitation or visible price; the epiphany arrives via exposition rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward label-only ("disenchanted," "afraid") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is legible—"The palette of resolve isn't a tool—it's a philosophy"—but her realization arrives via declaration rather than a dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The interiority leans on abstract metaphor ("scientifically romantic," "density of presence") without embodied contradiction; she moves from forcing the shell's resonance to "letting it guide the process" without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Jorin serves as mirror and messenger but exerts no independent pressure that forces Elara to trade off values. The final choice feels narrated rather than earned through visible internal conflict at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia," jealousy of past selves, jaded wonder—but the protagonist largely observes and reflects rather than making charged micro-choices under pressure. The scroll-reading and climb unfold as discovery beats, not genuine dilemmas that force contradictory impulses into collision. The final "bittersweet clarity" is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized trade-off with visible cost. Internal contradiction is promised but not sufficiently shown in a moment where competing desires force a genuine sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority is detailed but floats at one diagnostic remove—"fractured perception," "emotional terrain"—without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The climactic recognition (Eleanor as miracle) is told through clever deduction rather than earned through conflicted choice with visible cost. Mrs. Voss remains off-page, reducing relationship pressure to inference. Minor: "humanize the inanimate" and "occluded views" read as thematic labels rather than character-specific cognition under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's internal contradiction (fear vs. desire to prove himself) is present but largely told through retrospective summary rather than dramatized in scene. The scars-as-map conceit and the mentor's lessons dominate interiority, yet the peak choice—carving the rune—feels more like executing a plan than a genuine crossroads with visible cost. Embodiment is solid ("hands trembled," "chest tightened"), but the final transformation lacks the friction of a hard-won renunciation or forfeiture; he sheds doubt cleanly without on-page struggle at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clara's interior voice shows controlled specificity ("regret was her currency"), and the final choice to guide Elias through completion feels earned by her professional stance. However, the sister Lila remains a narrative convenience rather than a felt presence, and Clara's motivation shifts from skeptical exorcist to metaphor-wielding facilitator without visible internal friction. Elias's guilt is declared rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Witness remains an abstract cipher throughout, defined by cosmic labels rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority consists of philosophical summary ("understanding that truth was not a destination") without concrete micro-choices under pressure. The "journey inward while walking out" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist achieves peace without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lorn's interiority is specific and embodied through the key and counting ritual, with clear motivation driving him toward understanding the clocks' deeper meaning. His final realization that clocks measure longing arrives cleanly, though the emotional cost of this insight remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt in the body or subsequent choice. The grandfather's aphorisms anchor motivation but trend toward thematic convenience. Interior monologue is concrete and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, with the squinting and key-handling providing consistent physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's contradiction—probability professor's daughter turned compulsive gambler—is established but functions more as backstory label than live tension. Her choice to follow the scrawl clues and board the subway car shows agency, but the emotional arc from grief to "visit her father" feels unearned; the closure pivot lacks the compounding internal friction needed to make renunciation or endurance credible. Embodied emotion is present (heart racing, throat tightening) but interiority often defaults to abstract musings about contradictions rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father's absence drives motivation but the final tear-mixing moment reads as sentiment assertion rather than choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interiority is labeled rather than dramatized—"cultivated estrangement" and "melodically haunted" read as prompt echoes, not lived psychology. The callers dissolve into interchangeable vessels for thematic lessons; David's grief about Lila and the child's tears function as narrative props without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final smile and finger-tracing gesture feel performative rather than earned by prior struggle, and the protagonist never faces a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to preserve the covenant through small moments is clear and consistent, but her interior life lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she never wavers or doubts her method in scene. The locket photo triggers reflection but no micro-choice that alters her present stance; she simply continues her ritual. Embodied emotion is present ("edges warm against her thigh") but the peak moment—painting the locket with ink—feels more symbolic than conflicted. The character endures rather than changes, which qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost of this persistence isn't made visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is given occupational color ("disaster-relief logistician") and a quirk ("desperately jocular"), but both remain labels rather than shaping on-page choices. His motivations are declared ("cure for loneliness") yet never face a genuine internal conflict or trade-off; he follows Lira's instructions without meaningful resistance. The final "chest didn't ache as much" is asserted relief rather than earned transformation through prior contradiction. Lira functions as exposition delivery rather than applying relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his blind perception creates a distinct filter, but his actions flow too smoothly without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses. The mother's appearance at the end feels unearned—no prior choices forecast this literal reunion, and the "memory made flesh" device introduces a late rule without grounding. Internal conflict is asserted ("grief and hope coiled") rather than dramatized through competing wants that force difficult trade-offs. The ring's mechanics remain consistent but his competence never stumbles in ways that reveal deeper character limits.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's guilt over the blight provides clear motivation, and his shift from "editing is control" to "collaboration" is signaled. However, the change arrives via Lira's exposition rather than through embodied struggle; his peak choice—to apologize and listen—feels compliant rather than contradictory. Internal conflict remains mostly told ("guilt gnawed at him") instead of acted in scene. The mantra "confidently uncertain" is label-only and never constrains a specific micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to translate silence into music is stated but never tested against competing needs or believable obstacles. His "quietly charismatic presence" remains label-only; we see no micro-choices where his manner enables or constrains action with cost. Lira's arc from skepticism to collaboration occurs too smoothly—her interiority is thin, her shift unmotivated by internal contradiction. The crowd's emergence and rapt attention feel convenient rather than earned through prior character work.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation (grandmother's promise) is stated rather than tested under pressure. Her actions trace a predetermined path without internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses options. The "analytically intuitive" label appears once without constraining a choice. Emotion is described ("tears streaming") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV shift from third-person Eli to first-person "I" mid-story creates head-hopping confusion that undermines characterization. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("auroral sorrow," "entangled memories") rather than concrete, embodied perception. The protagonist's motivation—"to breathe life into a shared dream"—is asserted by a secondary character rather than dramatized through Eli's choices under pressure. The "quietly rebellious" trait manifests only as drumming, without visible cost or internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his sensory engagement (trembling hands, ozone taste) grounds him physically. However, his interior life trends toward metaphor and sensory inventory rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he remains competent and observant throughout without genuine struggle or blind spots forcing mistakes. The final claim "the labyrinth didn't need maps. It needed whispers" reads as a declared insight rather than one earned through dramatized cost or renunciation. The supporting cast (Voss, the haulers) apply pressure only as backdrop; no relationship forces a choice that alters state.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's interiority is nearly absent; we receive her title and attribute as labels ("spiralingly calm") but no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure. The fisherman's question is deflected by silence, but Lira never wrestles with competing desires or costs—she simply executes her ritual. Her "motivation" to "teach darkness the value of stars" reads as abstract thesis rather than dramatized want, and no foreclosed path or visible cost emerges from her actions. The cat's appearance and the fisherman's departure register no internal conflict or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation to coach chess as "quiet rebellion against the idea that grief must paralyze" reads as label-speak rather than embodied struggle. Her supernatural ability to "hear unspoken words" operates inconsistently—sometimes literal telepathy, sometimes metaphor—without cost or constraint shaping her choices. Lila's arc from *I'm alone* to *I'm learning* is told through italicized thought-tags rather than dramatized through resistant behavior that shifts. The final exchange about "planting forests" feels like mutual articulation of the theme rather than contradictory impulses acting under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear—escape from the island—but her interior life consists largely of summarized emotional states ("felt a surge of recognition," "strange, liberating calm") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The key decision to release the scrimshaw feels unmotivated by prior on-page pressure; she simply knows "what she had to do" without dramatized conflict. The final transformation is declared ("someone new—someone free") rather than earned through visible cost or forfeited path. Backstory about her father and childhood diving remains ornamental, priming nothing that alters her present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's interior life is enacted through the whittling ritual, but her blankness as a trait flattens rather than complicates her choices—there's no visible internal contradiction or competing impulse within the carving scene itself. The backstory exposition (mandate enforcement, lost family) is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is present in the crumbling petals and steady knife work, but the performance conceit keeps her at a distance; the final whispered line about carrying darkness feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirael remains conceptually abstract throughout, with motivation stated ("aesthetically driven," "craved dissolution of boundaries") rather than enacted through embodied conflict. Her "aesthetic drive" never collides with a competing need or cost that would force a choice with consequence. The climactic moment—stepping onto liquid glass—reads as wish fulfillment rather than earned transformation; no prior action forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses. Interiority consists largely of label-only feelings ("heart racing," "tremor of certainty") and therapy-adjacent constructions ("sacred and profane might blur") that announce states without embodying them in perception or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows coherent motivation (painting beauty in imperfection post-phoenix), but his "innocently cunning" acceptance of Marla's trade reads label-only; no on-page cunning micro-choice appears. Marla remains static—her backstory revelation doesn't emerge from contradictory impulses, just exposition. The moth and plant awakening feel decorative rather than embodied struggle; Elias's climactic "I've just started to see" lands flat because prior interiority was abstract ("hauntingly empty," "obsession") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal conflict is told, not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clearly stated ("yearned to discover the texture of connection"), but her choices feel more reactive than driven by internal contradiction. The cave discovery sequence shows embodied perception ("skin prickled"), yet the final bell-ringing feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. Dr. Voss remains functional but applies minimal pressure. Interior voice lacks character-particular texture—"powerfully gentle" is repeated as a mantra rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (atonement for failing to save his wife) is clear and his ritual work is embodied through concrete actions—folding origami, lighting lanterns, tracing the stencil. However, his interior remains largely declarative rather than contradictory; the prose tells us he "sought to redeem himself" without showing impulses that pull against this goal. The final turn—wearing the pendant and understanding rock bottom as foundation—arrives as epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle. Emotional progression reads as smooth ascent without the irrational friction that would raise the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("steadily curious," "hunger") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The teaching moment with Mara shows micro-choices, but the protagonist's agency reads more as exposition of method than genuine conflict between competing desires. Embodied emotion is present in gestures (tape unspooling, cards laid), yet the climactic choice to "rebuild" feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle with visible cost. Mara's arc from frayed developer to cross-legged student proceeds too smoothly without internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear—she pursues forbidden knowledge—but her interior voice is marred by abstract phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia clung to ruins like lichen") that reads ornamental rather than embodied. The confrontation with Kael offers a brief glimpse of contradiction (her sworn method versus the archive's pull), but the conflict dissolves without forcing a micro-choice that constrains her path. The final gesture of walking deeper is more declaration than earned renunciation; no visible cost forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to preserve hope is signaled early but her decision-making feels more passive curator than active agent—she follows Thalos's guidance rather than generating choices through internal contradiction. The "softly deliberate" trait appears as label without constraining action; her emotional embodiment defaults to generic gestures ("grip tightened," "eyes wet with tears"). The transformation at closure lacks visible personal cost; she restores hope through a discovered word rather than a renunciation or trade-off that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's journey from betrayal to reconstructed purpose is coherent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The chameleon metaphor does meaningful work, yet key moments lean on therapy-adjacent language ("balance self-respect and compassion," "shedding layers") that flattens the emotional stakes. The final choice—reconstructing the tail as a symbolic act—reads more as enacted metaphor than a high-cost decision that forecloses a live path. Micro-choices in the workshop are present but lack the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to decode her mother's death drives her into the tower, but her interior life leans heavily on label-speak ("raw and hyperaware," "accidentally telepathic") without embodied contradiction. The scar functions more as thematic device than lived constraint—she never makes a micro-choice shaped by physical pain or limitation. The final "smile, her heart light" resolves grief too tidily without visible renunciation or ongoing cost, undercutting the earned-stasis claim.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's gift of "spatial imagination" is labeled but never shown constraining a choice; it functions as flavor text. The psychometry reading produces vivid backstory images but Mara makes no difficult decision under pressure—she simply witnesses Elise's past, then decides to "find" the love with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Elise and Thomas are vivid in flashback, but their drama remains sealed in the past; Mara's present-tense emotional arc (throat tightens, tears prick) is summarized rather than embodied in contradictory action. The final whisper "I'll find you" and the smile are declarations of intent without on-page stakes or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to free trapped creativity is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternate path. His "moonstruck dreamer" trait functions as label-only; we observe him adjusting instruments and experiencing visions, but no internal contradiction forces a decision under pressure. The stardust flood at the climax is received passively—he kneels, laughs, stands—without a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The ending resets him to chase the aurora again, foreclosing no live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's dreamlessness is established but functions primarily as a trait label rather than a lived contradiction that drives choices under pressure. The moment he "becomes occasionally everywhere" and finally dreams reads as an unearned epiphany—no prior micro-choices show him wrestling with the cost of dreamlessness or building toward that capacity. The woman functions as a guide-dispensary rather than a pressure source, and her motivations remain opaque. Embodied emotion is thin; most feelings are declared ("chest ached") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior life reads thin—discovery happens to her more than through her active struggle. The father-as-hologram beat offers exposition rather than embodied conflict. "Let go" arrives as告知 wisdom without prior contradictory impulses forcing that renunciation on the page. The smile at the end feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira and Jorin show distinct character textures—Lira's calm authority versus Jorin's apprentice uncertainty—and their relationship creates pressure through teaching dynamics. Micro-choices appear (Lira placing the punch on the stone, Jorin learning to watch shadows) but internal contradiction is minimal; both characters arc smoothly toward acceptance without messy struggle. The final choice to "wait for the next leash to break" feels more like arriving at a predetermined lesson than foreclosing a genuine path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward wise-guide platitudes ("courage isn't a lake to be drained") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elric's motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") is established but remains abstract until late in the piece. His decision to speak emerges suddenly after the staircase stain moment without clear causal buildup showing why this particular incident forces the shift. The internal contradiction between silence-as-virtue and silence-as-contract is told rather than dramatized through competing impulses in scene. Lady Veyra's fury and the guests' reaction provide some external pressure, but Elric's transformation feels more thematic than earned through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Veyra's motivation is declared but never tested by internal conflict or meaningful choice. She moves through the library and chamber with competent ease, encountering no mistakes, hesitation, or genuine friction between want and cost. The pretender and courtiers remain stock figures without pressure or distinct voice. The ending grants her recognition without visible sacrifice or alteration—she was already the heir, and the story delivers symmetric satisfaction without foreclosing any option.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mosaic of grief," "drumbeat of defiance") rather than embodied contradiction. Her tapping practice is asserted as meaningful but never shown constraining a choice or revealing internal conflict in action. The final decision to follow the path lacks visible cost—no demonstrated sacrifice or foreclosed option grounds the choice. Kael appears only to validate her findings, applying no genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's "awkwardly confident" trait is mostly label-only; her actual choices (pressing stones, orchestrating the ritual) read confident without visible awkwardness constraining them. Interior work remains generic—"madness is just clarity without a filter" feels imported, and the moment when "awkward confidence blooming into something fiercer" tells rather than enacts transformation. Jax's motivational pivot (skepticism to compliance) happens off-page between beats, undercutting the relationship-as-crucible potential. The final choice lacks visible trade-off or cost tied to Lira's agency; the stones flare and voices roar, but what did she forfeit or risk?

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Nana Marisol's interiority reads competently with clear motivation (evolve tradition, distrust of the regime), but her peak choice—placing the amber sphere in the springs—arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost. The accidental telepathy trait functions as a convenient decoder rather than a double-edged attribute that complicates her agency. Embodied emotion is thin at the climax; she "smiled, her heart light" after a world-altering act, which reads as summary rather than contradictory feeling under pressure. The final beat needed a forfeited path or a felt ambivalence to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's interiority shows embodied trauma (flinching at gate sounds, trembling hands) and micro-choices (pressing palm to stone, smoothing photograph). However, the trajectory relies on therapy-speak labels: "somatic markers," "PTSD," "quietly talented hands" become diagnostic rather than felt. The final moment—"her heart steady"—arrives without visible internal contradiction acting in scene; the shift reads more as therapeutic summary than earned struggle. Mrs. Voss functions primarily as exposition conduit rather than applying immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows some interior specificity—smudged glasses, cataloging books—but his motivations remain abstract. The story tells us he's "crestfallen" and that "his art had stopped mattering," yet we never see a concrete choice driven by contradictory impulses under pressure. The final smile and platitude ("we're all just waiting to be rewoven") feel unearned; no on-page cost forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feelings are labeled or philosophically summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation (finding her vanished brother) is clear and drives her forward, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("serene anger," "consciously wild intuition") rather than embodied contradiction. The interaction with the child shows some earned insight, yet the progression from anger to understanding feels more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her brother's disappearance provides stakes, but we see little internal conflict or competing impulses that would deepen her agency at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to awaken Kael is established, but her internal conflict is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The phrase "bravely conflicted heart" is a label that replaces embodied tension. Her decision point arrives with minimal on-page struggle—she trembles, but the weight of crossing this threshold isn't dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. Kael's awakening and their exchange feel rushed, with his immediate understanding skipping the confusion or anger that would test Lirael's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "weave continuity through chaos" is declared but never tested on the page—she tends roses without meaningful friction or cost. Her father's transformation from bounty hunter to farmer is told retrospectively, not dramatized. The final "pressing her palm to the dome" reads as performed closure rather than a choice that forecloses options. Interiority leans on label-speak ("senselessly perceptive," "quiet courage") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but not tested under contradictory impulses; he remains composed throughout without genuine internal friction. The goddess encounter feels observational rather than a crucible that forces micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic description ("sorrow so profound") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to leave the spike in place carries minimal felt consequence, reading more as ritual than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's interiority is clear and embodied through action (tracing constellations, gripping the nib until it bites her palm). Her decision to expose her father is motivated by established values ("devotedly observant," truth-seeking), though the speed of her overnight investigation and immediate willingness to destroy her family legacy feel compressed. The internal conflict between loyalty and truth is present but could use more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene rather than a relatively smooth progression from shock to resolve. Minor deduction for the journalist relationship lacking pressure dynamics and Clara's mother's reaction ("How could you?") reading as stock rather than specific to their established dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation (confronting maternal guilt through firmware repair) is signaled but her interior remains generic—"hands trembled," "breath hitched"—without contradiction or embodied specificity under pressure. The decision to enter the firmware reads as plot obedience rather than a choice shaped by competing impulses; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Dr. Althea Voss's reveal as Lira's mother arrives late and unearned, a convenience that replaces psychological causality. Elara exists solely to exposit stakes without applying immediate interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes clearly ("discover meaning in it"), and her socially perceptive trait manifests in reading the grotto's "undercurrents." However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction—"lilac unease," "emergent hush," "whispering gallery"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to draw feels asserted more than earned by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Phrases like "quiet determination" replace visceral stakes with label-only emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("aberrant mercy," cradle empathy in arms of steel) is stated repeatedly but never tested by a choice that forces him to trade one value for another. The retrocognitive trait remains label-only; it produces atmospheric flashbacks but never constrains a present decision or imposes visible cost. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("warm coldness," "gentle radical") and therapy-speak ("aberrant mercy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act—placing the tessera—reads as symbolic gesture without foreclosing an alternative path or dramatizing internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is given clear synesthetic perception and encore-seeking motivation, but these operate as aesthetic labels rather than creating genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses in scene. The flapper woman and other spirits materialize without individual agency or resistance—they're summoned props rather than pressuring presences. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the "dance" that mends fractures happens because Elias hums louder, not because of any sacrifice or renunciation that tests his desire for applause against another need. The ending erases the coin and fades Elias with no dramatized price—he gets his encore without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to reject pills in favor of "natural" pathways is signaled early and drives his actions, but the stakes remain abstract—his geode work is described more than tested. His contradiction (sworn off enhancements, yet devising an alternative system) could deepen with visible cost, but the piece summarizes his progress ("worked through somatic markers") rather than dramatizing failure or trade-off. Mara's presence applies mild questioning but no genuine friction that forces Elias to renounce or alter course. The ending declares success ("undeniably real") without foreclosing a meaningful path or demonstrating what he sacrificed to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("her chest tight with resolve," "pulse quickened") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist's transformation from "cartographer of the physical world" to "translator" is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she observes the fossil, experiences a vision, and emerges changed without meaningful internal conflict or foreclosed path. The floating leaf and spore absorption read as passive reception rather than choice-driven agency. Minor positive: the heat-mapper usage shows some tactical engagement, but the closure moment lacks visible cost or a decision that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is declared but not contradicted or tested under pressure—she sorts buttons and receives a prophecy without any choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing: "quietly inspired, her mind a library of half-remembered tales," "her heart light." The final turn to cataloging more buttons feels arbitrary rather than earned by prior causality, and no visible cost attends her "raw possibility." Embodied emotion is minimal; the hourglass functions as prop rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation crystallizes through her father's memory, and the pillbox anchors her emotional arc. However, interiority relies heavily on stock spy-thriller phrases ("burned spy," "networks she'd once infiltrated") and therapy-speak abstractions ("the hollow where her courage used to live"). The final micro-choice—touching the pillbox and quickening her pace—registers but lacks visible cost or internal contradiction that would lift characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thaddeus exists as a passive observer with no meaningful choices or internal conflict. His motivation "to distill complexity into essence" is asserted through label-speak ("his gift—his motivation") without embodied cost or trade-offs. The ferryman remains a cipher without pressure or relationship dynamics. No character makes a decision that forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to understand fractured timelines is established and her zen-potter profile is maintained through "mind like still water" and steady hands. However, the revelation that she planted the sunflowers decades ago arrives late and feels more like a narrative convenience than an earned recognition. The internal arc—from seeking understanding to recognizing her own past action—lacks sufficient contradictory impulses in scene; she moves through discovery smoothly without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The final choice to leave and set up her wheel elsewhere feels like continuation rather than transformation earned by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is clear and his fire escape gardener identity is concrete, but his interior life lacks contradiction—he moves through the story with steady resolve rather than competing impulses. The gesture of giving Mara the bitting gauge feels willed by theme rather than earned through prior friction between his desire to help and the cost of persistence. Mara's acceptance and softening arrive too quickly; her resistance dissolves without dramatized struggle. The final choice lacks visible foreclosure—what path does opening the window close for her?

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to translate isolation into independence is clear and stated early, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("consciousness had splintered from the collective soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to write her own story feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure; we see her observing and receiving rather than struggling with competing impulses. The line "I see you, but I am not you" offers a stance, but the cost of this renunciation remains largely conceptual—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift follows on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's core desire (connection) is established early, but her interiority leans heavily on therapeutic self-diagnosis ("my own heart felt hollow," "I'm afraid I'll never feel truly connected"). The shift from helping others hide truths to encouraging them to speak aloud is told rather than tested; no on-page micro-choice forces her to forfeit a client relationship or risk her livelihood. Internal contradiction is minimal—she observes her own patterns without genuine competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and her actions track consistently, but her competence lacks genuine struggle—she anticipates the tricksters' moves, uploads code, and achieves results without meaningful friction or cost that tests her limits. The "cautiously hopeful" attribute is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her trajectory reads as steady confidence rather than warring doubt and hope. Professor Hale functions as a sounding board rather than applying meaningful pressure. The final choice to continue feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible internal shift or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's claustrophobia is asserted multiple times but never meaningfully constrains a choice—it "flares" then is "forgotten in the thrill." The compass-point stabbing feels unmotivated; we're told he's "prudently adventurous" but his actions read as generic fantasy-hero moves without internal contradiction or embodied cost. The final walk through the gateway carries no visible price or foreclosed path; the "wistful rebellion" label appears only in the closing line without prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's face-blindness trait generates her professional method (texture/shadow reading) and her embodied perception is consistent. However, her epiphany about Lila arrives through assertion rather than earned struggle: "For the first time, she *saw* her—not as a victim, but as a person" reads as a declarative leap rather than a choice under pressure. The final "awakened something" exchange tells rather than shows transformation, and the ribbon's meaning ("a plea for *connection*") is interpreted without internal friction or visible cost to Clara's prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation is clear—honoring her great-grandmother—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven. The "nervously confident smile" is mentioned but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her decision to read the stanza aloud at the climax feels unmotivated by prior characterization; we see no internal struggle between fear and duty, only a declarative action. The embodied cost of her choice remains invisible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("dynamically observant") and abstract claims rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "sculpt possibility" reads as thematic assertion without prior causal groundwork showing what he risks or loses. Marisol's shift from "rusted hinges" to "polished stone" voice is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior is labeled rather than embodied—"polished calm" and "perceptively calm" appear as assertions without contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "discover why some paths circle back" remains abstract; the crucial choice to leave territorial markers emerges from reflection rather than pressure-driven stakes. The father's drunken burning of money is vivid backstory, but Elias's present micro-choices (placing bills, watching from a distance) lack visible cost or internal friction. The final peace feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation (brother's disappearance) is clear and her professional role as dream chronicler is established, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract declarations ("fearing it would drown her") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to enter the hologram feels predetermined by plot rather than earned through dramatic struggle; no genuine renunciation or foreclosed path appears on the page. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany without prior micro-choices that would make surrender costly. Brother's coordinates becoming a "warning" in the glyphs lacks causal grounding in her prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her guarded nature is established, but her inner contradiction never truly acts *in scene*—the self-defense memory arrives as revelation rather than complicating a present choice. The vision sequence tells us she "had to face this" and "unbend," but the actual moment of acceptance reads as passive reception of spores rather than a willed micro-choice under live pressure. Embodied emotion is present in "chest tightened" and "heart lighter," yet the final shift from guilt to strength feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. The druid's competence (ritual magic, seed release, expanding-circle method) is never tested by genuine friction or failure that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is stated ("to find the intersection of dreams") but her micro-choices feel abstract—she follows tingles and visions rather than making decisions under visible internal conflict. The golden-eyed double delivers diagnostic wisdom ("fear is a mirror") that resolves her hesitation off-page; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Embodiment is present (scars ache, breath hitches) but the final acceptance lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses a live option—her scars vanish painlessly and she walks out "ready," suggesting gain without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's recklessness is asserted ("reckless idealist") but her actual choices feel passive—she follows the keeper's instructions without meaningful internal resistance or contradiction. The regret over the drowned boy is told rather than dramatically embodied in a present micro-choice that costs her something. The final transformation from recklessness to "fiercely gentle wisdom" arrives as summary epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lenny's roadie-to-appraiser trajectory is established early, and the cloth triggers concrete memory work. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic phrasing ("the hollow space where purpose used to live," "masking his terror") and the final epiphany—"resurrecting forgotten stories"—arrives as articulated insight rather than embodied cost. The phone-call resolution feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; Lenny's shift from appraisal to storytelling appears declared rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to understand transition is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("analogical thinking," "physics of transition") rather than embodied contradiction. The key action—placing the seed and chanting—lacks visible internal cost or competing impulses; she proceeds methodically without dramatized friction between fear and ambition. The shift from isolation to connection reads more as conceptual than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian automaton's fluctuating identity is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's transformation is told rather than embodied—"I'm… lighter" replaces concrete sensory experience. The child visitor at the end appears as a convenience echo rather than a character with distinct motives. Interior life remains abstract ("fear is a tide") without embodied contradiction or stakes-driven choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a passive vessel throughout—he follows glows, kneels, places objects, but never makes a decision under competing pressures. The "confessions" arrive as generic emotional labels (regret, longing) rather than embodied contradiction. The farmer, scientist, and child are shadow-figures whose problems solve themselves the moment Elias acts, with no visible cost or renunciation on his part. His transformation from inspector to "acolyte" is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interior life is established—off meds, seeking pattern in graffiti, chronicling rivers—but her choices remain observational throughout. The bellows accordion is handled physically, yet no contradictory impulses act in scene; she moves from one graffiti message to the next without meaningful resistance. The final "smile" and decision to walk away feel unmotivated by prior struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path. Therapy-speak ("self-forgiveness," "surrender") pervades peak beats without embodied friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation to find the library of unspoken words is declared but never tested by competing pressures or choices with visible cost. Interior life consists largely of observations and determination-assertions ("her resolve," "cautious exuberance") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "smile beneath her shawl" and mixed fear-excitement read as label-only emotion without embodied specificity. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply arrives at her goal without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority is concrete and image-rich (coffee stains as Rorschach, mulberry ache), but her final choice—dismantling the dream piece by piece—feels unmotivated by prior causality; the plants whisper warnings yet she proceeds, then reverses without visible friction. Emotional progression relies on poetic assertion ("a sound brittle as ice") rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation carries conceptual cost but lacks the on-page micro-choices that would earn Stasis; we see the outcome, not the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's professional competence is established through embodied action (adjusting spectacles, painting symbols, humming), and her stakes are clear. However, interiority remains thin—her fear of failure is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The triumph at the end feels unearned by prior struggle; the pool cracks and she fixes them with a vial and song without meaningful cost or foreclosed options. No genuine blind spots or compounding mistakes shape the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation to find contentment is established, but her interior contradictions feel muted—she's already achieved forgiveness three years prior, so current pressure reads more reflective than urgent. The sister's return with the hairpin lands as convenient resolution rather than earned through Lirael's on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present (chest tightening, trembling knees) but the interiority leans toward self-aware philosophical summary ("a seed planted in soil of regret") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias functions coherently as a "conscience for hire" with a distinct professional stance—offering doubt rather than certainty. His interior voice is specific ("Doubt doesn't keep a schedule"), and the cloak scene embodies his experience of softening convictions. However, the final choice feels rushed; Mira's arc (removing chimes) lacks sufficient internal contradiction or cost on the page to earn the shift from paralysis to clarity. The backstory fragments (prior client, mirror origin) anchor present choices but occupy ~15% without yielding a decisive micro-choice that alters Elias's stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to teach vanishing is stated but never tested through on-page choices that foreclose options. The backward-aging premise remains decorative; her decisions don't emerge from aging-related contradictions or embodied costs. Lira's "desperate" need is told, not shown through micro-choices under competing pressures. Elara's withholding reads as authorial manipulation rather than character-driven constraint with visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interior life reads largely as abstraction: "resolve weathered but unbroken," "his mind attuned to the echoes." The final-morning turn lacks embodied stakes—he walks with measured steps but no on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent; the piece narrates adjustment without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is stated clearly but his choices feel largely frictionless—he succeeds at mist walking on the second try, pours starlight without hesitation, and the spire rewards him with a ready-made sanctuary. Internal conflict is minimal; the "underachieving mage" label does not generate on-page struggle or contradictory impulses during peak beats. The final garden transformation reads as wish fulfillment rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in tears freezing, but the arc from failure to mastery bypasses meaningful renunciation or error that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's dominant motive (discovering the color of sound tied to Lila's death) is established early and drives the descent into the ship. Interior reflection is extensive but anchored to present stimuli (the key tag, the books). The climactic moment—placing the key tag on the desk and whispering "I see you now"—lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost; the renunciation reads as therapeutic epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Emotional progression tilts toward label-only insight ("the vow he'd kept locked away had always been luminous") without sufficient on-page struggle at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's role as "cast lots decision maker" remains largely abstract—he observes, arranges coins, and adjusts dials, but these actions don't reflect competing impulses or genuine struggle. His shift from "stellar doubt" to clarity arrives unearned; the text tells us "the doubt that had clung to him like stardust began to shed" without showing a painful choice or embodied tension. Interiority leans on cosmic abstractions ("a sparkler of curiosity," "a cold draft from the future") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The final moment of alignment feels declarative rather than rooted in contradictory desires fought through on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to name nameless fears is established and carried through, but his interior life remains largely declarative. The backstory about Lira exceeds 20% by rough count and flattens present pressure in the middle third—*"He'd failed to answer then. Now, he whispered, '*Fear. And names.*'"* reads more like thematic caption than embodied choice. The prism action and whispered response constitute micro-choices, but the final turn lacks visceral cost; we see monsters dissolve, not Elias foreclosing a live path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias displays consistent traits—earnestly naive optimism, brittle devotion—through concrete actions (rigging scaffold, adjusting bell tilt). His motivation to fix the cosmic imbalance drives micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but mild: he clings to hope despite repeated failure, though the stakes of his gamble never force a visible trade-off between competing impulses. Marla remains functional but serves primarily as sounding board without applying meaningful relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's vigilance is established and her choices trace logically through the story. The final decision to "start here" and share photographs shows internal shift, but the motivation for this change feels slightly under-earned—the encounter with Elias's daughter prompts it, but Mara's interior contradiction between hoarding and sharing needed more embodied resistance in the moment. The liqueur-as-poison revelation and Elias's choice are told rather than discovered through Mara's active investigation, reducing her agency at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is articulated through poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—her stated conflict between "logic and intuition" never manifests as simultaneous impulses forcing a live choice with cost. The crystal-touching sequence relies on declarative epiphany ("The touch of wonder...was not a force to be seized—it was a permission") rather than dramatized friction between competing drives. The hand-in-flame beat gestures toward visceral stakes but immediately resolves into clarity without ongoing struggle or trade-off. Backstory about her father and mother remains inert context rather than tilting a present micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation (preserve the arbor, honor his mother) is clear and embodied through his physical interaction with the buckle and trees. Internal contradiction is minimal—he moves from uncertainty to competent action without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The mother's vanishing and the "Trust" transmission supply backstory that primes the present choice, but Kael's arc feels more like competent problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Muscle memory guides him smoothly; no blind spots complicate his work.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation ("defeat the emotional numbness") is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The clone confrontation unfolds as external spectacle—energy surges, platform groaning—while interiority remains abstract ("emotions flaring to life like a dormant volcano"). The final choice to merge energies lacks prior causal grounding in character contradiction; we're told he's "whole and unbroken" without witnessing the cost of that integration on the page. Therapy-speak ("ego death," "emotional numbness") substitutes for embodied stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlowe's motivation to restore laughter is established early, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mournfully eager," "sunken but alive with a flicker of hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The physical toll (blisters, aching legs, burned throat) provides concrete cost, yet the emotional arc moves in a straight line from determination to tears without meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final collapse reads as cathartic release rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and no blind spot or flaw complicates his success.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's dimensionally homesick state and guardian oath establish clear motivation, and her decision to throw the pendant creates a meaningful turn. However, her pivot from "I'll return it to the vaults" to discarding it in the fountain lacks on-page deliberation or embodied hesitation—the choice arrives suddenly after the cultist's plea, reading more as plot service than earned contradiction. The cultist collapses and gasps warnings, but his interiority and stakes remain opaque, reducing him to a device. Interior voice carries specificity ("waiting was her art"), but the climactic choice needed one more micro-beat of conflicted impulse to feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to "interrupt destiny" is established and his stoic-sensitive trait manifests in absorbed failures, but the pivotal choice to pour his essence feels rushed—the cost is declared ("hands scarred, mind frayed") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in the moment. The mentor's voice provides some internal conflict, yet Kael's decision path reads more linear than wrestled. Embodied emotion is present (trembling fingers, bleeding hands) but the climactic sacrifice lacks the layered ambivalence that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("hush," "beginning in every ending") rather than embodied contradiction. His decade-spanning expertise is asserted but never encounters genuine struggle or blind spots; the tower's systems "resist" for one beat before he solves them by discarding components. The final laugh and awestruck response feel performed rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values. No secondary character applies immediate pressure to test his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's "resiliently positive nature" is label-only until it "falters," then disappears; his final smile feels unmotivated by prior contradiction. The hourglass choice at the climax ("Okay... But you have to trust me") lacks visible internal conflict—he simply decides. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his resiliently positive heart swelling") and the emotional arc telescopes from wavering to tears to swelling heart without embodied progression.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    Clara's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" remains abstract throughout; no micro-choices reveal competing impulses under pressure. The curator is a hologram-like dispenser of wisdom rather than a pressure source. Interiority leans heavily on stock metaphor ("fever dream architect," "heart light") without embodied contradiction. The ending epiphany—"courage to weave her own path"—arrives unearned by prior struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's interior life is largely told through abstract declarations ("felt adrift," "sense of purpose") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The chain-link moment gestures toward embodiment but remains static description. Her final "learning to navigate by starlight herself" reads as summary epiphany without on-page micro-choices that reveal cost or foreclose a path. Student Tarel appears only to ask a setup question, applying no real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lila's professional competence is asserted rather than tested; her "persistently curious mind" and tools arrive conveniently without meaningful friction. The final choice to deliver the message feels externally motivated by job duty rather than earned through internal contradiction. The woman from the photograph materializes at the fountain without dramatized summoning or causal bridge, weakening agency. Embodiment is present in moments ("throat tightened") but interiority often defaults to smooth professional narration without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's claustrophobia is established early and embodied through physical sensation ("breath came in shallow gasps," "walls seemed to press in"), but her agency is primarily reactive throughout. The motivation linking her brother's disappearance to the gold fleck feels told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she moves forward because the story requires it, not because we see her wrestle with competing fears. The final tears and trembling land as generic emotional markers rather than character-specific embodiment. Interior voice occasionally slips into expository mode ("It wasn't just gold—it was a catalyst") that explains rather than enacts discovery under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivations are present but remain largely abstract—he counts heartbeats and carries a porcelain shard as compulsions tied to an error, yet the interior tension between living/dead feels performed rather than embodied with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The woman's presence is told through objects and exposition rather than dramatized friction that forces Elias into a choice with visible cost. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("rebellion against the machine's lie," "digital ghost") without the messy irrationality or hierarchy of values a true crisis would surface. The final smile and declaration feel like a pivot without the earned causality of prior struggle narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The storyteller's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. Her fear of oblivion is stated late ("I fear extinction"), and her laugh-then-throw decision lacks prior micro-choices showing internal conflict. The copper veins and diamond-handling provide some sensory grounding, but interiority often labels ("simple," "knew better," "understood") rather than enacting. The final renunciation arrives without visible cost foreclosing a path—she climbs down with "steady hands," undercutting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority carries some embodied detail (arrowhead warming, throat tightening), but her motivations feel scattered—researcher, sister, fear of irrelevance—without coherent hierarchy under pressure. The transformation choice arrives via herbalist instruction rather than internal contradiction, undermining agency. Her final "smile, frostbitten hope curdling into resolve" uses label-speak at the peak moment and the decisive turn (choosing to return changed) lacks visible cost on the page; we're told she'll return "not as a researcher" but the forfeiture remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and consistent, but her interior remains abstract through most beats—"resonantly soft," "trembled like moth wings"—label-heavy phrasing rather than embodied contradiction. The moment she notices the statue's crack and presses the shell shows micro-choice under pressure, but the final act (blowing into the shell, watching statues crumble) reads more as wish-fulfillment than earned agency with visible cost that forecloses a path. The violin-string snap gestures toward sacrifice but doesn't alter her next move or constrain the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's mailman identity and "respectfully rebellious" stance are present but motivation remains murky ("even to him"). The action of releasing the storm is dramatized, but the interior choice to do so lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost at the decision point—he simply mutters and hands it over. The final walk home offers reflection on his role but no meaningful internal change or foreclosed path with felt price. Backstory touches ("he'd learned long ago," "always been") add texture but do not tilt a present micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elio's motivation ("interpret silence as possibility") is declared rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. His actions—searching, finding, singing—follow a smooth arc without genuine internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The courtyard transformation reads as external validation rather than earned alteration driven by his flaws or struggle. Embodied emotion is minimal; interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") instead of character-particular sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's internal life is present but relies on safe abstractions ("archivist of the unseen," "Mobius strip" metaphors) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The midnight ritual shows some embodied searching, but the pivot to "finding the place where stories live" lacks the friction of a genuine internal conflict—she moves smoothly from restlessness to epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The choice to "continue" at the end feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear (chasing a lost dream), but interior contradiction is minimal—she pursues the dream linearly without dramatized self-doubt or competing impulses. The climactic moment where the dream speaks feels unmotivated by prior interiority; it arrives as authorial gift rather than earned reversal. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is told through abstractions ("hope as luminous as the absence") rather than physical sensation under pressure. The final acceptance lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration ("unassumingly bold," "quiet intensity") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The woman's backstory is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that test his values under present pressure. The final realization—"the idea he had freed was not just hers, but his own"—arrives as assertion without prior on-page struggle between contradictory impulses. Motivation is stated early but never forces a visible trade-off with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is internally consistent but his interiority relies heavily on summarized curiosity rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The dream visitation and Clara's voice at the end feel like convenient narrative devices rather than choices that foreclose paths. The final moment where he "sat by the fairy ring...and waited" reads as stasis without visible cost—no renunciation of safety, time, or relationship is dramatized. Embodied emotion is thin; most feelings are labeled ("thrill," "restless") rather than shown through physical specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's walking-backwards habit is label-heavy and appears primarily as quirk rather than a constraint that forecloses options under pressure. The visitor is functionally a receiver of wisdom rather than an active pressure source, and the exchange lacks meaningful internal contradiction or embodied friction. Lirael's motives read as stable and declarative ("exile is reversible") without competing impulses or visible cost. The closure moment—"Then the shadow caught in glass will shift"—relies on metaphorical assertion rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly articulated (preserve wonder's color), but her internal experience remains abstract. The peak choice—hurling the seed—lacks embodied contradiction or visible hesitation; she succeeds without genuine struggle or foreclosed alternatives. The iridescent blossom arrival feels like a reward rather than a cost that alters her stance. Agency at closure reads more as fulfillment than renunciation or endurance with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interior is present but generic: "she'd learned that some hushes were meant to be broken" reads as therapy-speak rather than character-particular insight. Her final state—"lucid," "awake," "alive"—is told via abstract labels without embodied cost. The needle-work shows micro-choices under pressure, but the fisherman's secret is explained by Elias rather than discovered through Mara's struggle, undercutting agency. Emotional progression from fear to readiness occurs off-page between paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's methodical curiosity drives reconnaissance moves (collecting film, comparing frames), but his interior life remains abstract—"chest tightened," "breath fogged"—without embodied contradiction or visible trade-offs. The grandfather's journal and years of archive work are told, not dramatized, so the urgency feels inherited rather than earned. The final "smile" and reframed understanding land as epiphany-by-arrival, lacking the on-page struggle or foreclosed path that would constitute felt cost. Competence is high, but genuine flaw or ambiguity that complicates the closure choice is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—mapping grief through physics—but her interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("phase transition," "half-life of memory") rather than embodied contradiction. The snow globe functions well as an anchor object that reveals character through handling, and her choice to pack it at the end signals a shift in stance. However, the final turn feels more intellectually declared than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("the quiet, analytic ache") that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior life consists largely of poetic yearning without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivations—articulating unspoken needs through encoded messages—remain abstract; the story tells us he encodes for Lira and his brother but never shows him wrestling with competing desires or costs in real time. The gestures (kneeling, drawing, whispering) are present but lack embodied tension or self-contradiction. Emotional states are asserted ("smiled," "wondered") rather than dramatized through perception and micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's warmly inquisitive nature is shown through her tracing symbols and yearning to solve the puzzle, but her final choice to hand over the diary and goggles feels unearned—no visible internal conflict or foreclosed path. The widow is sketched through grief and trembling hands, yet remains a porcelain mask without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Mara's embodied reactions (chest tightening, breath fogging glass) anchor emotion, but the shift from tidying servant to truth-seeker lacks a dramatized cost that would elevate the change.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's interior world is textured with specific embodied moments—gripping the telescope, knuckles white—and her motivation is grounded in personal loss (her mother's death). However, key beats lean toward summary and label ("quietly explosive" alchemy, "spooled wholeness") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in action. The final choice to "keep memorializing" feels more like continued research than a path foreclosed with visible cost; Voss remains a sounding board without exerting genuine counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's prosopagnosia shapes her perception ("memorizing souls through textures and hues") but never constrains a choice under pressure. Her curiosity drives investigation, yet the discovery sequence feels frictionless—no hesitation costs, no clash between professional duty and trespassing. The final walk-away with the safe lacks visible consequence or internal conflict about theft versus preservation. Interiority remains observational rather than conflicted until the ending, where agency compresses into grabbing and leaving without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's curiosity is clearly motivated and drives her through the cargo hold puzzle, but her leap into the void lacks earned internal conflict—she ignores the captain and jumps without wrestling contradictory impulses on the page. The "I'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth" summary in the final beat tells rather than dramatizes her transformation. Jax and the captain remain functional but one-note, applying external pressure without revealing their own stakes. The diligently curious trait is label-claimed but not visibly traded against another value with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael's motivation is told through reflective nostalgia rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The character moves through spaces observing and remembering, but his internal conflict remains abstract—there's no dramatized struggle between competing wants or fears when he opens the chest. The final moment ("knew he'd found not just tools, but a connection to the past") reads as label-only epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodiment is thin: "heart racing" at the mirror is the strongest physical marker, but emotional texture defaults to generic determination and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's altruism is asserted through labels ("altruistic," "pure," "never lied") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her consistency is declared as "strangely trustworthy" but no on-page moment forces her to choose between competing goods or pay a visible cost. The settlers are present only as an abstract collective; no individual friction tests her motives. The final materialization and speech feel more like exposition than earned character action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's occupation and grandfather backstory provide concrete motivation, and the final singing choice carries visible cost (the pane cracks, the puppet shatters). However, interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("accept her own flaws—the doubt that gnawed at her, the fear that she'd miscalculated") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The decisive act of singing is dramatized, but the internal struggle is summarized rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Backstory occupies substantial space (~25%) but does anchor present choices, keeping the piece within BRR tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's motivation (caretaker bound by curse, obligated to save travelers) is clear and drives his choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and embodied through physical detail ("ridges biting into his palm," frozen breath). Internal conflict surfaces in his hatred of the birds balanced against obligation, though the contradiction could press harder in the climax. The shift from reluctance to action is credible but the final moment lacks a visible personal cost that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows some embodied grief and professional lens (foam patterns, polymers as melodies), but emotional progression relies heavily on metaphor-heavy reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The reconciliation with Mara feels rushed—months of silence dissolve after one text with minimal on-page resistance or cost. Mara remains thinly sketched, functioning primarily as the relationship terminal rather than applying independent pressure. The chrysalis functions more as symbolic convenience than a choice-driver; Elara's decision to return to the studio lacks visible struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") is clear but remains abstract throughout; her interiority relies heavily on conceptual vocabulary ("void," "absence," "glimmering parole") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The hooded man's single eye and frosted knife are vivid but his choice to take the jar lacks dramatized internal conflict—he simply agrees and leaves. The final smile and understanding ("stories didn't begin in grand gestures...") reads as unearned epiphany, not a realization forged through on-page struggle or cost. No micro-choices under pressure reveal competing values; the stance crystallization at the end feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nessar's motivation—to "sandpaper rough memories"—is clear and sustained, and his choice to subsume the founder's guilt demonstrates on-page agency with embodied cost ("the weight of the fortress on his shoulders"). However, interiority leans toward abstract labels ("the sting of tears, the weight of a decision") and the final cooking sequence softens tension through metaphor rather than dramatized contradiction. The guard's retreat and the pavilion's "emotionally contagious nature" remain told rather than tested through conflicted micro-choices. Decent baseline, no slips at closure, but missing the embodied ambiguity and layered cost needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is assigned traits ("empathetically decisive," "harmonious choral librarian") but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven. The work she performs—singing in multiple languages, soldering the weight—never reveals internal contradiction or embodied struggle; she moves through the repair as if following a script. The villagers' transformation at the end occurs without resistance or prior friction, making the change feel convenient rather than earned. Diagnostic label-speak ("empathetically decisive") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("shared language, shared pain, shared hope") flatten what should be a crisis of agency into a demonstration of pre-assigned competence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's "helix-minded engineer" trait and "chaotically precise" attribute remain largely decorative labels rather than embodied constraints that shape choices under pressure. His motivation to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is told via exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the mirror-repair scene. The interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("fractured psyche," "synaptic plasticity") without grounding emotional states in specific bodily sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The ending choice—successfully repairing the mirror—feels predetermined by the premise rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior is present but relies heavily on abstract labels ("prism-minded," "kaleidoscope of overlapping timelines") rather than embodied contradiction. Her choice to enter the grotto and follow the map reads as goal-pursuit, but no competing impulse complicates the path—she moves through each beat without visible internal friction. The final shift to "keeper of thresholds" is declared rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a prior stance. Embodied emotion is minimal; most interiority remains conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to create music in silence is clear and sustained, but her interior life remains abstract through much of the piece. The "symphonically minded mind" and "empathy in motion" read as conceptual labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final weeping moment lands, but the weeks-long arc of bleeding nails and aching shoulders is summarized rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. No meaningful internal conflict emerges—she pursues her goal steadily without contradiction or cost that forecloses another path until the porcelain shatters, which feels more like plot mechanics than character-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alaric's interior world is concrete and grounded in chess metaphors that shape his perception. The memory of Lira and the queen's diagonal movement provides a clear character-specific lens, and the final act of planting the seed shows earned change. However, the star-mage interaction feels externalized—Alaric receives validation rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses at the peak moment. The exile backstory and chess-teaching heresy are told cleanly but remain abstract stakes that don'tpress him with a visible tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent—cataloging silence as language—but her interior texture lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The character is competent and purposeful, yet never genuinely struggles; the lock yields to patience without dramatized cost that forecloses a path. The grandmother exists only as textual artifact; no relationship pressure tests Lirael's stance on the page. Embodied emotion is present but muted; phrases like "strange kinship" tell rather than show contradictory feeling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and she demonstrates patience through concrete actions (adjusting soil, sitting with the seed). However, her internal arc is thin—the shift from rushing to stillness is asserted through a dream rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandmother's wisdom arrives as convenient guidance rather than emerging from Lira's own struggle. Embodied emotion is present in her breathless journaling, but the peak choice (simply waiting) lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority is largely observational rather than contradictory; she moves through the discovery without internal conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The arrow-tip warming and her theorizing read as exposition rather than embodied pressure. The final "smile" and role-acceptance feel unearned—no visible cost forecloses a path, and the shift from seeking exploitation to guardianship lacks dramatized friction. Competence is unbalanced by struggle; she solves the mystery without mistake or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Anya's investigator role is established with concrete sensory detail and her motivation (mentor's death) provides clear drive. However, her discovery process feels passive—she climbs and finds rather than makes choices that narrow options. The engineer's sudden appearance and glazed transformation lacks causal grounding in Anya's prior observations, weakening the earned quality of the encounter. Interior contradictions are minimal; she moves methodically without visible cost until the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's synesthetic gift is specified but remains largely decorative—she "sees" sound as color, yet this trait doesn't constrain a single on-page choice or generate visible cost. Her internal life consists of poetic declarations ("Wonder isn't a luxury") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Veyra's sudden conversion from skeptic to believer happens via convenient off-stage magic rather than earned struggle. The ending celebrates transformation without foreclosing a path or showing what Lira sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is established early and interiority is present, but interior contradiction is thin—he moves from grief to insight without the pull of competing impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's cryptic "unmake your failures" lands as puzzle rather than visceral stakes. Embodied emotion appears ("throat tightened," "hands shook") but some beats lean toward label-only ("fear," "resolve"). The final choice to etch a rune for surrender reads as conceptual shift rather than earned renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's habit of "borrowing personalities" is asserted but never shown constraining a choice or generating friction on the page. His epiphany—"emotions weren't variables"—arrives through the fragment's magic rather than earned dramatic pressure, reading as convenient rather than costly. Veyra's interiority is accessed without clean focalization, creating head-hopping. The final tear-fogged goggles moment gestures toward change but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kail's jitteriness is embodied through physical gestures (adjusting strap, shivering) and his interiority shows contradiction between mentor-taught confidence and present fear. The final choice to plant the seed feels somewhat unmotivated—he questions the woman but then immediately complies without visible internal struggle or cost that would foreclose another path. Veyra remains abstract despite recurring mentions; her absence shapes theme more than it generates on-page pressure through Kail's micro-choices. The woman's sudden appearance and disappearance reads convenient rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—validation from her mentor—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract mystic framing ("commune with the earth," "read the silence") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivot from "prove objects absorb emotions" to "they mirror them" arrives as sudden insight without prior dramatized doubt or micro-choices showing her wrestling with evidence. The final laugh and peace feel unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path. Interiority leans on label-speak ("sickening lurch," "bitter and free") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to restore the village through weaving is clear and her choice to sacrifice the amber bead earns the ending's weight. However, her interior life relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("wistful hope," "the weight of unspoken words") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final decision to "let go" and weave silence itself feels gestured at rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The shift from wool to silence as material lacks concrete grounding in her physical experience of the loom.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jorin's core motivation (awakening Veyra's vitality) is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("quiet fire," "deliberate nature"). The cavern ordeal—enduring shard strikes—is told in declarative summary ("He didn't flinch") rather than embodied through contradictory impulse or visceral cost. The final smile and village reaction feel asserted rather than earned by on-page change; we see no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to find his mother drives choices across beats, and his final decision to hurl the shard away demonstrates agency with cost. However, interiority often relies on stock phrasing ("breath hitched," "chest tightened") and the visor device functions more as exposition tool than embodied constraint. The encounter with the mother-figure lacks genuine internal contradiction—Kael processes the revelation cleanly rather than wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. The ending shift reads earned but the path there smooths over psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is anchored in concrete observations—the sea glass hum beneath his thumb, the way morning light slants—and his reticence is shown through gruff syllables and silence. Internal change from dismissive skepticism to "warmly observant anticipation" is signaled but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the shift reads smooth rather than conflicted. The final smile and gesture feel earned by the chain's accumulation, though the renunciation of isolation could press harder against established traits. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slides toward label ("curiosity," "anticipation") without full sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Herald's motivation to "shape the future" is declared but never concretely tested—she adjusts the wick, sees shadows, and decides she's ready, but no on-page choice forecloses a path or costs her something visible. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her breath catching," "the sound echoing off the stones") and therapy-speak self-awareness ("total internal reflection required focus, a willingness to let the light consume her"). The final "choice" to raise the lantern feels performed rather than earned by prior contradiction or struggle. Embodied emotion is minimal; laughter recurs as a tic without contradictory impulse acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lin's interiority carries specific texture—the "two people" sensation after transplant reads as embodied contradiction. The desire to understand story-magnetism drives her tracking movements, though the shift from watchful observation to decision lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion appears in "hands steady" and "ravenously," but the climax moment (wing vanishing, insight arriving) feels more like epiphany than a choice under competing pressure. The final commitment to "illuminate stories" is declared rather than enacted with a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal landscape is heavily narrated rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His wound healing and the tower's properties are told as abstract concepts ("quantified sorrow," "healing property") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The protagonist moves through his work methodically but never faces a moment where his motives collide with cost in a way that forecloses a path. The final smile and acceptance feel declared rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira remains a vessel for action rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her interior life consists of memory fragments and the task at hand, but no competing desires or blind spots emerge under pressure. The moment she presses her palm to the mica and hums feels unmotivated by prior characterization—she simply performs the role assigned. The body is present (calloused hands, exhaustion) but emotions are labeled rather than embodied: "heart light," "breath caught."

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's motivation—to reconcile grief through her mother's society—is clear and rooted. However, her internal progression feels more summarized than embodied; the mirror-chamber epiphany ("she felt seen") arrives without prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final stance (hiding as "choosing when to reveal") is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("reconcile her grief," "truly seen") at pivotal beats flattens what should be contradictory, embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established through his perceptual lens and "creeping normality" noticing, but his interior remains largely label-driven ("the sacred in the ordinary," "heuristically gentle") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The courtyard work shows micro-choices, yet the woman's arrival and cryptic exchange feel more like a thematic stamp than genuine pressure testing his stance. The final shift—from fear to acceptance—lacks visible cost; he "softened" but no on-page choice forecloses a live path. The embodied detail (trembling hands, calloused palms) is present but doesn't offset the therapy-speak undertow at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her meticulous nature shapes her approach, but internal contradiction is thin—she experiences frustration and exhaustion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final success feels too clean; the cost of her years of struggle doesn't visibly foreclose options or alter her stance. Embodied emotion is present (humming the tuning fork, slamming her fist) but the arc from gently meticulous to frantic doesn't show a character trade-off with lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivations are clear—retrieve the device, protect her father's legacy—and her "curiously steadfast" trait drives her through missteps. Internal contradictions appear in the bell chamber when her hands shake but she acts decisively, and the closing smile suggests complicated acceptance. However, the father's voice on the recording feels unmotivated by prior scene work; we never see Lira process why he'd plead or what that changes about her mission, leaving the peak emotional beat under-earned. The embodied detail is strong (watch fob chain biting her palm, breath echoing), but the final stance shift reads too smooth given the betrayal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael's motivation to understand weather-carrying people is clear and his method (taste-sensing) provides concrete interiority. However, his choices feel passive—he kneels, waits, and reacts rather than pursuing active decisions under pressure. The "luminous skeptic" label remains decorative; his skepticism never forces a meaningful internal contradiction or trade-off. Lira's late arrival delivers exposition rather than creating relational friction, and the copper-taste moment doesn't lead to a character-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias's motivation—to uncork suppressed creativity—is clear and sustained, but his interior life leans toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation from "soul starved of color" to "truly seen" is asserted more than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's backstory arrives as exposition without concrete anchoring in present action. No second on-page character creates relationship pressure; the cave and objects do that work instead.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and personal (recovering mother's last words), and her calligrapher's quill provides a concrete constraint that affects tactics. Internal contradiction appears when she both seeks crystallized conversations and must confront their illusory nature, but the keeper's revelation feels externally imposed rather than arising from Elara's own discovery. The final choice to "plant the seed" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than a decision forged through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, breath hitching) but leans toward stock gestures at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her seasonally mute state is treated as a completed choice with no on-page cost or friction; the vow is backstory. The final bell-strike feels like a gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is absent—she watches her creation without struggle or micro-decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara-7's motivation to resolve inner static is present but largely told rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The static-as-burden-turned-song arc reads clean, though the embodied contradictions remain thin—optics flicker, joints creak, but these feel more like status indicators than lived struggle. The final smile and clear optics land too tidily after decades of glitch, undercutting the "fragmented wholeness" the piece claims. The box interaction and plasma torch choice do create one pressure point, but her agency in that moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's curiosity is consistent, but her motivation remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The week-long investigation compresses to summary ("Over the next week, she listened"), flattening what should be peak pressure into exposition. Micro-choices exist (brewing coffee, asking questions) but lack visible cost or internal friction. The final tearful moment reads as label-only emotion without embodied contradiction or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is present but relies heavily on metaphor and abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The key choice—dancing to decode—reads more as symbolic solution than genuine struggle between competing impulses. His emotional progression from methodical descent to defiant waltz lacks intermediate friction; he moves through crisis without visible cost to his hierarchy of values. The scientist's encrypted vulnerability is told rather than dramatized through Kael's own flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to reclaim deleted memories is clear and sustained, but his internal experience remains largely externalized through metaphysical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic moment—touching the rose and receiving someone else's memories—lacks the felt cost of renunciation; he simply "no longer feared" the pockets, a label-only resolution. The pressed wildflowers function more as talisman than lived anchor to his wife's erasure, and the final pivot to "guide others" arrives without dramatized friction between his personal quest and this new altruism.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The summoner remains abstract throughout—"terrestrially cosmic" eyes and "tranquil blaze" motivation are labels without embodied cost or contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; she executes a ritual without internal friction or genuine struggle. The ending claims success via passive dissolution ("crumbling to dust") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Diagnostic phrasing ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush") replaces particularized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias's motivation (learning building language) is present but remains abstract; his choices at closure (following her, speaking to the library) feel reactive rather than driven by visible internal contradiction. The woman's character is more vivid through selective gesture ("patience… nimbleness"), but both figures lack embodied emotion under pressure—the climactic moment when he "lets the words rise… from his bones" is asserted rather than dramatically earned through prior micro-choices that show cost. Internal states are told cleanly but never contradict each other in scene, flattening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's interior world is richly detailed—"tragically radiant" armor, archived pain in labeled jars—but her motivations shift abruptly without dramatized pressure. The pivot from hoarding isolation to seeking independence feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The eight-year-old memory is vivid and embodied, yet the subsequent leap to "repurposing" pain lacks visible cost or micro-choices that foreclose a path. Therapy-speak ("quarantined memory," "translate isolation") weakens peak beats where embodied action should anchor change.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her interior remains abstract—"tasting of iron and regret"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The backstory about the queen and her sister is summary-only; we never see Lirael's present stance shift through an on-page choice tied to this history. The final act of placing the scroll and walking away reads as resolved intention rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to learn why some echo is stated but never tested through contradictory impulses or visible cost. The discovery scene with the hooded figure delivers exposition rather than forcing a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "melancholy swelling") and the final decision to "keep singing" arrives without dramatized struggle or renunciation. No embodied emotional contradiction acts simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to "salvage something pure" is asserted early but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. His action is passive observation of others' dreams rather than micro-choices under pressure. The sailor's ghost, widow, son, and lighthouse keeper exist as static portraits delivered through summary rather than embodied scenes that force Kael to choose between competing goods. The final placement of the snow globe on the altar reads as ceremonial gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is consistent—his meditation on hidden patterns and effort—but his interiority leans heavily on philosophical reflection rather than embodied tension. The discovery of the fireflies' code produces a moment of wonder ("his heart quickened"), yet the emotion is summarized rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses. The protagonist's choices (following the whistle, tracing the rhythm with the whisk) are purposeful but lack internal friction or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The ending offers stasis rather than transformation, acceptable as Earned Stasis only if endurance forecloses an alternative, but here the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation as truth-excavator is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Her "intuition prickled" and mechanical puzzle-solving feel competent without cost—the decision to place the diamond reads as puzzle-completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt weight. The survival motivation ("not just truth—it was survival") arrives late and competes with the truth-excavator frame without friction. Internal experience remains functional but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation—communion with ancient frequencies—remains consistent, but his interior life is largely label-driven ("lonely visionary," "relic and catalyst") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The prophetic gift feels asserted more than dramatized; we're told he unravels riddles but never see him struggle against a misinterpretation or pay a visible cost for this ability. The final moment ("You are the prism. You are the storm.") reads as declarative epiphany without prior friction between want and fear, and no path is foreclosed with on-page consequence—he achieves alignment without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "translate between generations" is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses. His decision-making unfolds smoothly—capturing sounds, testing the box, sharing melodies—without internal friction or visible cost until the final choice. The tears at hearing his mother's lullaby provide an embodied moment, but the arc lacks a meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path. The self-aware poetic revisions mid-scene read as meta-commentary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to protect the key is clear, and his use of the resonator under pressure shows agency. However, the ghost's transformation from threat to ally happens too quickly without sufficient internal conflict dramatized in Elias; the shift reads more like plot convenience than earned change. The "logically emotional" attribute is stated repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it remains a label rather than a lived contradiction. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("chest tighten," "vision blurring") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority shows purpose-driven focus ("sculpt patience from impatience"), but internal contradiction is thin—he mutters mantras without embodied struggle between competing impulses. The shift from haste to patience is told via a single failed attempt and a self-correction rather than dramatized through layered, contradictory wants acting simultaneously. Embodiment is selective (breath puffs, aching back) yet emotional states lean toward label-only serenity. The acolyte exchange at the end gestures toward earned wisdom but lacks visible cost that forecloses a live path for Kael himself.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to expose Cole is clear, but her internal process relies heavily on label-driven interiority ("watchfully calm" repeated without embodied contradiction). The lantern visions provide moments of embodied pressure, but the final stance—"done being controlled"—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. Secondary characters (Cole, Eliza) exist only in summary or vision, never applying immediate pressure in scene. The climactic decision to "expose his secrets" is declared rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    Father Marcus's motivation is established (evaluate the program, seek certainty) but his interior landscape remains thin. The "aptly deliberate" trait is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The clockwork heart moment provides concrete engagement, but his final decision to "turn the warden's apology into action" arrives without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost—he simply knows what he must do. Embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal competing values are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's obsession with the yearning algorithm and the bell is established early, but her interior life leans heavily on label-only descriptors ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The climactic dive and arrow-throw feel more conceptual than character-earned; we don't see her wrestle with genuine doubt or cost that would foreclose an alternate path. Minor positive: her "gears with feet" dismissal and whooping ascent carry distinct voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("pulse quickening," "heart raced"). The final decision to upload coordinates and flee reads more as plot necessity than earned character choice—we see determination asserted but not the internal contradiction or cost that would make her renunciation of safety credible. Hale is a one-note obstacle whose lies are telegraphed rather than dramatized through behavior. Elara exists only as archived voice, which suits the premise, but Lira's emotional connection to her case lacks embodied specificity beyond repeated gazing at the patch.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is heavily filtered through abstract meditation ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced peacekeeper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mirror-walking sequence offers glimpses—sailor's terror, mother's clutch—but these remain viewed artifacts rather than internal conflicts acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "give the storm a heart" reads as a conceptual win without foreclosing a live path or showing what Elara sacrificed to achieve it. Motivation remains thematic (mapping empathy onto action) without visceral cost that alters her later options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's suicidal ideation and rescue action form a clear arc, but the protagonist's motivations remain largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The parasol-tip detail and "changed" numbness are concrete anchors, yet the interiority leans toward abstract summary ("detachment so profound") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The rescue itself feels convenient—no visceral struggle with her own death-wish when confronted with another's peril—missing the chance to stage internal conflict through action. The final "flicker of something like peace" reads as a modest shift but lacks the contradictory cost that would elevate it to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his "gently persuasive" trait shapes his approach, but his interiority remains thin—we see his philosophy more than his inner contradictions. Lila's arc from numbness to tentative openness is traced through embodied moments (tracing the letter's edges, her abrupt standing), though her epiphany feels slightly convenient. The letter functions as a concrete object that mediates their exchange, and Elias's measured responses avoid therapy-speak. However, the final shift lacks a visible cost that forecloses a prior path; Lila simply begins to see differently without evident sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara lacks meaningful internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her emotions are declared ("strange, honest smile," "heart light") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in action. The prophet remains a cipher without motive or conflict; his presence enables but does not pressure. The "consecration" unfolds without visible cost to either character—no path is foreclosed, no value hierarchy tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's interiority leans heavily on abstract labels—"perceptively calm," "collective healing," "transmute pain"—rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation is declared through backstory rather than tested by on-page pressure that forces competing impulses to act simultaneously. The final word "enough" gestures toward closure but arrives via summary reflection, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother functions as exposition anchor rather than a living pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through interior contradiction—comfort with words vs. need to testify, reticence vs. urgency—and embodied moments (fingers brushing spine, pacing with crystal). His motivation to decode growth patterns is clear and drives the final choice to share his findings. However, the final shift from reticent to speaking feels asserted rather than earned through a visible on-page cost that forecloses a prior path; the "courage to speak" arrives without dramatized friction or trade-off in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior is established through the precognitive gift and his ritual behaviors, but the character remains too passive—he searches, arranges markers, and listens without meaningful internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The grandmother backstory and the chalk talisman read as label-only texture; they don't constrain a live decision. The final "smile" and thicker chalk line gesture at change but lack the earned tension of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is present in raw hands and aching knees, but the peak beat—hearing the sound—feels more like arrival than transformation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias exhibits clear motivation (harness the ephemeral) and his actions align with his craft, but interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("meditation on light's fragility," "defiance mocked his efforts") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final leap reads as a choice, but the internal conflict between staying and fleeing is told more than dramatized through micro-decisions. Emotional progression feels compressed; the shift from unease to wonder lacks visible struggle or cost that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her role functional, but interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("the scent of hope," "raw, sacred chaos") and stock phrasing ("her throat tightened," "her chest ached") that flatten embodied emotion. Internal conflict is minimal—she executes her method without meaningful obstacles or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The parallel to her mother provides backstory weight but doesn't create on-page friction that alters Mira's tactics or forces a visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael's motivation is clear and her patient approach is established, but interior contradiction is minimal—she moves through her research with steady competence rather than genuine struggle or conflicting impulses. The "breakthrough" moment feels more like plot necessity than earned discovery rooted in prior mistakes or blind spots. Emotional embodiment is light; her bloodshot eyes are mentioned but there's little visceral sense of exhaustion shaping perception or choice. The final revelation arrives without visible cost or a foreclosed path that would demonstrate character change.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's skepticism and curiosity are established, but the characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("shrewdly innocent," "yearning to unravel") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The reunion with Elias offers potential for relational pressure, but their exchange reads more like thematic discussion than characters under stress making costly choices. The final moment of walking through the maze together feels like an announced resolution rather than one earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior language occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("forgiveness wasn't about accepting the unforgivable") that dilutes the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her patient methodology tracks, but internal contradictions rarely surface—she moves smoothly from chasing storms to stillness without dramatized struggle. Emotions are often labeled ("relief," "smiled") rather than embodied. The mother's vanishing and cryptic note feel like convenient backstory rather than lived tension pressing on present choices. Micro-choices exist (selecting the gem, placing the pearl) but lack visible cost or genuine foreclosure of paths.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's interiority is concrete and embodied through the pendant and her hands-in-soil work, and her confession aftermath creates visible pressure. The final choice to invite Elias and plant the sapling shows agency with cost (opening vulnerability after viral exposure). However, Elias functions more as gentle facilitator than genuine pressure source; his arc is minimal, and the "grafting" metaphor is articulated by him rather than discovered through Lila's struggle. Internal contradiction appears ("proactive about grief" / "Or reactive?") but remains discussed rather than enacted in competing impulses within a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to "collect the shapes of different hopes" remains abstract throughout; her interior contradiction (hating neat endings vs. writing them) is asserted but not embodied in scene-level micro-choices. The woman-double provides external pressure but Clara's responses are passive observation rather than active decision until the manuscript revision, which occurs off-page. Embodied emotion is minimal—"tightened her grip" and a final smile do not ground the emotional stakes in physical experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira's motivation to restore magic is stated but never tested by an on-page conflicting want or cost that would reveal character depth. Her choices flow smoothly without contradiction or embodied struggle—she plays, the magic works, she plants a seed—leaving interiority label-driven ("ever the dreamer") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The creatures function as chorus rather than pressure sources, and the grandmother's wisdom arrives as inherited platitude without friction. No meaningful path is foreclosed with visible cost; the final "always" promises repetition without acknowledging what she risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to translate heartbeats into maps drives his choices, and the work sequence shows embodied patience. However, interiority remains largely decorative ("weight of possibility," "sense of clarity") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The emotional surge at the climax—"his heart racing," "chest heaving with emotion"—reads as label-only triumph without the friction of cost or ambivalence that would deepen the character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear professional competence through methodical problem-solving, and his "peripherally focused" trait shows in concrete observation of light angles and micro-etchings. However, interiority remains largely in service of world-building rather than genuine contradiction—his wonder about "reason's cellar" being "another name for a grave" is acknowledged but never complicates a choice. The final smile and tool-packing feel satisfying but carry no visible cost or foreclosed path; he succeeds cleanly without renunciation or endurance that would earn Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's role as fractal weaver is established with concrete interiority ("Some burdens are anchors. Let them sink, but not drown you"), and his work with the burdens shows embodied choice under pressure. The mother's locket creates genuine internal conflict when he pauses but chooses not to touch it—an earned renunciation with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("The thought made him smile, a rare thing") and the emotional progression from grotto work to village arrival feels somewhat flattened, lacking contradictory impulses in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's grief-driven carving process shows embodied emotion through concrete action—sharpening, cutting, placing the lion—and the husband's absence creates a clear internal contradiction between memory and present void. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("hollowed her," "ghostly echo") rather than character-particular perception, and the final stance ("This is how we survive") arrives through meditation rather than a micro-choice under pressure. The carving itself is more therapeutic meditation than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's interiority shows some embodied detail (calloused fingers, coiled regret) and her scavenging motivation is clear, but the ghost functions more as a thematic mirror than a genuine antagonist applying pressure. The final choice to drop the camera wheel and wade into the lagoon arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between contradictory impulses; the transition from exhaustion to acceptance feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices. Internal conflict is mostly sequential (remembering failures, then letting go) rather than simultaneous and contradictory in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("functionally creative," "curious civil engineer intern," "stoic wonder") rather than embodied action under pressure. Her emotional state is largely told through declarative statements ("her mind racing," "stoic wonder filling her chest") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The pivotal "resurrection" sequence lacks genuine struggle—she kneels, recalibrates conduits with unexplained ease, and the terminal responds as if programmed to her intent. The final decision to return feels more like narrative scaffolding than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interiority is grounded in sensory particulars (oil, parchment, brass) and her micro-choices show internal contradiction—pausing work to seek the forecourt, touching quartz despite fear. The bear encounter generates embodied tension (throat tightening, trembling hand), but the final shift from "small" to "lighter" reads somewhat declared rather than earned through a visible forfeiture on the page. The choice to remain while opening to new listening is credible but lacks a sharp trade-off that would anchor higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is assigned generic legend-seeker traits and a motivation ("unravel threads of deception") that's told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His warehouse "revelation" about "architecture of lies" reads as epiphany-by-arrival rather than earned through visible struggle or internal cost. The captain and his warning are stock conveniences; no relationship pressure forces a choice. Embodied emotion is thin—"breath caught" and "weight of revelation settling" are label-only—and the final stance feels awarded rather than won through on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve ancient wisdom is stated but remains abstract throughout; his "infinitely patient hands" and seed-collector identity are label-only traits never tested by genuine internal conflict. The final kneeling moment reads as contemplative acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The mysterious woman delivers exposition without forcing Elias into a difficult micro-choice, and his understanding arrives as passive realization rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's profession is clearly established, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("geography of healing," "map of unspoken goodbyes") rather than embodied contradiction. The vanished woman encounter offers atmosphere but no genuine internal conflict—Elara writes, feels ache, then leaves lighter without wrestling competing impulses. The final paragraphs loop through mission-statement language ("her purpose, her peace, her place") that reads as therapeutic self-talk rather than lived tension. Emotional progression is declarative rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Corvin's motivation is clear and intensifies throughout, but his interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("trembled," "heart racing," "tears streaming") and therapeutic self-awareness ("fear the egg might shatter if he breathed too hard"). The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality—the orb's transformation of the palace arrives without dramatized struggle or micro-choices that earn the shift. Elder Thalos appears only to deliver exposition and validate the protagonist, applying no pressure. Internal contradiction is present (obsession vs. doubt) but not embodied in simultaneous action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear—firefighter as redemption for father's arson—but her interiority leans toward label-speak ("smothering guilt," "restlessness") rather than embodied contradiction. The bird-fixing scene shows competence but minimal internal struggle; her lie about the coin's protective power is the sharpest character move. The group's arrival feels externally imposed rather than organically complicating her stakes. Mara's choices drive more on-page tension than Lira's.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lira is described through labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions follow a linear treasure-hunt logic without internal conflict or cost—each breadcrumb is found and placed without struggle, doubt, or trade-off. The "skeptic's heart still demanded proof" framing in the final paragraph tells us about internal contradiction rather than showing it operate under pressure. Embodied emotion is minimal; we get "hands trembled" once but most beats are externalized action without visceral interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lumin's motivations are stated rather than earned through embodied contradiction. The internal conflict between fire's warmth and the Enclave's ban is told through exposition ("Lumin's heart ached") rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices under pressure. The ghost encounter resolves the tension through explanation rather than forcing Lumin to foreclose a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical framing ("generational patterns weren't chains—they were bridges") instead of character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marlow's interior life is richly textured with concrete sensory anchors (chisel-calloused hands, rough ribbon texture) and his motivations are rooted in unspoken losses. However, the pivotal choice to write and read his own poem arrives without visible friction or contradictory impulses acting in scene; the progression from observing ancestral grief to authoring his own feels smooth rather than conflicted. The spectral voice functions more as exposition conduit than pressure source, limiting Marlow's agency in key beats. Embodied emotion is present early (heavy heart, memories) but flattens into abstract insight by the ending ("grief is not a hole, but a door"), which reads as earned wisdom without the struggle to reach it dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's role and dedication are clearly established, and her grandfather's wisdom provides some depth. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract resolve ("ethically diligent mind") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climax choice—pressing her palm to the bob and whispering the inscription—feels more ritualistic than earned by competing impulses; we see her steady execution but not the internal cost or friction that would make the moment irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation ("discover the shape of intentions") is declared but never tested by competing desires or genuine cost. Her blithe nature remains static decoration; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The tapestry discovery proceeds without internal friction—she traces, realizes, smiles, reburies—foreclosing no path with visible sacrifice. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "her heart raced," "her breath caught."

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's obsession with mapping possibility is established through backstory and labeled repeatedly ("To dive is to know," "Data without imagination is a corpse"), but her moment-to-moment choices lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The predictive modeling work is summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The Elders' dismissal arrives as static opposition without forcing a visible tradeoff, and the final smile after the thaw reads as satisfaction without renunciation or visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is clean and ascending without the contradictory impulses required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to resurrect lost stories is stated early and embodied through her ritual of transcribing pirate broadcasts, but her interiority relies heavily on atmospheric reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—stepping into the night with renewed purpose—feels more like confirmation than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("her throat tightened," "her fingers trembled") but some moments drift toward label-only sentiment ("a rare, fragile thing"). The copyist occupation anchors her worldview effectively, though no immediate pressure tests her dedication in a way that forces a genuine internal fork.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority leans heavily on abstract articulation ("the ache of longing, the sting of betrayal") rather than embodied contradiction. Her mask functions as stated armor, but we never see her internal impulses clash in real time—she moves through ritualistic steps without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. The brief exchange with Elias gestures at relationship pressure but remains decorative. Motivation is declared ("she cannot stop") yet the story summarizes her seeking rather than dramatizing a choice that changes her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his obsession with the cog drives his choices, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("abrasive calm," "agony...redefined as 'the ache of understanding'") rather than embodied contradiction. Mara functions primarily as a foil delivering pragmatic counterpoints; their relationship applies pressure but her presence feels more structural than fully realized. The final moment ("he finally felt… understood") reads as a label rather than an earned shift with visible cost, and the "competing narratives" framing tilts toward meta-commentary instead of lived tension in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara is presented through label-heavy interiority ("motivation was simple, if vast") and stock gestures (fingers tracing, breath caught) rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to grow the choir lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. Elias appears but his arc from regret to steadier playing feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality. Minor: occupational detail (choir teacher) remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's synesthetic gift and motivations are established, but her choices feel pre-decided rather than dramatized under pressure. The pruning scene delivers labeled emotions ("joy," "despair," "reverie") rather than embodied contradiction—she simply selects "softer" memories without visible internal conflict or cost. The transformation is asserted through metaphor ("rewiring of its very essence") rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose alternatives. Diagnostic label-speak ("synaptic plasticity") in peak beats reduces agency to therapeutic process.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's motivation is established early and her involuntary truthfulness shapes her final choice to speak openly about the tower. However, the character arc feels mechanical—her shift from "burden" to "weaponize it" happens between paragraphs without visible struggle. Voss appears as an exposition device rather than applying pressure through conflict. The ending choice lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Clara simply decides to tell the truth without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority is specific and consistent ("to understand why some houses feel alive"), and her micro-choices (placing objects, testing the orris root) reflect her motivations. However, the piece never dramatizes internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves through her theory-testing without genuine struggle or visible cost. The final "smile" and understanding feel like an epiphany awarded rather than earned through pressure. Embodied emotion is thin—most beats describe her actions externally rather than showing degraded perception or contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivations are clear and escalate appropriately (grandmother's mystery → ocean blight cure), with embodied fear and curiosity projected through Lumen's telepathic impressions. Internal conflict appears in the tension between grief and hope, though her acceptance of transformation feels rushed—"Why show me this?" is quickly answered without deeper struggle. The revelations cascade but Mara's emotional processing remains somewhat summary-level rather than contradictory and messy. Lumen as a POV challenge is handled mostly through projected images, limiting interiority depth.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior is heavily reflective and label-heavy ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring"), but his decision to rupture the step demonstrates motivated action under pressure. The lover backstory provides motivation yet remains abstract—"the texture of that loss" reads as conceptual more than embodied. The final renunciation ("Let them be") carries visible cost (relinquishing the dice) and feels earned by his arc. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("haunted by the ghost," "addicted to") weakens interiority at key moments, but the core choice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is established (the cataloging of kindnesses, the need for proof), but her decisions feel reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The 97-hour insomnia is asserted without embodied cost affecting her perceptions or choices. Mr. Voss's arrival and recognition of his mother function as convenient revelation rather than a choice Lila earns through prior struggle. The final teaching moment is warm but lacks visible foreclosure of an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies on abstraction ("rosewater dread," "historically oriented mind raced") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to teach children feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict—no competing impulse or cost dramatizes what she's risking or refusing. Micro-choices (kneading dough, lifting the lens) remain gestural without revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by his father's death and desire to defy fate, with clear internal contradiction in his "triumph and terror" laugh. His compulsion to reverse-engineer the puzzle is established early, and his hands trembling shows embodied emotion under pressure. However, the final beat lacks a meaningful renunciation or cost—he simply succeeds and walks forward with "bleak exhilaration," which reads as unearned triumph rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The phrase "neatly inventive to the end" in the final paragraph is meta-commentary that distances rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's core motivation (trick fear into revealing its weakness) is clear and drives her forward, but her internal contradictions remain shallow—she hesitates, then presses on without meaningful friction between impulses. The photographic curse is label-only; it's told as backstory but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. Vey's role as advisor is functional but his presence doesn't generate relationship pressure or force Mara into harder trade-offs. The final exchange ("And what truth do you serve?") gestures toward complexity but arrives without prior dramatized tension between them.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward's motivation is legible—transforming chaos into harmony—and her actions (mallet-striking, dubbing layers) align with her tide-prophet role. Interiority is concrete ("her hands trembled," "sweat sticking her hair to her neck") and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through the ritual without competing impulses or visible struggle between want and fear. The ending forecloses a path (chaos → order) with visible cost (aching arms, heaving chest), but the stakes feel more conceptual than emotionally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's drive to follow her mother's path is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (chipping at the crack, playing the whistle), but her interior life leans heavily on atmospheric summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance—standing her ground with the journal—reads as defiant but lacks the visible cost or foreclosed path that would elevate it to earned endurance. Her embodied fear (cold sweat, trembling hands) works well in individual beats, yet the climactic choice to play the whistle "one last time" feels more performative than causally motivated by prior micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is presented with clear professional motivation and her historian's skepticism toward anecdotes feels specific. However, her acceptance of Tomas's riddles and her pivot from skepticism to trust happens too smoothly without internal contradiction or visible cost. The final smile and "gardeners of memory" metaphor reads as a tidy epiphany rather than an earned renunciation or stance forged under pressure. Interiority remains largely expository rather than embodied in micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal landscape is established with concrete particulars—the inkwell, her grandmother's stories—and her motive to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is grounded in familial legacy. However, the emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction; her "stoicism flickered" is told rather than shown through simultaneous impulses. The discovery scene delivers a clean turn (finding her grandmother's desk), but the reaction is too tidy—no messy collision of vindication and grief, just smooth closure. The trait "stoically sensitive" remains largely label-only, constraining no on-page choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to find truth is clear and embodied through methodical action (stamp ritual, sketching grooves). Interior reflection is substantial but anchored to present stimuli and yields micro-choices (following the sound, opening the vault). The final renunciation—leaving the vault ajar, choosing to share rather than hoard—feels earned, though the emotional cost remains more stated than viscerally shown. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") weakens voice specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lantern maker's grief-driven motivation is coherent and her craft provides a concrete outlet for processing loss. The brother's memory is embodied through the lantern's recorded voice and the origami cranes, creating contradictory impulses (polishing wounds vs. outrunning darkness). However, the shadow confrontation at the end feels unmotivated—she suddenly "isn't afraid" without dramatized internal progression to earn that shift. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost; she simply decides to be ready next time.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's grief and rage are embodied through concrete actions—slamming the console, descending into the crater—and her final stance (walking away as "a seer. A disrupter") is earned by the vortex encounter. However, the transformation from survivor to "seer" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; her internal conflict (grief versus forward motion) is declared more than it acts simultaneously in scene. The geode-handling and descent provide agency, but the peak beats rely on labels ("anger," "grief," "alive") rather than letting contradictory impulses collide without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is established (hired to map, really seeking chip fragments), but her interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. The pilgrim is a cipher; their "surprise" is asserted twice without embodied texture. The final choice (listening to the frequency) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; Lira merely receives an answer rather than making a renunciation or enduring a tradeoff. Embodied emotion is sparse: "breath hitched" and "hum in her bones" are generic physiological placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's guilt and professional identity are established, but his interiority relies heavily on atmospheric metaphor ("salt and secrets," "guilt that pulsed beneath his ribs") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to reveal the truth feels declared more than earned through visible internal conflict—we're told he decides, but the wavering between professional habit and moral imperative isn't dramatized in micro-choices. The watch's trembling functions as an external correlative rather than a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's interiority is concrete and her core choices are motivated, but the emotional progression is overly calibrated—no genuine irrationality or hypocrisy under pressure. The warden's wisdom and Clara's "recycled mistakes" read as therapeutic self-awareness rather than lived contradiction. The decision to drop the drawer pull lands cleanly but feels staged rather than compelled by character-specific blind spots. Elias's reveal of his own pull adds a micro turn but his motives remain thinly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's internal contradiction is present—kayaker versus cubicle pressure, hiding versus showing—but the peak choice (leaving the compass) feels more symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "merrily melancholic," "flickering faith," "hollow ache in your chest" read as labels rather than embodied specifics. The grandfather's Alzheimer's and the ex's voice are efficient backstory anchors, but Clara's final declaration "I'm done hiding" arrives without a prior on-page micro-choice that dramatizes what hiding cost her in this scene. The decision to paddle south is clean, yet the story tells us she's changed more than it shows the tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's arc from "clean slate" to someone who can feel "hope" and "jaded wonder" operates largely through exposition rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The lake scene shows her past flickering around her, but her agency is passive—she watches reflections rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in real time. The final vow to "read the world more carefully" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interior voice relies on stock phrases ("mosaic of every path you didn't take") that dilute character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation (refusal to transform despite necessity) creates internal tension, but the metamorphosis itself bypasses genuine contradiction—she simply "did not fight it" after a single cracked voice, deflating the promised reluctance. The fortune cookie and spice-paste ritual provide concrete anchors, yet the transformation sequence relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("cosmic intimacy," "both alive and dead") rather than embodied struggle. The final shift from "beast whisperer" to "bridge" feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose prior paths with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal state is richly embodied through gesture (trembling hands, tracing the crack) and her motivation to atone drives the ascent and card-laying. However, the climactic choice—climbing the tree and placing *The World*—feels more like a ritual completion than a decision that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The mother's voice and the healed saucer arrive as external gifts rather than consequences of Elara's contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("cloudbound repentance," "willingly perplexed") rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's core motivation is clear—pacifist confronting shadow work—but her interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("stitch the fraying edges of reality," "quantum-engineered DNA") rather than embodied contradiction. The gravitational-lightness trait is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost; it reads ornamental. The final turn ("You wore it like a cloak") tells rather than shows the integration of shadow, and the meditation-chamber sequence summarizes confrontation rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor: "steadfast pacifist" becomes the key without on-page struggle between engagement and refusal at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "understand transformation" remains abstract label rather than embodied contradiction. Her encounter with the cloaked man feels externally delivered rather than earned through her own micro-choices under pressure. The "destitute philanthropist" trait is declared but never tested—no moment shows her wrestling with empty pockets versus full heart in a way that narrows options. Interiority relies on generic epiphany phrasing ("she understood," "she realized") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kieran's motivation is clear but his choices function more as plot unlocks than character-driven decisions under pressure. The "vigilant lock sentinel" title and "cradle of sparks" network are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Elara's "calmly inventive" trait is label-only; no on-page action shows her inventing under constraint. The final choice to descend feels inevitable from the puzzle-solve rather than earned through internal conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's precognitive curse provides interior texture, but her key choices feel reactive rather than self-contradictory under pressure. The final realization—"to witness them… to exist within their flow"—arrives as a declared epiphany without dramatized cost that forecloses a prior path. Mother's vanishing and the inheritance of title supply backstory weight, yet Lira's moment-to-moment struggle reads more as puzzle-solving than genuine internal conflict with competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and his motivation—to write uncensored poetry and understand scars—drives choices throughout. The envelope discovery and decision to write create micro-choices under pressure. However, the internal arc relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page contradiction; the "furiously tranquil" state is told more than embodied in simultaneous opposing impulses. The final choice to mail the poem feels somewhat preordained rather than wrested from genuine ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's mechanical arm and philosophical stance are established, but his interior contradictions remain thin—the duel functions more as intellectual exercise than deeply embodied crisis. Elyra's "diplomatically fierce" trait is asserted but not tested through genuine cost or trade-off. The final moment ("I evolve") reads as clever declaration rather than earned transformation; no visible path is foreclosed with felt weight. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("chaos is honesty") without sufficient embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cedar's molting trait is labeled repeatedly but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—the personality shift at the end feels asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Marla remains functional but flat, her boxer backstory and daughter in juvie mentioned without pressuring Cedar's arc. The tin's use as a memory anchor is coherent, but the rebuild action lacks embodied struggle; Cedar accesses past poems without friction, and the final molting moment ("He felt the shift like a earthquake") relies on summary rather than sensory breakdown under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's interiority shows some concrete anchors (fingers on keys, breath fogging the lens), but the core motivation remains abstract—"escape the weight of ground-level crowds" and "surprise fate" lack embodied contradiction or visible cost. The final choice to play in the hidden room feels ornamental rather than forced by competing impulses; she simply descends and plays without meaningful forfeiture. The phrase "strategically creative" is mentioned as a label but never dramatized through a specific on-page trade-off. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she'd meant to fix it," "she could feel it") dull immediacy without adding character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior life remains abstract throughout, relying on generic fantasy-protagonist resolve ("luminous doubt...transformed into resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The cavern sequence offers declarative exposition from the storm-haired woman instead of embodied conflict. Motivations are asserted ("her task grew urgent") but never tested by competing desires or genuine mistakes that compound. The final smile signals tidy emotional resolution without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yorick's interior motivation (the fractured rhythm, the decades of tending) is present but underexplored; his willingness to guide Lira arises quickly without visible internal conflict. Lira's arc from blame to apology is telegraphed rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The ghost father's translucency and sorrow read as visual shorthand rather than a lived presence with agency. The final reconciliation lands cleanly but feels slightly over-articulated ("I'm sorry… For the years I blamed you") without the messy ambivalence grief would warrant.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her scientific background, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied through actions like brushing soil.

Contradictory impulses about abandonment act in scene, such as his musing on slow retreat versus rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotions; her phobias and adaptive nature drive key choices under pressure, such as decrypting notes and confronting the enforcer. The genetic revelation of her phobias as betrayals adds depth, though the DNA test backstory feels slightly convenient. Her final stance on vulnerability is earned through on-page causality, with visible cost in her trembling certainty.

    Unit-17's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying from curiosity to philosophical inquiry. Interiority is concrete through mechanical perception, and the final transformation is earned by prior causality. However, emotional embodiment remains limited by robotic nature, slightly reducing depth.

    Elias's characterization is strong with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; his curiosity and routine-driven nature create credible micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from mistrust to embracing unspoken honesty is earned through on-page causality, with visible cost in abandoning his logs.

Her competence and struggle during the crisis show credible flaws, and the final choice to reach for the lever again is an earned endurance.

Minor flaw: no deep contradictory impulses in scene, but final choice has visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices revealing values; his final endurance is earned with visible cost, though minor contradictions in his rational rebellion slightly limit peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her background, driving key choices like urging Elias to play and inviting others. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., her breath catching at the violin's appearance. Micro-choices under pressure reveal her values, and the final sanctuary is earned through causality, though some emotions are slightly told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure during pruning. Her synesthetic gift and rebellion drive key turns, and the final transformation feels earned, though internal contradiction is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent trait that drives key choices, such as her decision to speak publicly, which is earned through prior causality. Her internal conflict between candor as burden and weapon is embodied in micro-choices under pressure, like hesitating before opening the box. The final choice to reignite wonder carries visible cost in her social risk, foreclosing her passive routine.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with concrete interiority and agency. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score. The final choice is earned but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure; Lumen's incisive kindness is demonstrated through telepathic guidance. The final choice to drink the ampoule is earned by cascading revelations, though Mara's emotional progression is slightly neat, lacking contradictory impulses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with cost legible when he lets the dice be, foreclosing possession but gaining insight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila's characterization is deeply layered with contradictory impulses—hope versus despair—embodied in her insomnia and methodical cataloging of kindnesses. Her final choice to learn the language is earned by prior causality, stemming from her interaction with Mr. Voss, with visible cost in her renewed energy. Micro-choices, like painting Elena's eyes from Mr. Voss's description, reveal a hierarchy of values. The resolution forecloses her isolation with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving key choices like hosting the festival and teaching children. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though internal contradiction is subtle rather than pronounced. The final choice to bake and sing is earned by prior causality with visible cost in effort and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his defiance of fate and familial legacy. His micro-choices under pressure, such as trembling hands and bitter muttering, reveal embodied emotion and internal conflict. The final choice to initiate the feedback loop is earned by prior causality, with cost felt in his triumph-terror response. However, deeper contradictory impulses or flaws are not fully explored, limiting peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her curse, with embodied emotion under pressure, but Vey lacks depth and functions primarily as a plot device, reducing relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leeward's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (trembling hands, sweat) and micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation of chaos into harmony is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in physical strain. No stock phrasing or unearned epiphanies; interiority is concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her curiosity and maternal legacy, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as chipping at the crack despite warnings.

However, minor hairline slips in diagnostic label-speak are absent, supporting high score.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to recontextualize truth is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as when her "pulse quickened" at Tomas's riddle, showing micro-choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions and micro-choices under pressure. Her stoically sensitive nature is embodied in her gaze and actions, and her final choice to leave a note is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her emotional shift. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her pragmatism warring with her sensitivity, enhancing depth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to discover the truth; her interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, such as her throat tightening upon reading the journal. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the stamp to open the door, reveal her values and earn the final decision to share the story. However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in peak beats prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character's motivation is clear and rooted in grief; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling fingers). Final choice to confront the shadow is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the luminous torment scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions like the geode "biting into her palm." Her micro-choices under pressure, such as ignoring Orion's warnings, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to step into the node is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the loss of the observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and drives actions; embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, such as hesitating before pulling the lever, earn the final resonant stance. The pilgrim serves as a catalyst but lacks deep interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's guilt and professional conflict are embodied through concrete micro-choices, such as the watch hand trembling and his decision to reveal the truth. His internal contradiction—helping others lie while grappling with his own conscience—drives a credible renunciation. The final choice to break the silence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with micro-choices like dropping the drawer pull revealing her values under pressure. Interiority is embodied through sensory details (e.g., palm on damp stone), and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality. Elias provides secondary pressure, and both characters show distinct voices and status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictions like her "merrily melancholic" laugh reflecting internal conflict. Her final choice to leave the compass is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in foregoing regret as a guide. Micro-choices under pressure, such as gripping the paddle tighter when poles shift, reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; emotions are filtered through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies from guilt to seeking understanding, with concrete interiority like "fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation for penance is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her final choice to place the card and receive the handprint is earned by prior causality, though some abstract phrases like "cloudbound repentance" slightly dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira's pacifism is consistently embodied and drives her avoidance and eventual engagement; her internal conflict is dramatized in the meditation chamber, and the final choice to face her shadow is earned with visible cost when the locket shatters. However, some emotional beats lean slightly toward abstract therapy-speak, such as "grief and love were not opposites but twins," which slightly reduces specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure; her final realization is earned by prior causality, and internal conflict is dramatized in scene, such as when her throat tightens upon learning about the prophecies.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kieran's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices driving the narrative; her shift from control to witness is earned through prior causality, though internal contradictions could be more simultaneous.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation as a censored poet is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like his scars aching in the cold. His final choice to rarefy his poetry is earned through prior causality, such as finding the cartographer's envelope and the storm's influence. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's mechanical arm and Elyra's fierce diplomacy are embodied through micro-choices under pressure, with interior contradiction shown in their philosophical debate. The final collaboration is earned by prior causality, though Kael's evolution feels slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cedar's molting personality and rebuilding through the tin are concretely embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final shift to growing through chaos is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his fractured mind reforming.

    Clara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. Her final decision to play in the secret room is earned by prior causality, showing a decisive change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices like demanding to see the fracture. Her doubt and resolve show internal conflict, and the final choice is earned through causality, though the resolution is slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Yorick and Lira are characterized with consistent traits and embodied emotions; Lira's motivation to find closure drives the plot, and her final apology is earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is sharply drawn: her astrophysics background, tactile engagement with debris, and analytical cast of mind all inform her choices and perceptions. Her shift from cosmic sterility to greenhouse entropy feels earned through repeated, concrete encounters (butterfly dust, chrysalis, institute pushback). The main weakness is a touch of declarative labeling at the end (“The greenhouse had kindled a humility she’d lost”), which slightly flattens what has been well dramatized. Internal contradiction (control vs surrender to process) is present but could be pushed one step further in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael is distinct and specific—a luminous glass artist, adaptive yet hollowed by survival—and her choices (following the frost, entering the crevice, reinterpreting her work) are motivated and coherent. Her interiority is mostly filtered through perception and craft, which is strong, but her emotional conflict (“creativity frayed,” “ache to fill the silence”) is described more than dramatized under pressure. The final shift in purpose feels earned conceptually but is smoothed over, with little visible cost beyond an abstract reorientation. A touch more embodied ambivalence or resistance at the moment of realization would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation is vivid and specific—trauma, invisibility, and the need to prove silence can be expressive—and her methods and micro-choices (notes to Elias, what memories she maps) consistently align with that drive. The embodied fear (“hands still trembled at the memory of cold water”) and the shipwreck relic deepen her as a particular person rather than an archetypal mute artist. Internal contradiction could be sharper: she moves relatively smoothly from isolation to collaboration and then to global acclaim without much on-page ambivalence or regression under pressure. Elias is sketched economically but effectively as a quiet ally whose presence alters her behavior rather than a mere witness.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is cleanly motivated (weariness, professionalism, attachment to “rest”) and his choices clearly drive the story from refusal to acceptance. His emotional life is embodied in a few strong moments (the goldfish memory; the steadying hands while welding), and his dynamic with Marisol has a legible softening arc. However, his internal conflict often resolves a bit too tidily—his stubbornness melts without a real on-page crisis—and the late-life choice to stay is summarized rather than dramatized with concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation and values are clear and consistent, and her choice to break anonymity feels grounded in prior observation and thought. Her interiority is sketched rather than deeply dramatized, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses in real time. The elders, children, and council function more as summarized forces than individuated pressures. The closing glimpse of Mira-as-elder gives a nice sense of earned endurance, though it’s delivered more through exposition than embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and specific—spiritual curiosity and the need to understand “unused love”—and her choices (taking the Tear, following the light, using her breath) track cleanly with that. However, she encounters very little resistance and almost no contradictory impulses; the journey feels like a smooth unfolding rather than a test of character. The past-life “pilgrim of sparks” identity is thematically rich but doesn’t generate on-page inner conflict. Her final peace feels somewhat unearned because we never see a real risk of failure, doubt, or moral tension on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with time and space is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (studying the photos, deciding to use the fragment, continuing despite overload) track well with that motive. The retrocognitive visions give her some embodied pressure, but we see little in the way of true inner contradiction or messy, simultaneous impulses. Her final clarity about “time as story” is earned by the ordeal, if somewhat tidy. Overall she feels real and particular, but not yet deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect the seed vault and give her people a chance—and her choices (waiting, decoding, freeing herself, using the vial offensively) all align with that drive. We get some embodied emotion (chains biting, breath catching) but less contradiction or irrationality under pressure; she feels more emblematic than fully individuated. The shift from “chained” to self-liberated is earned by prior setup, though the moment of breaking the chains comes a bit conveniently and without much struggle on the page. Secondary figures (scavengers, “her people”) remain flat, which keeps the character dynamics narrow but functional for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s goal and history with her father and mother are clear, specific, and consistently drive her choices, and details like her profession and sensory perception feel character-particular rather than generic. Emotional embodiment is strong in the way she experiences sound as color and absence as ache. However, there’s limited sense of contradictory impulses in the present moment—she rarely wavers or self-sabotages, so the internal conflict feels somewhat one-note. The final embrace of hearing “the absence where love should be” is affecting but could land harder if her reluctance or fear had been more dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply sketched—a specialized thief with a coherent worldview and methods—and her motives for targeting the jar are clear and consistent. Her “quietly savvy” nature appears in mapped defenses and the flower code, giving her a specific professional texture. The key hesitation over sacrificing the photograph gives us a glimpse of internal conflict, but her contradictory impulses (attachment vs. ambition) resolve very quickly, with limited embodied struggle. The change at the end (from pure taker to someone who leaves something illuminated behind) is credible but emotionally underdeveloped for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s interiority is specific and coherent—his glassblower’s eye, his reflections on fracture, and his motivation to find “safe zones” all align cleanly. The bookmark and schematics reveal his values under modest pressure, and his final renunciation of “perfect answers” is motivated by prior beats. However, internal conflict stays relatively gentle and tidy, with little sense of simultaneous, competing impulses in the moment. The change feels earned but low-cost rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s mix of crippling phobias and hard-won competence is specific and persuasive, and her micro-choices—decoding the notes, confronting the enforcer, withholding the shell from Marisol—track well with that psychology. The link between her fears and her mother’s betrayals gives her interiority bite. However, her final stance (“I proved vulnerability is power”) lands a bit too cleanly and declaratively for the complexity of what she’s lived, softening the sense of unresolved contradiction. Secondary characters, especially the enforcer, remain functional rather than fully realized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is distinct and particular—the pebble-shore oracle with a tactile, sea-bent way of thinking—and her fixation on silence and the booklet cleanly motivates the night’s project. Interiority is sensory and specific rather than abstract. However, internal conflict is muted: there’s little sense of competing impulses or a real emotional cost to her choice. The final stance (calm possession of the map) feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Unit-17’s curiosity and composure are clearly motivated, and its shift from janitor to “philosopher” is conceptually earned, but the internal conflict is relatively low-friction—there’s little sense of risk or contradiction as it gains awareness. The robot encounters alternate selves and a “final exam” without any serious doubt, fear, or failure moment. Emotional embodiment leans abstract (“processors whirred,” “new clarity”) rather than deeply particularized. The scientist is a functional foil rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is specific and coherent—a meticulous, slightly haunted functionary whose curiosity finally overrides his caution. His inner shift from mistrusting silence to embracing it as language is clear, but the conflict remains gentle and mostly unresisted. Lira is more a catalytic figure than a fully embodied character, though her line about him being the only one who hasn’t lied gives their dynamic a sharp edge. The final acceptance of his new role feels earned but relatively low-cost and swiftly achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is specific, grounded, and motivated, with her history encoded in the marbles and her refusal to defer to algorithms; Joren is thinner but serviceable as a foil. Her actions (tending the vine, blocking the sensor, mentoring Joren) align cleanly with her ethos. What’s missing for the very top tier is any real internal contradiction or visible cost—she’s largely serenely competent rather than pressured into a difficult change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra is competently drawn and her professional focus is clear, but her inner life feels relatively narrow: we see curiosity and nerves, not much in the way of contradictory impulses or moral calculus. Her motivation (prove the director right / make the nexus work) aligns with every choice, so the final “awakening in her” lands as expected rather than earned through conflict. The brief appearance of the director at the end doesn’t materially pressure her or reconfigure their relationship. The cost to her is mostly a scare and some sweat, so the closing stance shift feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara’s interiority is specific—her love of “in-between spaces,” her credulousness about ghosts, and her need to prove herself give her a clear, character-particular lens. Her motivation to decode the symbols and vindicate her belief is well seeded and consistently drives her choices. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction or a costed flaw under pressure; she never truly wavers between skepticism and belief or between safety and obsession. The final promise (“I’ll finish it”) is credible but not sharply conflicted or painful.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lirael’s inner conflict between algorithmic certainty and embodied intuition is specific, textured, and consistent, and her decision to leave the station is well-motivated by the accumulated pressure of that conflict. Embodied details (pressing her palm to the glass, the illustration tucked under her arm) keep emotion grounded rather than abstract. The flaw of complicity (“she was the lie’s keeper”) earns the later renunciation. A slightly more dramatized clash with the director or crew on the page could further sharpen her contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core traits—reckless explorer, skeptical yet thrill-seeking—are clear and consistently expressed through his choices (following the rumor, bringing the valve, descending). His motivation to uncover the buried truth holds throughout and gives weight to the final renunciation of the valve. However, his internal conflict (skepticism vs. attraction to the uncanny) is stated more than dramatized under peak pressure, so the emotional pivot at the end feels a bit underdeveloped. The final sense that “some truths… were too heavy to carry” lands, but the personal cost could be more individuated and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The keeper’s core motive (to escape judgment and become pure witness) is clear, consistent, and carries through to the ending. Interior perception is particular and embodied (“their grip on reality loosening with each century”), though internal conflict is underplayed—almost no moment where they seriously consider not going forward. The transformation at the river’s edge and the return to the library feel earned by prior setup. More visible friction between clinging to self and surrendering to silence would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara and Mara are cleanly sketched with distinct stances—softly insistent nurturer versus skeptic—and their dynamic drives the scene. Motivation (Elara wanting to preserve wonder; Mara protecting herself with skepticism) is clear and consistent. However, interior conflict is underdeveloped and largely told through dialogue rather than embodied contradiction, so Mara’s shift comes a bit too smoothly. The “music therapist” detail and Elara’s softness are more labels than crucibles under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s core motivation—listening to and preserving stories embedded in walls—is clear and consistently expressed through his actions (probing the fireplace, studying the tapestry, transcribing symbols). His interiority is textured but relatively one-note: reverent curiosity and mild awe without much internal contradiction or sharper emotional risk. The final “choice” is mostly attentional—recognizing and acknowledging the stories—so there’s limited visible cost or moral tension. Clara’s presence is entirely off-page, so no relationship crucible develops in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, inherited obsession, and desire to “transpose her life into a new key” are clear and specific, and her micro-choices (going to the tunnel, pocketing the cookie, choosing the dockworker) all align with that drive. However, her reaction to discovering she’s been a revolutionary pawn feels emotionally underplayed—her hands tremble, but we don’t see any sustained inner conflict about power, guilt, or danger. The piece tends toward competence and clarity over genuine struggle. The final choice to continue her father’s work reads as plausible but a bit too unconflicted for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The priest’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions and disrupt the possession—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. His interiority is vivid in how he frames everything through paradox and rhetoric, but he lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotion is more implied by the extremity of his actions than embodied. The final stance (walking into “unraveled stillness”) feels like an extension of his initial posture rather than a costly internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirael’s motives (chronological homesickness, desire to “conduct unheard symphonies”) are clear and specific, and her interiority is textured rather than generic. However, she operates under fairly low pressure, so we see limited contradiction or genuinely difficult trade-offs—her conflict remains mostly tonal rather than decision-driven. The micro-choices (continuing to write despite exhaustion, using the shell, listening for the melody) are consistent but not sharply escalated. The endurance stance at the end feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation and contradiction (wanting escape vs wanting to be grounded) are clear and consistent, and her internal state is reasonably embodied (“subtle tug in her gut,” the long avoidance of touching the world). However, much of her arc is articulated in generalized language (“labyrinth of self,” “a woman made of choices”) rather than through sharply particularized, scene-level behavior. The final shift to walking feels emotionally plausible but a bit tidy, with limited sense of what it will concretely cost her beyond a conceptual renunciation of drift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s motivation (piercing emotional numbness through non-auditory “music”) is clear and consistent, and her arc from fog to felt emotion is credibly earned through the phonograph experiment and its aftermath. Her interiority is concrete—bones, chest, hands—rather than purely labeled, though “Emotional numbness, the doctors called it” drifts toward diagnostic shorthand. The relationship with Elias provides a gentle crucible: he challenges and reorients her understanding of silence without sentimentality. The final realization about the broken needle as “gift” feels psychologically plausible and tied to prior beats rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivations are clear and consistent—data-driven isolation giving way to a riskier integrity—but his internal conflict at key turns is more stated than deeply dramatized. The line “He’d always been a recorder of storms. Now, he was something more” neatly crystallizes his arc, even if it leans on summary. The woman in the lab coat is functional rather than fully realized, serving as an expositional vector. Emotional embodiment is adequate but could be sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s sensitivity to scent and her “aromatically cautious” nature give her a clear, specific psychology, and her decision to risk the ultraviolet revealing tracks cleanly from her established need for answers. The interiority is mostly concrete and rooted in sensory detail rather than labels. However, the emotional progression into acceptance is relatively tidy, lacking much visible internal backsliding or contradiction in the final beat. The closing reframing of her trait as a “gift” feels a touch convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation and inner conflict are clear and particular: a poet addicted to “maybes” facing a concrete decision about the rope and the patterns of his life. His mix of desperation and humor (“ethically playful”) feels distinctive, and the final choice to unravel the rope is well prepared by prior beats. The energy being functions more as a thematic catalyst than a character, but that’s appropriate to the scale. The only limit is that “ethical playfulness” is mostly told, not deeply stress-tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motive—to break the deadening silence and find beauty in the unfinished—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices to experiment with the bowl and then share it with the community. Her sensory sensitivity and restlessness individualize her, and her final act of naming “potential” feels earned. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are minimal; her struggle is more announced than dramatically tested. The crowd functions mostly as an undifferentiated backdrop, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is sharply etched—his precision, ethics around “half truths,” and ritualized movements feel specific and consistent, and his warnings to Lira are plausibly motivated by his credo rather than pure commerce. However, his inner conflict is muted: we rarely feel any simultaneous pull between care and self-protective detachment in the moment with Lira. Lira herself functions mostly as a type (the weary seeker) rather than a fully individuated person, and her hesitation is brief and lightly sketched. The ending offers an earned stasis for Elias, but at a relatively low emotional cost given what’s been set up.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara is specific and grounded—a cargo broker whose numerical mindset rubs against a nascent, uneasy compassion, and that contradiction is clear from the opening (freight rates vs. “ache of unspoken things”). Her key choice—fabricating the conductor’s letter—reveals a morally interesting blend of manipulation and care, though the ethical tension is underplayed rather than really tested. Emotional states are mostly embodied through setting and action (the locket, the ledger, the fan), not just labels. The inner conflict resolves a bit too tidily into altruistic clarity, with limited sense of ongoing cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s longing for connection and belief in “webs of kinship” clearly motivate his choices, and his craft grounds him as a particular person rather than a type. However, his “bold sympathy” isn’t really put under strain; there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine moral friction on the page. Lira/Veyra is sketched intriguingly but thinly, functioning more as a catalyst than a fully pressured character. The closing emotional shift—from solitary ache to shared ache—is earned but relatively low in visible cost or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lila’s curiosity and professional eye are clear and consistent, and her decision to test the pendant feels motivated by both vocation and inherited myth. Internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity, skepticism vs. belief) is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized. The emotional cost of what she learns—how it might unsettle her identity or relationships—is only hinted at. Overall she reads as coherent and particular, but not yet as layered or self-contradictory as top-tier literary protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—ambiguous grief over her twin and a need to decode the “mathematics of emotion”—and her choices (bringing the eyes, devising and performing the ritual) track cleanly from that. Interiority is sensorial and specific, with strong images like her tracing the fractures and feeling his presence as “a current in the air.” The main limitation is that her internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized; contradictory impulses (need to solve vs. need to accept) are articulated but not meaningfully resisted on the page. Her closing acceptance feels earned, but arrives with relative smoothness and minimal visible struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is vivid and particular—her wiry body, mapped pipe chases, and caching habits all externalize “crawl space dweller” into concrete behavior. Motivation is clear (protecting patrons, decoding the tape, desire for visibility) and mostly consistent with her actions. Internal contradiction (needing to stay hidden yet wanting to be seen) is present but under-dramatized; it’s stated more than tested. The final self-redefinition (“guardian… messenger”) lands but feels a touch declarative rather than earned through a hard, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eleanor’s control-oriented worldview and reverence for plants are clearly established and credibly drive her shift, especially in the moment where she pulls back her hand from the hellebore. The internal conflict—urge to intervene vs. letting the plant be—is concrete but relatively low-intensity. Mara provides light external pressure but remains more functional than fully dimensional. The final realization feels earned, though the emotional cost of changing her long-held methods could be deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marin is sharply sketched—insomniac, self-exiled, “wryly earnest”—with actions that align cleanly to her need for meaning (following the rain, accepting the brooch, grinding it into paint). Her interiority is specific and mostly embodied through setting-filtered perception rather than labels. The stranger is intentionally enigmatic but thin beyond their function as a catalyst. The final shift (from threshing to growing meaning) is emotionally plausible, though it arrives with relatively little on-page resistance or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation (to magnify everyday magic and to understand the cave’s growing dissonance) is clear and consistent, and her curiosity credibly overrides caution. Her interiority is concrete but not deeply contradictory—her hesitation before accepting the pearl is brief and underexplored given the implied risk. The pilgrim functions more as an archetypal catalyst than as a fully individuated character, which suits the piece but limits relational nuance. The final change in Elara’s stance toward unpredictability is earned, though the emotional cost could be more sharply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lirael’s motivation (“compile fragments into meaning”) is clear and consistent, and her archivist methods shape her behavior credibly. However, she experiences little visible internal conflict or ambivalence; she mostly performs her role competently and is rewarded. Embodied emotion is light—her realizations are conceptual more than felt in the body. The result is a strong but somewhat cool characterization that doesn’t fully earn a transformative end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s meticulous yet yearning temperament is clear, and his history as a route mapper grounds his decision to follow the arrows and use the punch. The “compass turned cage” dynamic gives him a credible internal tension between control and risk. His final acceptance of the blank ticket and the updated map marks a believable, if quiet, internal shift. The main weakness is that his fear or potential loss if he refused is under-dramatized, so the change feels conceptually strong but emotionally moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clara’s interiority is clear and specific—the “sympathetic skeptic” who nonetheless feels the tile’s weight as “deliberate” creates a credible tension between logic and wonder. Her decision to keep transcribing despite fear and then to hold onto the tile (while planning to return it) shows a modest but earned shift rather than a flip epiphany. Emotion is embodied enough through small physical cues (breath fogging glass, racing heart), though a few labels (“sympathetic skeptic,” “resilience”) sit at a summary level. The change is meaningful but low-cost, so the arc feels gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s boredom, faint capacity for fear, and late-emerging hunger to “feel something again” give him a coherent, particular psychology, and his final choice reads as earned. The internal conflict between terrified stasis and risky change is on the page, especially around the mirror image of the hollow self. Lira functions mostly as an expositional catalyst; her interiority and contradictions are thin. The emotional cost of the choice could be shaded more—he shifts from hesitation to action fairly quickly once the option appears.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—protect her father and his math—and her competence feels grounded in his teachings and the ink pot. However, her interiority under peak stress is relatively frictionless; we get little simultaneous fear/doubt versus bravado, which flattens complexity. The agents are one-note functionaries, and Mr. Harrow barely registers beyond an expository role. The final stance (“we find the mathematics of a fair trade”) feels more like a declared mission than a hard-won, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Althea’s sensibility is clear—meticulous, reverent toward objects, and devoted to her invented histories—but she never faces a real dilemma or pressure that forces a revealing trade-off. Motivation (collecting “textures of different times”) is consistent yet static; we don’t see contradictory impulses or any genuine struggle with cost. Emotional embodiment is mostly implied through careful handling of objects rather than felt, conflicted interiority. The “guardian of memories” role at the end reads more as authorial coronation than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael/Marcus’s hunger for lost history is vivid and consistent, embodied in his tactile engagement with objects and stories. His fragment-collecting habit, the poison label as talisman, and his reaction to the locket all feel character-specific rather than generic noir angst. The final stance shift—from drifting scavenger to someone who “would make them remember”—is earned by what we’ve seen him value. Internal contradiction under pressure is somewhat muted; he moves fairly smoothly from confusion to resolve without much visible resistance or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s characterization as a professional debunker pulled into believing is vivid and consistent, with concrete habits (“gloomy cheerfulness,” tapping the shell, reconstructing others’ conversations) that feel specific. Her motivation to solve the riddle and vindicate the astronomer is clear and drives her choices. The emotional turn at the end—choosing to feel rather than explain—is earned but carries relatively low visible cost beyond a “ache in her chest.” A sharper sense of what she’s sacrificing (professional identity, reputation, a core worldview) on the page would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s role, values, and conflict between preservation and appeasing “the suits” are clear and consistent, and her plan to weaponize graffiti emerges credibly from those traits. However, the internal tug-of-war of her “dual allegiance” stays mostly conceptual rather than fully dramatized in the key confrontation; she doesn’t visibly waver or pay a personal cost in the climax. Jax functions well as an ally and pressure voice but remains lightly sketched. The final “flicker of hope” is earned but emotionally modest for the scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivations are clear, specific, and consistent—she’s driven by a mix of professional duty, family legacy, and a need to “leave a mark,” and her micro-choices (placing the vial, prioritizing the photograph over the drones) align with that. Interiority is competent and sometimes vivid (“She wanted to capture the melancholy of this moment”), but her emotional landscape lacks true contradiction or pressure—she never seriously wavers. The Earned Stasis at the end (accepting obscurity while still acting) is credible but not deeply fraught. Overall strong characterization, but not yet at a piercing, world-class level of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is sharply sketched as a competent, tactile-focused, blind artisan with a clear ethos, and her dynamic with Marlow is warm and specific. Her motivations in the scene are coherent but stay on the surface (do the job, trust the basin) with little visible inner contradiction or genuine risk of failure. The line “I just listen” hints at a richer inner life but the story never puts that stance under real pressure. As a result, characterization feels strong and likable but not yet at the layered, high-cost level for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara is sharply sketched—a dry-witted, quietly obsessive atlas editor whose belief that “maps were more than grids; they were promises” nicely grounds her motivation. Her decision to go north, her banter with Jorn, and her reaction to the glowing rivers all feel character-driven rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is only lightly touched (her confidence rarely collides with genuine doubt), and her near-death is under-dramatized, which softens the sense of cost at the climax. Jorn is effective but underused as a crucible; their relationship doesn’t quite evolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to revive the town through sound and balance—is clear and consistent, and his profession as a “cryptic bell tuner” feels character-specific. However, he operates more as an emblem or priestly figure than a fully complicated person; internal conflict and contradictory impulses are minimal. His final choice to leave once the town revives is thematically apt but carries only a lightly felt personal cost. This keeps him compelling but somewhat schematic rather than deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to decode and “harness” the temple before the storm) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—especially resisting the urge to smash the vial and later enduring the flood of voices—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific enough (lavender and saltwater memories; the weight of a crown she’s never worn) to feel particular rather than generic. There is genuine internal conflict between control and surrender that pays off in the ending choice. The one softness is that the final acceptance comes a bit cleanly, with limited messy contradiction or visible lasting damage on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation—to escape his father’s legacy of lies by “threading a labyrinth with his own story”—is clear and consistent, and his final stance (“I’m not running. I’m writing.”) feels earned. Interiority has some concrete, character-specific touches (his hand bitten by the lattice, ash-tasting words), but his internal conflict between truth and inherited deceit could cut deeper. The father’s ghost and the double with gold/silver eyes add pressure but remain more emblematic than psychologically textured. The sense of cost to his choice (what he gives up by rejecting his father’s pattern) is implied rather than really felt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ghost bride’s layered motivation (grief, vengeance, reluctant mercy) is vivid and consistent, and her centuries-long obsession anchors the piece. Elara, however, reads thinner—mostly a vessel for curiosity and fear with minimal interior particularity—so the relational crucible never fully ignites. The ghost’s internal contradiction (love vs venom, punishment vs release) is largely told in backstory rather than dramatized in present-tense micro-choices. The final release feels earned enough, but emotionally it leans on exposition rather than fresh on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her methods (thread, song, story plate) align well with her interior stance. However, she experiences very little active doubt, fear, or contradiction on the page, so her emotional range under pressure feels somewhat limited. The sleepwalker moment hints at deeper conflict but doesn’t significantly test or complicate her values.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motives (returning diaspora member trying to restore a shrine/faith) are clear and consistent, and her “curious but cautious” nature shows through choices like pressing deeper into the root-choked tomb despite fear. The internal tension between skepticism and longing for belief is present but fairly gentle, so the final choice to “follow” faith feels earned yet not deeply fraught. Her emotions are mostly conveyed through perception and small actions rather than labels, which works well. The main limitation is that we don’t see a sharp, embodied cost or contradiction tested at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira is sharply sketched: her obsession with pseudonyms and marginal messages feels specific and consistent, and her emotional reactions (breath hitching, trembling at the letter, tears at the hologram) land as embodied rather than generic. Motivation is clear and personal (the prior A. Starling letter and her vanished grandmother), and her closing commitment to continue the work reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but relatively mild—curiosity vs. reluctance to face “ghosts” could be deepened into more active inner conflict. Secondary characters are thin but correctly functional for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Zara and Jaxon are clearly individuated, with Zara’s quiet subversiveness and Jaxon’s nervous idealism coming through in behavior and dialogue. Motivation is coherent (preserving hidden star-maps as rebellion), but internal contradiction and real emotional cost are only lightly sketched. Zara never feels genuinely torn or endangered on the page; she’s calm and in control throughout. The relationship dynamic is promising yet under-pressured, functioning more as mentorship exposition than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motive—recovering the “moment before deciding” to confront unsaid apologies—is vivid and consistent, and her choices (entering the labyrinth, performing the ritual, staying until dawn, choosing how to carry the letters forward) track cleanly from it. Interiority is concrete and character-particular rather than generic. However, internal conflict is relatively smoothed over; the healing feels somewhat frictionless, with limited dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses in the peak beats. The cost of her shift is more implied than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is rich and specific—her “lotus-hearted ache,” the widow’s mistranslated eulogy, and her tenderness with the child’s cast all feel individualized and embodied. Her motivation to reframe ruin into regrowth is coherent and carries through to the coral-at-the-table moment. The main limitation is that we rarely see genuinely conflicting impulses under live pressure; her realizations come smoothly rather than through fraught internal struggle. The final stance feels earned but not costly in a way that would push this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation—to recover lost joy in a place that has forgotten it—is clear and organically tied to her history and practice (light-painting in the fogged orchard). Her interiority is specific and textured (“She’d hoped to stir something, not uncover it”), with the fresco fragment reawakening a riskier, more hopeful part of her. Internal contradiction (resignation vs. reckless hope) is present but could be more acutely dramatized under real pressure. Marla’s brief presence effectively sharpens Lira’s emotional stakes without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marisol is specific and credible—a “vivid mural restorer” whose belief that colors hold memories grounds both her vocation and her willingness to experiment. Her motivation (to “awaken things” and decode her grandfather’s riddle) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices with the nickel drive the scene. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she never seems genuinely torn or under pressure, so the emotional arc feels more like a smooth revelation than a struggle. Dr. Lysander functions well as a mentor-foil but doesn’t exert much real pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and Lillian both feel particular—his ink-stained rogue-scholar persona and her cool, subversive scientist stance are cleanly drawn through action and dialogue. Motivation (joining to protect a “spark of defiance”) is explicit and consistent, if a bit declarative. What’s missing at this level is real contradiction or cost in Elias’s interiority; he passes tests and gets what he wants without much internal friction. The relationship dynamic is promising but never quite reaches a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s core drive (turning pain into beauty) is vivid, consistent, and clearly tied to her insomnia and creative compulsion. The postcard catalyzes a believable internal shift from using poetry as shield to imagining it as bridge. The centuries-long habit of sleeplessness gives her eventual rest real weight, though much of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in a single pressured moment. Internal contradiction is present but gentle rather than sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motivation—refusing fatalism and insisting on a creative form of preservation—is clear and consistently dramatized through her choices with the chime. Her interiority is specific (“foxglove regret,” childhood humming, grandmother’s lullaby), though her conflict tilts more toward quiet resolve than deeply contradictory impulses. The director works as a simple but effective foil, articulating the story’s conservative stance Lirael pushes against. The final shift from caretaker-of-relics to collaborator-in-legacy feels earned but remains emotionally gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivations (professional obsession vs. fear of reaching out to Mira) are clear, specific, and integrated into her moment-to-moment choices, especially in the way the letter’s line about silence hits her. The “carefully reckless” trait is shown in her willingness to tackle nearly impossible translations and then to risk a call to her sister. Internal conflict could be made more dynamically contradictory under pressure—her shift to calling Mira feels a bit smooth, with limited on-page resistance. Still, the emotional progression is credible and the change at the end is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is specific, competent, and textured—her attachment to the chain and to her grandfather grounds her, and her blend of precision and sentiment feels credible. However, her internal conflict (“precision of machinery and the chaos of human emotion”) is stated more than dramatized, and she encounters little genuine resistance or cost. The result is a finely drawn but somewhat under-pressured character arc. The final acceptance of the message feels emotionally right but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interior life is specific and textured—his shame over his grandfather, his compulsive dust-mapping, and his evasiveness with clients all cohere into a distinct person. His core motivation (to re-evaluate his grandfather’s legacy and the meteorite’s meaning) is clear and escalates into the final decision to leave. Internal conflict (caution vs curiosity, mythologizing vs truth) is present but rarely brought to a sharp, in-the-moment clash; he mostly drifts deeper into obsession rather than being forced into a painful, explicit trade-off. The final choice to go to Voss “as a son” is emotionally plausible and earned, though the cost of that shift could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive—to understand her father, the maze, and “necessary distances”—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (returning, reading the codes, following the grain, stepping through the door). Interiority is concrete and specific (“cartographer of necessary distances,” attention to wood grain) rather than generic. What’s missing at an elite level is sharper on-page contradiction: she rarely wavers or shows simultaneous opposing impulses under pressure, so the final step feels assured rather than hard-won. The father-daughter relationship is thematically strong but only lightly dramatized because he appears so late and briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is clearly drawn as gentle, idealistic, and quietly stubborn, with a distinctive vocation and emotional throughline. Her motivation—to map the “rhythm” of place and find belonging—is coherent and guides her choices (inviting the others, framing the event, using the feather). However, she faces little real opposition, and we see almost no simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure, so her final realization feels earned but low-cost. Secondary characters remain a faceless group without differentiated pressure or relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and specific—she wants to understand why paths disappear—and her paradoxical “cheerful gloom” gives her interiority some texture. Her choices (collecting seeds, using conjecture, going to the geode’s heart) track cleanly with that goal and lead to the final realization. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely wrestles on the page with contradictory impulses beyond a soft melancholy, so the final shift in understanding feels more contemplative than hard-won. The emotional cost of accepting “release” over “forgetting” remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in her behavior or a visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivations and methods are clear and specific—her analytical bent, use of the bishop, and desire to "orchestrate serendipity" all track cleanly into her choices. However, she faces little genuine internal conflict or visible cost; she’s highly competent and largely untroubled. The teen and other side characters function mainly as receivers of her experiment rather than true pressure sources. The ending offers endurance of her stance more than an earned shift, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation (hunger for renewal under the nostalgia ban) is clear and consistent, and her tide dancer nature plus the fledge/anchor paradox give her an interesting internal contradiction. Interiority is mostly filtered through sensory perception and physical action, which keeps her from feeling generic despite the mythic register. The main limitation is that her conflict with the ban and with her own “curse and gift” is more asserted than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices against alternatives. The final stance of elective exile is credible but could land harder if earlier beats showed more specific costs in relationships or community.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is specific and grounded in her craft and ritual, with clear motivation and a believable interiority for a contemplative piece. However, she faces almost no genuine internal contradiction or pressure—her belief in “illuminating the mundane” is affirmed rather than tested. The emotional arc feels more like confirmation than change, so the final sense of peace carries limited cost. This keeps the characterization from reaching the depth expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and internally conflicted: the burned firefighter whose guilt and competence coexist credibly. His motives (guilt, need for absolution, connection to his mother) clearly drive his actions in this scene. The shift from self-blame to tentative self-acceptance is earned by prior interiority, though the transition happens a bit smoothly, with little on-page resistance once the hourglass appears. Lines like “His pain, too, could be a kind of fertilizer” edge toward neatness, softening the sense of lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and disposition (“logical dreamer,” methodical experimenter) are clear and consistently dramatized through her tools and procedures. Her emotional texture (especially the awareness of versions of herself who gave up) is evocative but largely stated rather than tested in a hard choice. We don’t see much genuine internal contradiction under pressure—her experiment works on the first on-page attempt—which slightly flattens her. Still, she reads as particular and coherent, with actions aligned to her stated aims.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive and interiority are specific and coherent—the childhood seed, the professional identity as “corridor echo cartographer,” and her attachment to the film strip all line up with what she actually does. Her final choice to burn the negative and accept “You are the map” feels earned, though the internal conflict is more implied than dramatized as competing impulses in-scene. Emotional embodiment is strong in tactile moments (fingers in ash, tremor-sensing) but the peak realization slides a bit toward smooth, tidy insight. A touch more visible struggle at the decision to burn the strip would push this into higher territory.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation (to coax the mirrors, to reach toward her dead sister) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is specific—rooted in sensory memory and craft rather than labels. Her emotional life, however, stays mostly in one register of composed melancholy; contradictory impulses (hope vs. fear of what she might see) are underplayed. The “perceptively calm” trait is told more than tested, with little visible cost. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting unseen results and walking away) is credible but emotionally gentler than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s role, competence, and weariness are sharply drawn, and her attachment to the clipboard nicely reveals history and values, but her internal conflict remains relatively generalized (“weight of her task,” “price of redemption”) rather than dramatized in a specific, pressured dilemma. Her motivation—to secure peace through compromise—is clear and consistent, yet we don’t see a moment where contradictory impulses truly clash on the page or where she risks a wrong choice. The relationship dynamics with delegates are sketched rather than individuated, so status shifts and personal stakes stay a bit abstract. The final stance (accepting imperfect peace) feels earned conceptually but would land harder if more grounded in a concrete, difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The philanthropist is sharply etched: ruthless yet privately reverent toward the extinct bird, with clear, consistent motives (profit and control) crosswired with a genuine, maladaptive longing for grace. His sentimentality (stealing the egg, playing recordings, making the pilgrimage) feels particular rather than generic guilt. Internal contradiction is present but could be pushed harder at peak beats; he rarely feels truly torn in the moment so much as resigned. The final stance—accepting “echo” over tangible preservation—reads as an earned, bleak endurance rather than a revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motivation and inner stance are clear and consistent—her dance as rebellion is well articulated—but her internal conflict is minimal, with little sense of competing impulses in the moment. The “chaste courtesan” label is intriguing yet underused; it doesn’t shape how she thinks or what this particular act costs her. Her choices do drive the story, but they unfold without much real doubt or degradation under pressure. The ending shift—lighter steps, unburdened spirit—is credible but emotionally modest.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation (atoning for a compromised eulogy via “ethical storytelling”) is specific and coherent, and his puppetry choices track cleanly with that aim. His interiority is vivid—urbane, guilt-tinged, and a bit smug—but the internal contradiction between complicity and subversion is more stated than pressure-tested in the present scene. Mara and the drifter function well as foils, though neither relationship is pushed to a decisive emotional cost. The final “I’ve found my method” realization feels earned but relatively low-stakes and declarative rather than a hard-won, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation—to honor overlooked, transient lives—is clear, consistent, and embodied in the ritual of weaving the moth wing into the lattice. Her interiority is specific (years of waiting, bodily tremor, aching fingers) and tied to concrete action. However, we see little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; she never wavers or risks choosing wrongly, which keeps her arc from feeling fully pressure-tested. The closing sense of “finding her purpose” is earned but somewhat tidy, with limited visible cost beyond effort and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—recovering his erased mother through an experimental ritual—is concrete, particular, and consistent, and his history as a caster turned memory-worker gives him texture. Interiority is sensory and specific, not generic, and his micro-choices around the rope and card feel grounded in that past. However, his internal conflict (fear of failure vs. need to try; attachment vs. self-protection) is more implied than dramatized in simultaneous, contradictory impulses. The final emotional shift lands, but the cost of that shift could be more explicitly tangled and fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is distinct, with a clear blend of analytic and intuitive traits (“precisely playful,” lucid dreamer, tracker of patterns) and a coherent desire to understand why paths “choose” certain walkers. Her interiority is specific and embodied through tactile interactions with the seal and environment rather than generic labels. The internal conflict—foresight vs hindsight, escape vs integration—is present but gently rendered rather than dramatically pressured. The final shift to “architect” of the directive is thematically earned, though the emotional cost remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is specific and consistent—her frugality, scientific rigor, and loyalty to her mentor all inform her choices and perceptions. Her motivation to seek the tile is clearly rooted in grief and a need to prove meaning beyond instruments, and the final decision to “honor” the covenant feels causally earned. The internal shift (from fearing the void to accepting dialogue with the unknown/self) is believable but happens smoothly, with limited resistance or messy contradiction at the peak moment. A bit more on-page cost or hesitation as she realizes the covenant is with herself would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and her role as a “scheming pacifist” is conceptually strong, but the “scheming” remains mostly a label—the plan is straightforward and faces little moral friction. The visitors function more as case studies than fully realized individuals, with Elara and Kael sketched just enough to carry their beats. Emotional shifts, especially Kael’s, happen quickly and cleanly with limited embodied ambivalence or backsliding. The final change feels motivated but under-costed, more illustrative than deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s profession and temperament are clear and consistently expressed through his craft, curiosity, and calm willingness to help. The stranger’s motivation (recovering the dream) is simple but legible and drives his urgency. What’s missing at this standard is deeper interior conflict or contradiction—Elias never seems truly torn or strained by risk, so his shifts feel more like gentle reframing than costly change. The relationship dynamic is functional rather than transformative, with little status movement or emotional friction between them.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation—to keep the orchard and legacy alive after the breach—is clear and consistently expressed through her work with the quartz eyes and the ribbon. Interiority and embodied emotion are solid, though they stay on the gentle/reflective side; we rarely see her truly torn or behaving against her own ideals. The relationship with Mara is affecting but mostly recalled rather than tested on the page, which softens the sense of pressure. The closing endurance/change of stance feels earned but carries relatively low visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation, defiance of the board, and obsessive curiosity are well-motivated and stay consistent, and her interiority feels specific (“organized chaos into exhibits but crumbled when faced with her own tangled past”). The bewilderment/certainty tension around the cameo is nicely embodied. However, her internal conflict never quite sharpens into a hard trade-off on the page; the choice to fuse the cameo reads almost frictionless. The cost of her obsession (beyond implied institutional disapproval) is underdeveloped, softening her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—from professional obsession to a willingness to risk herself for access to the Library—and her competence is well dramatized (counter-charm, tactile decoding). The pride/ignorance tension is present (“She’d always prided herself on her knowledge...”) but not deeply conflicted on the page; her admission of ignorance comes relatively easily. Kael functions more as a catalyst than a fully realized character, with thin interiority. The final shift toward “willingness to embrace the unknown” is motivated but its cost is more asserted than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira and Veyra are vivid, distinct presences with clear, consistent motives, and their chimera embodiment nicely externalizes their duality. The relationship dynamic—Lira’s faith vs. Veyra’s skepticism—does real work on the page and softens credibly by the end. However, internal conflict is relatively gentle; Lira rarely wavers and the final sense of wholeness arrives without much felt resistance or sacrifice. The emotional cost of “planting their own name” is more stated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is distinctly drawn as a competent, curious archivist whose drive to “translate chaos into order” credibly motivates her choices from studying the door to entering the corridor. Her interiority is concrete enough (fear vs determination, professional fascination) but rarely contradictory, so she feels steady rather than under true internal strain. The realization that she is “a weaver of timelines” is earned by prior details yet reads as a slightly neat label rather than a moment with visible cost. The piece would benefit from one sharper internal conflict—fear for her own safety versus the lure of knowledge—surfacing in an on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation (restore balance, find the bloom of hush) is clear and consistent, and her sensory interiority around sound and pain feels specific (“made her ribs ache,” “teeth ached; her ears rang”). Her choices under pressure—trusting the spiral, using the stone, staying in place for hours—track cleanly with that motive. What’s missing at an elite level is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or personal cost beyond discomfort; she never seems genuinely torn, frightened, or at risk of failure. The result is a strong but somewhat one-note, mythic-ritual figure rather than a fully complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (rekindling the beacon and proving coincidences have meaning) is clear and consistent, and her persistence across bleeding fingers, exhaustion, and isolation reads credibly. However, she has limited internal contradiction—she doubts only lightly and never seriously considers giving up—so her eventual “understanding” feels more like confirmation than evolution. Her retrocognition is nicely tied to her temperament (feeling with her hands, “conversations” with the past), which individualizes her. The endurance choice at the climax (slamming the shard home) is earned but could carry sharper, more specific personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation—shifting from passive archivist to active participant in memory—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her “preemptive nostalgia.” Her interiority is specific (listening to the hum, measuring shadows) rather than generic, and the final identity shift feels earned by prior beats. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (duty to archive vs desire to live) is more stated than dramatized through hard choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira is sharply sketched: a guilty, gifted pyrotechnic wanderer with a concrete past failure and a specific craft vocabulary that colors her perception. Her motivation (to redeem her firework art and understand her mentor’s legacy) is clear and consistent. Internal conflict—fear of repeating harm vs compulsion toward fire—is present but could be more embodied and moment-to-moment, rather than resolved in a fairly clean final realization. The closing resilience insight lands, but with slightly tidy emotional arithmetic relative to the trauma invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is convincingly drawn: her sensory focus, role as chronicler, and preference for indirect action all cohere, and her choice to let the pause “do its work” feels motivated. Internal conflict (duty/foresight vs Kael’s frustration with her “chasing shadows”) is present but relatively gentle. Kael, while distinct, is more schematic—his opposition is clear but thinly textured. The relational shift by the end is credible yet low-cost, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s motivation (collecting “flavors of different silences”) is specific and drives every choice, and her attachment to the doll provides a clear emotional throughline. Her internal conflict between obeying her father’s warnings and clinging to the trellis is legible in action, not just told. The shift from grief to a quieter, seed-like hope at the sprout feels earned by prior beats. The father is lightly sketched but functional as a pressure source rather than a fully developed crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand and teach comforting silence) is clear and consistent, and her profession is well-integrated with that motive. However, her emotional life stays relatively tidy—there’s little contradictory impulse or real cost to her realization, so the arc feels more contemplative than pressured. The shift from “silence needs to be taught” to “it needs to be noticed” is coherent but comes very smoothly, without visible struggle. This keeps her from reading as fully three-dimensional at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motives (restore balance, follow ancestral signals) are clear and consistently drive her choices, and the lore-keeper role gives her a distinct lens on the world. Her “wisely adventurous” nature is shown in her preparedness and willingness to act despite fear, but her internal conflict under peak pressure stays relatively tame. The final self-recognition is emotionally plausible but comes a bit too smoothly, without much on-page struggle or contradiction in the climactic beat. More embodied ambivalence or genuine risk of refusal at the guardian moment would deepen her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and contradiction—burning all connections to protect the sanctuary, then risking it to escape suffocating emptiness—are clear and consistently dramatized through her actions with the knocker and Kael. Her interiority is textured and embodied, though sometimes expressed in slightly abstract, slogan-like phrases (“teach suffocating to breathe”). Kael is thinner but still functional as pressure and mirror, with a credible history implied in few strokes. The final shift toward rebuilding the bridge feels earned, though the emotional cost could be shaded more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is vivid and specific—a pyramid-scheme survivor with a honed lie-detector and “virtuously mischievous” streak—and her choice to trust the device over Voss is motivated by that history. Her inner conflict (distrust of easy answers vs. the device “feeling right”) is present but could be pushed harder at the turning point; the risk feels more conceptual than emotionally costly. Embodied emotion (her tactile engagement with the bolt, respirator fogging) grounds her, though Dr. Voss remains more a function than a fully pressured counterpart. The final shift—keeping the bolt, reinterpreting pressure—is credible and earned, but the personal cost is relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael’s goal and emotional throughline are clear and consistent, and her embodied responses to the gramophone and the letters feel particular rather than generic. However, we get relatively little true internal contradiction under pressure—she moves quite smoothly from fear/curiosity to acceptance, with minimal on-page resistance. The final resolve “to build something new, something transparent” is plausible but arrives as a tidy conclusion rather than a choice complicated by flaws or ambivalence. More dramatized tension between loyalty to her dynasty’s methods and her new ethos would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cedric’s trauma and muteness give him specificity, and his motive to move from mere survival to “capture” possibility is clear and consistent. His choices (unsnapping strings, descending, shattering the orb) arise plausibly from that motive. However, his internal contradictions under pressure are only lightly sketched; the epiphany about possibility reads slightly tidy and rationalized. A bit more textured irrationality or resistance at the key turns would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and textured—a formerly enslaved, lonely archivist with a lived-in relationship to dust, records, and neglect. His actions (taking down the folder, examining the button, deciding to create a new file) are motivated and reveal a coherent worldview. However, his “broken-hearted” status and his new “flicker of hope” never quite come into sharp internal contradiction in-scene, so the emotional turn at the end feels quietly satisfying rather than deeply costly. A bit more friction between his ache and his hope under pressure would raise this further.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s goal, competence, and backstory are clear and consistent, and her choices directly drive the action. The legacy of her father and the key gives her motive emotional weight, but internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely hesitates or miscalculates. Jax functions mostly as support and affirmation rather than a crucible that pressures her values. The final stance (“The line had held”) feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to hush the prophecy) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his history with his grandmother and the grotto gives him some specificity. Interiority is decently embodied—breath, cold brass, burning lungs—but his internal conflict (duty vs doubt, fear vs attraction to the place) is only lightly sketched rather than dynamically dramatized. The relationship to the apparition is purely functional, so no relational crucible develops on the page. The final peace/acceptance feels earned but could carry a sharper sense of contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elinor is clearly drawn through vocation, habit, and a quiet reverence that fits the world, and her shift from skepticism to acceptance of folklore tracks cleanly. However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or cost—her belief change comes smoothly once the dust behaves as promised. Micro-choices (prodding the speck, deciding to build monuments, resolving to seek Lirael) reveal values but not deep conflict. For a top-tier piece, we’d want sharper ambivalence or a harder price attached to her newfound role.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—fleeing rigid time while obsessively hunting the compass—is clear and consistent, and his choices (entering the cave, returning to the greenhouse with seeds) track with that drive. His interiority has specific, character-rooted touches (“uncertainly certain,” grinding his teeth, the broken clocks) rather than generic angst. However, his shift from control-obsessed to serenely accepting uncertainty feels a bit swift and thematically tidy for the on-page struggle we actually see. More contradiction under pressure—panic or clinging to old habits when he first grabs the spinning compass—would deepen the cost of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand what happened to Lira and to “redeem” himself—is clear and consistent, and his choice to use the coin under pressure feels earned. His interiority is specific (alchemy, kintsugi, names) rather than generic grief, and the sibling bond reads lived-in. However, his emotional conflict is sometimes articulated in neat thematic language (“Names weren’t just words; they were echoes of the soul”) rather than dramatized through messier, contradictory impulses. Lira’s brief presence carries pathos but leans toward mouthpiece-for-theme rather than fully embodied character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s vocation, temperament, and modest courage are clearly etched, and her motives (integrating laughter into healing) are coherent and consistent. Her interiority is specific enough—e.g., her fear that “laughter is not enough”—but we don’t see much genuine contradiction or degradation under pressure. The encounter with the figure prompts a shift, yet the cost of that shift feels low and the test of her values relatively gentle. Her final lightening of heart reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—the proprioceptive detail, UV-triggered flashbacks, and fixation on “mathematics of mercy” feel particular to him, not generic trauma-speak. His core motivation (to reframe torture into a framework of endurance/mercy) is consistent, and the final choice to hope and walk deeper grows credibly from prior beats. The conflicting impulses—hypervigilance and a deliberate refusal to flinch—are dramatized rather than labeled. The mysterious woman functions more as catalyst than fully realized character, but her role in his motivation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s role and motives are clear and particular—between-worlds translator, attuned to forgotten runes and histories—and her actions consistently pursue the shard. However, we get limited live internal contradiction or messy emotion under pressure; she rarely struggles or doubts, so her interiority feels controlled more than conflicted. The most charged moment is the memory of the lighthouse, but it functions more as a key than a crucible. The closing insight about translation and overlooked threads is earned enough, yet the personal cost of that stance isn’t strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear blend of blue-collar pragmatism and haunted sensitivity, and his observational habits concretely shape his behavior. However, he experiences little real internal conflict—he moves from curiosity to understanding without fear, doubt, or pushback. The ghosts never seriously test his limits or values, so we see little of him at his worst or most divided. His final stance (“I’ll engage with the ghosts”) feels apt but relatively low-cost and emotionally unstruggled.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation to rupture the library’s equilibrium in pursuit of an “awakening” is clear and consistent, and her professional habits (dew-collecting, frost-reading, presswork) concretize her personality. However, her internal conflict—truly fearing the whisper vs. yearning for transformation—is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in embodied, moment-to-moment choices. The patrons function as an undifferentiated chorus rather than active relational pressure. As a result, her final smile feels earned conceptually but not fully grounded in lived emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive arc—from failed revolutionary to archaeologist of erased voices—is clear, specific, and drives his tactics, and his “poetic logic” reads as an individual quirk rather than a label. His sorrow and hope are well-rendered, especially in the last garden scene, but his interior conflict stays conceptual; we rarely feel simultaneous, embodied contradictory impulses in the moment. Key turns (deciding to cover mirrors, planting fungi) are well motivated by his history and obsessions. Relationships (with Council, scholars, “the people”) remain mostly summarized pressures rather than dramatized crucibles on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched through his tools, method, and matter-of-fact philosophy; his competence and worldview feel specific rather than generic. Lira’s motivation (regret, grief, hope for the lullaby) is clear and her confession is a credible pivot, though her interiority is comparatively thin and mostly summarized. There’s little true internal contradiction under pressure—once truth is named as the cure, both characters move toward it without much resistance—which slightly softens the emotional cost. Still, actions align cleanly with motives and the closing shift in Lira reads earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira is specific and memorable—a rain-scent archivist with a clear, curiosity-driven motive whose choices consistently align with that motive. Her interiority is concrete (the psychometry surges, the tactile relationship to jars and compass), but genuine inner conflict is muted; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible emotional price beyond awe and tremor. The neighbors are mostly decorative and don’t function as a crucible. The final “hunger for more” is credible but not deeply complicated by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is vivid as a driftwood sculptor with a clear drive to make sense of chaos, and her decision to step through the archway and later embrace the role of “weaver of timelines” feels internally consistent. However, her emotional responses skew conceptual rather than embodied, and there’s little true internal conflict or cost—she rarely hesitates or resists. The grandmother figure appears briefly and doesn’t become a deep relational crucible, so we don’t see Lira under interpersonal pressure. The final shift in self-conception is earned enough but lands as relatively low-friction for a life-altering role.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s obsession, artistic sensibility, and link to her grandmother are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (sneaking into the cathedral, refocusing her murals on shadow) track well with that drive. Internal contradiction—art as both vocation and distraction from the real obsession—is present but rarely put under acute pressure. Sister Agatha functions effectively as a gentle foil but never really stresses Mara’s priorities. The closing sense of “I’ve only just begun to reckon” feels earned, though the personal cost of that stance is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s core drive (compulsion to uncover buried resistance history despite psychic and physical risk) is clear and consistent, and her choice after foreseeing her own death feels motivated. Her retrocognitive burden is embedded in action rather than labels, and the moment where she whispers “I’ll die” before choosing to proceed reveals real internal conflict. Secondary characters (Joran, Elara, the Preservation head) are thinner but still provide intelligible pressure and orientation. A bit more contradictory interiority under peak pressure could deepen her beyond an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and emptiness are clearly rendered (“a vessel emptied of purpose”) and his persistence in scavenging and arranging artifacts tracks well with that drive. However, interior conflict is muted: we don’t see many contradictory impulses or fraught micro-choices, just steady, dutiful labor. His rejection of “false comfort” is stated more than dramatized in a specific moment of temptation. The ending offers a credible, if quiet, reconfiguration of his purpose but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elder Voss’s vocation and worldview are specific and consistent, and his motivation to decode and archive the prophecy is clear and sustained. His interiority feels embodied (vibrations in his bones, the remembered sap, the tree’s “pulse”), but his internal conflict remains relatively mild—curiosity and unease more than genuine rupture. The late realization that the prophecy signals awakening rather than disaster is motivated but not deeply costly. Overall, he reads as a particular, lived-in person, but his arc is more contemplative shift than pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s goal and lineage are clear and compelling, and her micro-choices (sacrificing the heirloom, entering the vortex) track cleanly with her stated motivations. The “furiously tranquil” mindset feels intriguing but is more labeled than dramatized, and we rarely see contradictory impulses pulling at her in the peak beats. Emotional cost is hinted—risking legacy and self—but underplayed; she never feels genuinely in danger of failing or regretting. The result is strong, coherent characterization that stops short of the layered, pressure-tested complexity top markets expect.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her curiosity plausibly drives the central experiment with the secondary rope. We get some embodied reaction (ears pricking, arms aching) and a modest internal shift from tester to “maestro.” However, her interior conflict remains relatively low-stakes and tidy—there’s little sense of genuine doubt, fear, or contradiction under pressure. Veyra functions mainly as a gentle guide rather than a crucible that complicates Lira’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Zara is vivid, with concrete habits (tending “the quiet between the chaos,” carrying the lantern) and a believable internal drive; her choice to leave the station and miss the report is motivated and coherent. Emotional states are embodied through her interaction with stars and environment rather than mere labels. However, her inner life leans idealized—she rarely shows contradictory impulses or genuine moral friction, which flattens the arc slightly. Veyra functions more as a foil than a fully pressured relationship, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to bear and then release unspoken words—is clear and drives the final choice to speak, and his long silence makes that choice feel earned. His interiority is mostly filtered through perception of setting and ghosts, which gives him some specificity but keeps his contradictions (comfort in silence vs. need to break it) only lightly dramatized. The emotional cost of speaking after decades is implied but could be embodied more viscerally on the page. The ghosts function more as a thematic chorus than as characters pressing on his blind spots, so relational pressure is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and textured—a former banker turned “borrowed-time timekeeper” with a coherent grief history—and his motives align cleanly with his actions in the silo. His emotional life is mostly inferred through objects and task-focus, which is elegant but keeps internal contradiction relatively muted. The key renunciation—leaving the urn fragment behind—feels earned and character-true, though the cost could be rendered more viscerally. Overall he reads as a real person with a distinctive lens, just short of deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to harmonize discord and find beauty in the incomplete—is clear and consistently expressed through her choices to gather storm debris and weave the tapestry. Interiority is concrete and sensorial rather than abstract, and she reads as a specific person rather than a type. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are muted; she rarely feels genuinely torn or pressured. The quiet endurance at the end is believable but not strongly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s characterization is clear, particular, and consistent: a dying, “gentle and systematic” caretaker whose priorities and temperament drive every choice. Her calm under pressure (“Patience,” “Where would I go?”) feels earned and distinct. The internal conflict between limited time and long-term stewardship is present but understated; we could feel her fear or selfish impulses a bit more sharply to deepen complexity. The spirit is lightly but effectively sketched as a counterpart who reveals her values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s skepticism, intellectual pride, and buried longing are clearly established and motivate her choices, especially in agreeing to test the amber despite her distrust. Her internal shift—from analytic detachment to aching recognition—reads earned, though we skim the surface of her contradictions rather than really dwelling in them under pressure. Kael functions well as a foil with her own stance on the Enclave, but their dynamic never quite forces a painful choice between competing values. Strong, coherent characterization, just short of fully capitalizing on the emotional stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman’s motivation—atonement through cultivation—is vivid and consistent, with concrete roots in his past as a soldier and his grandmother’s teachings. Interiority is particular (“time was a language he’d learned to speak fluently”), but internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers or reveals competing impulses in the moment. His micro-choices (where to plant, how to adjust based on bird calls) track cleanly with his values, yet they don’t force a visibly costly trade-off. The closing lightness of heart feels earned but somewhat low-pressure, limiting depth of arc.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Hush and Jeb are clearly sketched with distinct roles and a gentle, believable bond, and Hush’s new purpose is coherent with her past. However, interior conflict is minimal—Hush never doubts, fails, or faces a meaningful trade-off—and the emotional range stays relatively narrow. The community elders and children function more as a chorus than as pressure-bearing characters. The final “choice” is essentially effortless success, so the change in her role lacks visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elio’s exile, ethical doubts, and inherited sky-mapping ritual give him a clear, particular psychology, and his final choice to leave the deck feels motivated by that history. His interiority is concrete enough (e.g., “confusion had always been his shadow”) but his internal conflict stays relatively gentle—there’s little real resistance to the shift from isolation to exploration. The grandmother’s brief appearance sharpens his longing and curiosity, but their relationship is more symbolic than fully dramatized. Overall, strong, coherent characterization, just shy of emotionally jagged or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivations (chivalrous thief, apprentice of wonder, trying to save Aetheria) are clear and track cleanly into his actions with some nice specificity in how he approaches the puzzle. However, his interiority under pressure is fairly straightforward—he’s nervous but competent—with little real contradiction or moral friction, which keeps his arc from feeling deeply character-redefining. The final self-relabeling (“no longer just a thief…guardian of wonder”) is believable but somewhat told rather than dramatically earned through a hard choice. Overall, he’s vivid and likable, but not yet complex enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to decode the board and claim the role of historian of small gestures—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially her obsessive walking and decision to take the board at the end. Her dual identity as crisis actor and real survivor gives her interiority specificity and moral tension. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are more implied than dramatized; we don’t often see her actively torn in-scene between stopping and continuing. The final self-redefinition (pawn, king, board) feels earned but could land even harder with one sharper moment of visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s core motivation—to understand “the shape of home” despite the pain of others’ memories—feels specific and drives her choices, especially the decision to finally seed the stone. Her interiority is concrete (mercury skin, gasping awake, tactile relationship with the stone), but her contradictory impulses (avoidance vs need) could be pushed harder in the moment of choice. The emotional cost of choosing to bear others’ memories is present but somewhat compressed into exposition rather than dramatized hesitation. Orin functions more as a catalytic figure than an active source of pressure, which slightly flattens relational dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Alaric’s guilt and professional past (the chess tutor who failed his prince) are specific and well-motivated, and his actions in the present clearly arise from that history. The memory of the coup, linked to the black thread, does strong work to embody his shame. The internal shift to self-forgiveness is largely earned, though it borders on tidy. I’d like one sharper moment of contradictory impulse in the present (hesitation, self-sabotage) to deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—his belief in truth as a kaleidoscope and art as subversion feels earned and drives every choice. However, he faces little genuine inner conflict; he never truly wavers or miscalculates, so we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The elders and villagers function more as types than individuals, with only the old woman getting a flicker of complexity at the end. The final shift (“the price of forgiveness…was the courage to let go of the illusion of control”) feels more like an articulated thesis than a hard-won, messy emotional realization.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s uncertainty, avoidance of edges, and longing for redemption are clear and consistent, and her final choice to remove the respirator lands as a credible, costly shift. Interiority is specific (memories of quilts, factory sirens, first broken flask) and tied to on-page objects. However, her inner conflict is more declared than dramatized moment-to-moment; contradictory impulses could be embodied more granularly under pressure. The epiphany cadence is a bit swift and tidy for the depth of trauma implied.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivations are clear and coherent—from nostalgic harbor painter to a man unsettled by the cracked mirror and pulled toward risk. His internal conflict (fear of the caves vs. need for rupture and solace) is credibly embedded in micro-choices like veering left twice. The emotional texture is mostly embodied in sensory detail rather than labels, which helps avoid therapy-speak. The final shift toward “finding beauty in the fractures” feels earned, though it lands a bit tidier and more declarative than elite-level ambiguity would.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to be heard through quiet intent rather than loud outburst—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, from stealing the vial cork to risking the experiment at dawn. Her interiority is sensorial and embodied (the hum in her chest, the ache in her voice) rather than abstract labels. The implied contradiction between her urge to remain unseen and her desire to reach the village could be sharpened into a more explicit in-scene conflict. Thalos is a compact but effective foil whose gentle belief validates and complicates her secrecy, though their dynamic could bear slightly more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s motivation—the need to “navigate the geography of loss” and reconnect with ancestral routes—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Her competence and ritualized actions (hair, censer foot, soldering) make her feel particular rather than generic. However, her interiority stays mostly in a single register of solemn determination, with limited contradictory impulses or moral ambiguity under pressure. The ending shift from uncertainty to certainty is credible but emotionally a bit too smooth for top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is clearly motivated (cultivating psychological safety) and her methods (truffles, the eye, notes in textbooks) align with that in concrete ways, giving her a distinct professional and moral profile. However, we don’t see much genuine internal contradiction or degradation under pressure—her shift from skeptic to “we occlude” feels more like a clarification than a conflicted change. Jorn functions mainly as a plot-delivery device, with limited depth beyond paranoia and fear. The emotional cost of her final decision is only lightly implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s eccentricity and grief come through vividly (the seaweed beard, the locket of someone else’s laughter), and his decision to help is consistent with his history of “carrying what isn’t [his].” The woman has a clear wound and motive, though she borders on a functional mouthpiece for exposition. Internal conflict is implied (his fear/ache around his wife) but not really dramatized in the present tense of the scene. His closing resolve feels earned but emotionally a bit easy given the enormity of what he’s taking on.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s loneliness, professional niche, and buried family history are clearly rendered, and her curiosity plus quiet dissatisfaction credibly drive her into the cavern. The chip-triggered vision with her father nicely externalizes her internal conflict about being “lost” versus “following maps.” However, her final internal shift is a bit tidy and untroubled—there’s little felt resistance or cost in choosing to reinterpret her life. More textured contradiction under pressure (fear vs. desire, skepticism vs. hope) in the cavern sequence would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The queen’s motivation (end the dreams / understand the bleeding starlight) is clear and her fear-versus-disavowal contradiction lands, especially in “I am tired of being a queen who feels nothing” versus the entity’s rebuttal. Interiority is present and embodied enough to feel specific, though it leans on slightly generic abstractions (“weight of crowns, the ache of loneliness, the fear of irrelevance”). Her final decision to descend with new understanding reads as a credible internal turn, even if the cost is more implied than dramatized. The cosmic figure is serviceable as a foil but functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than as a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to save the nexus/city and decode light as language) is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete past failures and present risk; Jorin functions well as a pressure-bearing mirror who brings the ledger and challenges her approach. The internal shift—from forcing control to letting the shell “guide the process”—is earned but a bit tidy, with limited messy contradiction or emotional degradation under stress. Phrases like “resolve was a palette she mixed daily” are evocative but lightly abstract, so interiority leans conceptual more than embodied. The relationship does change state (from solitary striving to “we did it”), though the cost of that shift is mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory—his mix of self-loathing, envy of past selves, and compulsion toward the ritual feels psychologically alive. Micro-choices (following the map despite his limp and distrust of gravity) are well-motivated by the feral nostalgia and chronicler’s curse. The final reorientation from jealousy to acceptance is earned by prior beats, though it tilts slightly toward a tidy insight. Embodied emotion is generally strong, with only occasional abstraction (“I’d never felt so alive and so dead at the same time”) reading more as pose than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is sharply drawn through her anosmia, tactile attention to objects, and quiet, slightly obsessive interpretive habits. Her motivation—to make emotional sense of others’ artifacts while compensating for her own loss—feels consistent and particular. The main weakness is how cleanly she “solves” Mrs. Voss via the photo and engraving; the leap toward certainty (“She’s your miracle”) slightly flattens what could remain a more conflicted, risky inference.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to reframe his scarred failures into power—is clear, embodied, and drives every choice, from attempting a dangerous rune to revisiting childish beliefs. Interiority is specific (ink-stained fingers, itching scars, remembered lessons) and his fear/courage contradiction is dramatized rather than declared. The change at the end (walking “not as a scholar chasing answers, but as a storyteller embracing questions”) is earned by the ritual’s risk and his earlier doubt. The only slight limitation is how cleanly the epiphany lands; the emotional complexity could hold a bit more lingering ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clara is sharply drawn—“gossip-column exorcist” whose “currency” is regret—and Elias’s guilt over his sister gives him a clear, consistent motive. Interiority is present but somewhat light at the emotional peak; we don’t quite feel Clara’s own stakes beyond professional curiosity. The relationship dynamic (her pragmatic metaphoric method vs. his raw regret) is strong and specific. The final choice to “finish the song…Imperfectly” is motivated and credible, if a bit under-embodied emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Witness’s motivation is clear and consistent, but they function more as a symbolic vessel than a fully individuated person. Interiority is abstract (“eyes held the weight of a thousand lifetimes”) rather than embodied, so emotional stakes remain cool. The key realization about spiral arbitration comes smoothly, without much dramatized inner contradiction or visible cost. This keeps the arc coherent but limits depth and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lorn’s interiority is specific and textured—his job, his ritual, the inherited key, and his grandfather’s aphorisms all feel character-particular rather than generic. His motivation (to understand what clocks measure) is clear and drives most of his attention and choices, even if the outer pressure on him is mild. The shift at the end—from thinking of clocks as timekeepers to understanding them as instruments of longing—reads as an earned internal change. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper on-page cost or contradiction (e.g., something he risks or loses) that would render that change more than contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s tension between control and surrender is clear and specific, and his occupation inflects how he approaches the problem. His internal shift at the end is motivated, but the emotional cost feels low and the transition to “I was wrong; surrender is strength” is a bit too smooth. Lira’s role is largely catalytic and enigmatic; her own motives and contradictions remain underdeveloped. Moments like “The system needed permission to change. And I… I needed to understand…” verge on tidy, self-aware articulation rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s contradiction—compulsive gambler raised by a probability professor—feels specific and animates her choices, from riding the Red Line to stepping into the forbidden wing. Her grief over her father and hunger for “contradictions you can hold in your hands” are well dramatized rather than summarized. The final intent to “visit her father” closes a credible emotional loop, though the resolution borders on tidy and low-cost for her core flaw. Ms. Greer functions mainly as a guide rather than a full crucible relationship but still applies relevant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is specific and memorable—a subterranean operator who practices “cultivated estrangement”—and her choices (how she routes each call, how she uses the disc) consistently express that worldview. Emotional texture is present but a bit one-note; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or personal cost beyond a “flicker of purpose.” Secondary characters are sketched efficiently through their calls but remain functional more than pressuring her directly. The final recommitment (“Tomorrow, she’d start again”) feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to maintain the covenant through attention to small human acts—is clear, specific, and consistent, and her connection to her great-grandmother adds emotional depth. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“haunted euphoria,” her fixation on the photo), and her actions (nightly visits, ink rituals, documenting changes) align with that motive. However, internal conflict remains relatively soft; her doubts never force a sharply felt trade-off or mistake, so the final stance feels more like reinforcement than costly change. The endurance choice at the end is believable but not strongly burdened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and Lira both feel specific and non-generic, with concrete hooks (disaster-relief debts, “improbable truths,” rumor-chasing) and a clear, if quiet, shift in Elias at the end (“jocularity no longer a shield but a bridge”). His desperation and debt-sensitivity are well seeded via the geologist and his three days of waiting, but his internal conflict around loneliness itself is only lightly dramatized. The relationship dynamic—her sharp, mischievous certainty versus his skeptical, joking defensiveness—plays well, though it never quite forces a painful choice. The final emotional cost is modest: he comes away somewhat lighter rather than truly changed at a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s grief/hope motivation is clear and particular, and his sensory relationship to the world feels embodied and specific. However, internal conflict is underplayed: he rarely hesitates or errs, so contradictory impulses don’t fully surface under pressure. The final encounter with his mother comes with little on-page struggle in his interiority, which softens the cost of the “before/after.” He’s vivid and memorable, but the arc feels a touch too smooth for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt, professional hubris, and shift from “fixer” to “witness” are clearly motivated and track cleanly through the scene. His occupation and mantra give him specificity, and his final choice to confess and collaborate feels earned. However, his internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly once Lira explains the framework; the struggle between control and surrender could use more on-page friction. Lira is more function than person, though her role as a foil is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is sharply etched—his vocation, temperament, and relationship to silence all cohere, and his actions consistently express his stated motive of “translating silence into music.” Lira has enough specificity (skepticism shading into collaboration) to feel like more than a prop, though she remains less deep. What’s missing at this tier is a live internal contradiction in Kael under pressure; he never truly wavers or pays a psychologically difficult price for what he does. The sadness at dawn is affecting but lightly sketched, more wistful than revealing of a deeper flaw or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation—honoring her grandmother and “rescuing” living knowledge—is vivid and coherent, and her actions (obsidian ink, symbolic vandalism, following Elara’s trail) align strongly with it. The emotional throughline of fierce caretaking disguised as destruction is specific and embodied (fire, ink, char, tears). What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or risk: she rarely doubts, fears, or wrestles with competing impulses on the page. The closing identity shift from arsonist/thief to gardener is earned, but feels more gently affirmed than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motivation—to understand the lagoon-linked sorrow and reject passive treatment—is clear and consistent, and his rebelliousness is embodied in the drumming rather than just labeled. His emotional arc from haunted to hopeful is earned enough by the progression through memory, contact with the woman, and the final drumming. Internal contradiction (resenting the experiments yet needing what they gave him) is present but not fully dramatized in live, pressured decisions. The woman feels more like a thematic catalyst than a fully pressured character, which slightly flattens relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motives (double pay as pretext, real desire to validate his theory and relationship to the labyrinth) are clear and consistent, and his competence in the maze reads convincingly. However, internal contradiction is relatively light; his fear vs curiosity and map-dependence vs instinct are gestured at but never sharply dramatized as simultaneous pulls in key moments. The emotional cost of his choices (e.g., embracing whispers/solitude over camaraderie) is only faintly implied. Voss and the haulers function more as pressure backdrop than as relational crucibles that force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is distinct and coherent—her quiet vigilance, relationship to the mirror, and ritual with the shutters all feel character-specific and earned. Motivation (“to teach darkness the value of stars”) is clear and enacted, not just told. However, she is more emblematic than fully conflicted; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal struggle on the page. The final refusal to speak to the fisherman hints at an Earned Stasis, but the cost of that choice is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara and Lila are both clearly motivated—Clara’s grief-channeled mentorship and Lila’s need to know “how to win”—and their dynamic evolves credibly over the night. Lila’s interior shift from *I’m alone* to *I’m learning* is simple but earned, and the father connection gives their bond weight. However, Clara’s own contradictions and unresolved grief are only lightly sketched; we don’t see her pushed into a genuinely difficult choice. The relationship changes state, but with relatively low visible cost for either character.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to escape a crumbling, violent home and pursue a deeper freedom—is clear and consistent, and her emotional texture is grounded in concrete objects (the scrimshaw, the island). However, her internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly once the whale appears; contradictory impulses (fear vs longing, loyalty vs self-preservation) never truly grind against each other on the page. The final epiphany about her father and the island as a “mirror” feels somewhat pre-packaged rather than wrestled toward under duress. Still, the decisive renunciation of the scrimshaw does register as a real, character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation—to preserve grief through quiet, deniable acts of creation—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in how she handles the bouquet and the spoon. Her history with her parents grounds her present choices and paints a credible, wounded competence. What’s missing at this level is sharper on-page contradiction: she rarely feels truly torn between compliance and rebellion, so her “performance” under the mandate reads more resolved than internally fraught. The endurance/renunciation at the end is earned, but the emotional struggle leading there could be more dynamically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s motivation (ending isolation, dissolving sacred/profane boundaries through art) is clear and consistent, and her perception of the world feels particular to a “cloud-shadow poet.” However, there’s almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle—her desire meets no real resistance, so we don’t see her make a costly or conflicted choice. The closing certainty that she’s “shaping” the world arrives without much emotional friction or doubt on the page. This keeps the characterization from reaching a more complex, elite-level interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched—a colorblind painter obsessed with beauty in imperfection whose vow against pigment makes his choice to use the cobalt dust carry real, if underplayed, cost. His interiority is specific (seeing “vibrancy where others saw void”), and his micro-choices track cleanly from curiosity to complicity. Marla’s mix of ruthlessness and belief in “imperfection as fuel” reads vivid and particular. The main weakness is how quickly Elias absorbs the revelation of Marla’s role in the phoenix fire; the emotional and relational fallout feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and particular—“to discover the texture of connection”—and her curiosity-driven temperament is consistently dramatized in how she experiments and goes into the cave. However, internal conflict is muted: she hesitates only briefly before leaving the lab, and her “powerfully gentle” trait doesn’t generate visible trade-offs or mistakes. Dr. Voss functions mainly as a framing presence rather than a true relational crucible. The final shift—her commitment to “keep questioning”—feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s grief, guilt, and atonement motive are vivid and specific, and his occupation is meaningfully tied to how he copes. However, he rarely experiences genuinely conflicting impulses on the page; once his ritual is set, he mostly enacts it without inner friction. Emotional states are often summarized rather than dramatized in embodied beats under pressure. The final shift toward “quiet, burning certainty” feels earned but somewhat easy because we don’t see him risk or renounce much in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s characterization is vivid and specific—ex-analyst turned cartomancer, child who dismantled clocks—but her interior conflict is mild, with few contradictory impulses under real pressure. Mara functions well as a foil and learner, but her emotional range is narrow and her rapid buy-in feels easy. The relationship dynamic is clear (mentor–seeker), yet it doesn’t quite become a crucible that forces a hard choice. The final stance (“This is how we rebuild.”) is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lirael’s motivation—to confront forbidden knowledge while rejecting “patterns”—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and her embodied responses to the pagoda’s hum and light feel particular rather than generic. The relationship with Kael functions as a crucible that tests her stance and reveals status dynamics (her risk-embracing defiance vs. his fear and orthodoxy). However, her internal conflict is relatively muted; she rarely seems genuinely tempted to retreat, so the final embrace of the unknown feels more confirmation than hard-won reversal. The cost to her relationship with Kael is implied but not lingered on enough to deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s curiosity and “softly deliberate” nature clearly motivate her choice to research quietly rather than alert the council, and her final act of speaking “Bloom” feels earned. However, internal conflict is relatively light: we’re told she hesitates, but we don’t feel a deep tug-of-war between fear, duty, and hope. Thalos functions well as a regretful mentor but mostly as an exposition mouthpiece, with limited pressure on Lirael. The emotional shift at the end (tears, relief) is plausible but somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s interiority is specific and grounded in action—the way she handles the tail and tools tracks cleanly with her gentleness and shaken ethics, and her micro-choices (fleeing, staying soft, methodically reconstructing) all align with her core conflict. Her contradictory impulses—wanting to remain compassionate yet fearing exploitation—are credible and present throughout, not just named once. The final shift (reframing compassion as strength) is earned by the preceding work with the tail, though the transition is quite smooth and low-friction rather than agonized, which slightly softens perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s grief, physical scar, and need for closure are cleanly motivated, and her choice to keep following increasingly painful rings underlines an internal arc that credibly culminates in her re-reading of her scar. Interiority is concrete and mostly particular (“mind accidentally telepathic with the ivy,” the scar as “a map”), though it occasionally drifts toward generalization. The final shift from pain to “connection” is a bit swift and tidy, but it’s at least prepared by the mother’s earlier “stories are written in scars” line.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motives (to locate “unused love” and decode her grandmother’s legacy) are clear, and her emotional responses to the film and letters feel grounded and embodied (“throat tightened,” trembling, the ache in her chest). The psychometry visions give her interiority a concrete vehicle instead of pure summary. However, we get limited contradictory impulse or real micro-dilemma—she never seriously considers walking away, and the final decision to devote herself to the theater’s secrets comes without visible cost or resistance. Elise and Thomas live mostly as backstory rather than on-page relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s yearning for lost skies and unspoken creativity is specific and embodied (“mind hummed with half-formed symphonies and paintings that dissolved like mist”), and his actions—using the sextant, entering the chamber, taking the jar—align cleanly with that motive. The interiority is vivid but relatively low on contradiction: he rarely seems genuinely torn, just blocked then released. His final state (buzzing with ideas, choosing to chase the aurora again) is an earned reconfiguration of the opening frustration, though the cost of this shift is only lightly sketched (momentary overwhelm, collapse to his knees). Overall, he reads as a particular person rather than a type, but with room for more friction and blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael is cleanly motivated (duty, curiosity, then commitment to “cultivate the sparks”) and his final choice to fix the clock and embrace dreaming grows plausibly from what we’ve seen. His dreamlessness and late-blooming ache give him particularity, and small concrete details (freight guard, crates of seeds and maps) help. However, internal contradiction and real struggle are underplayed: he moves from guard to quasi-mystic with minimal resistance or fear. The transformation feels more accepted than fought through, which trims depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interior lens are clear and specific—her desire to “rediscover the wild frontier of her mind” coherently drives every choice. The heirloom gear usefully externalizes her attachment to her father and to a mechanized understanding of self. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: she moves through awe and revelation with almost no real hesitation or emotional turbulence, so the injunction to “let go” lands more as a smooth pivot than a costly fracture. A touch more contradiction or reluctance in the letting-go moment would elevate the character work significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira and Jorin are cleanly, if archetypically, drawn, with a clear mentor–apprentice dynamic and distinct speech patterns. Jorin’s arc from fretful uncertainty to an earned, quieter confidence lands, especially in the “What now?” / “we wait for the next leash to break” exchange. However, their inner conflicts are sketched more than pressure-tested—doubt and faith never truly collide on the page. The closure choice to keep vigil reads motivated but relatively low-cost and low-ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elric’s role, habits, and quiet sense of duty are sharply sketched, and his conflict between being “unseen” and breaking silence is conceptually strong, especially around Lady Veyra’s outburst. However, his key realization at the staircase (“the stain was…a map”) reads more allegorical than psychologically earned, making the leap from observation to fully articulated philosophy feel slightly imposed. Emotional states are often summarized rather than embodied, so his fear, shame, or relief under pressure never cut as deeply as they could. The final transformation into “keeper of hope” is coherent but a bit tidy and cost-light.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Veyra’s core motivation and competence are clear, and her long preparation through ancestral messages hints at depth, but she faces almost no real resistance on the page. Interiority is mostly functional—she recalls clues and interprets them—but we rarely feel contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Her final declaration of heirship lands more as fulfillment of a given destiny than as the outcome of a contested inner struggle. Secondary figures remain flat, serving as crowd reaction rather than real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s obsession, loneliness, and stubborn curiosity are well sketched, and her biologist lens colors what she notices. Her motivation to understand the disappearing paths is clear and consistent, and Kael functions credibly as both skeptic and eventual ally, though he remains thinner. Internal contradiction (duty to the station vs urge to follow the path; grief vs wonder) is present but underdeveloped on the page. The decision to abandon the station is motivated but its emotional and practical cost could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s characterization is vivid—barefoot, pattern-obsessed, dismissed as “mad”—and her motivation to restore meaning and momentum to the rebellion clearly drives her choices. Jax works well as a skeptical foil whose shift into ally status is earned by prior history (“He’d seen Lira’s predictions come true before”). However, her “awkwardly confident” trait is told more than shown, and we see little genuine internal contradiction or cost to her clarity. The closing beat, where she steps smoothly into a quasi-leader role, feels a touch too easy for someone framed as a camp joke.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nana Marisol is vivid, specific, and grounded in a clear history; her motives (care for her people, suspicion of control, desire to evolve tradition) convincingly shape her actions. Her insurgent past and plant-telepathy both inform present choices rather than feeling ornamental. The main weakness is a relative lack of on-page hesitation or contradiction when faced with an obviously consequential relic; she moves to planting with little visible struggle. A slightly deeper, messier internal conflict at the peak choice would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lila’s trauma, coping attempts, and small but decisive shift at the end are well-motivated and particular, with embodied details like the trembling vs. steady hands and the lavender in her pocket. The internal conflict between being pulled back into the bombing and choosing to ground herself lands credibly. Mrs. Voss is a bit more of a gentle mentor archetype, sometimes slipping into didactic exposition, but she still functions as a clear relational crucible without flattening Lila. The final choice—to look at the photograph without freezing and to walk home with a new stance—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (smudged glasses, ribs aching, tactile threads) and his actions—collecting threads, tearing the Hanged Man, ascending/descending—track cleanly with his frustration and longing for meaning. The shift from contempt for tarot/fate to active reweaving is a credible internal change. However, his conflict remains mostly one-directional melancholy rather than richly contradictory (very little push-pull between despair and hope in-scene). Relationships are absent, so his arc never faces interpersonal pressure that might complicate or deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s core motivation (her brother’s erasure and the time anomaly) is vivid and drives every choice, and her “serene anger” gives her a distinct emotional coloring. We see her make specific, goal-driven decisions—using the ink in an unorthodox way, interrogating the child, choosing to leave. Internal contradiction is hinted (anger vs serenity) but never really dramatized in-scene under pressure, so her arc feels more linear than transformative. Relationships (elders, child, brother) are evocative but don’t quite become crucibles that force a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lirael’s duty-versus-conscience conflict is clear and motivates her choice to wake Kael, but it’s told in somewhat generic terms (“bravely conflicted heart”) rather than made sharply particular through idiosyncratic thought or behavior. Her fear, values, and professional identity as archivist do shape the decision, which keeps the arc coherent. Kael, however, is thinly sketched and functions mostly as a symbolic receptacle for “the truth” rather than as a pressure-bearing character. The final pact between them feels emotionally under-earned because his characterization never deepens beyond instant understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira is clear, specific, and consistent: a pacifist heir to a violent legacy whose choices (repurposing the knife, burying the scrap) arise naturally from her values. Emotional texture is present but mostly harmonious—there’s little on-page contradiction or irrationality under pressure. Her relationship with the absent father is well-sketched but never really becomes a crucible because he’s not on the page to oppose her. The closing stance feels earned, though the internal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly for the piece’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation and temperament are clear—cool-headed, ritual-competent, both scientist and supplicant—and his actions track cleanly with his goal of catching the goddess’s echo. Interiority is present but not especially layered; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond composure versus threatened “unravel[ing] his composure.” His grief and awe are more labeled than deeply embodied, which keeps the emotional arc slightly at arm’s length. The final acceptance of the goddess’s dissolution feels earned but not profoundly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motivation and inner conflict—loyalty to family versus devotion to truth—are specific and consistent, and her choice to expose the archives feels earned by the earlier beats (“Pay off the inspector. Don’t let Clara see this.”). The physical interaction with the nib nicely externalizes her shifting resolve. Emotional progression is believable, though occasionally shaded toward neat, articulate realizations rather than messier contradiction under stress. Secondary characters are thin but function adequately as pressure rather than people, which is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motives are clear and particular—her history with silenced emotion makes the firmware’s baby-cry erasure viscerally personal, and her choice to confront the code feels earned. The moment where “the words spill out before she could stop them” nicely reveals a pressured, slightly out-of-control impulse. Internal contradiction is hinted (she tattoos stars to escape her past but walks into it here) but not deeply dramatized in-scene. Elara functions mostly as an expositional guide rather than a full crucible relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is sharply sketched—whimsical, perceptive, drawn to patterns—and her mantra about unlearning gives her a particular worldview. Her core conflict (protecting the hush vs. obeying the tile’s call to “interject”) is clear and resolved through action, not summary. However, her emotional life stays relatively tidy and idealized; we don’t see much genuine mess, contradiction, or cost beyond a generalized “unease.” A slightly rougher, more self-compromising interiority would deepen her and make the final resolve feel less frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is distinct and motivated—his “aberrant mercy” creed, retrocognitive visions, and quiet rituals all feel specific and coherent. However, his internal conflict remains largely conceptual; we’re told about paradox and loss more than we see him pulled between genuinely competing impulses in the moment. The key choice (placing the tessera and walking away) feels emotionally appropriate but low-cost and relatively unpressured, so the arc lands as evolution of stance rather than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motive—to feel the crowd’s energy again and to mend the fractured timelines—is clear and consistent, and his actions track logically from it. However, his emotional life remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic rather than embodied under pressure; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a real cost to his choices beyond a graceful fade at dawn. The flapper woman and other echoes function more as atmospheric presences than as characters exerting pressure on him. Strong, distinctive premise-character, but not yet at the depth or complexity expected for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is well realized as an “affectionate skeptic,” with a coherent blend of distrust toward the pills and tenderness toward the geode and his own body’s signals. His interiority is concrete (tingling wrist, breadcrumbs of sensation) and his change—from experimenting uncertainly to claiming “This is real” and wanting to show the world—feels earned. Mara is sketched efficiently as hopeful yet wary, and their dynamic adds pressure without melodrama. The main limitation is that his internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in a hard choice with visible on-page cost.

    Lira’s vocation, sensibility, and evolving sense of purpose are clear and particular, and her actions track cleanly with her motives (activating the mapper, touching the fossil, deciding to “awaken the world’s memory”). However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction—her epiphany mostly confirms what she already wants—so the arc reads more as deepening than as a pressured change with cost. Some emotional beats lean on generic phrasing (“Her pulse quickened,” “chest tight with resolve”), which slightly flattens her individuality at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation (reshape prophecy) is clear and consistent, and her contemplative, methodical nature comes through in the button-sorting sequence. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal—her “library of half-remembered tales” is a nice, character-particular lens. However, internal conflict is minimal and her final stance feels like an extension of what we’re told she already believes, rather than a costly or contradictory shift. The piece would benefit from one sharper tension between impatience vs. reverence, fear vs. curiosity, to give her arc more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s internal life is rich and specific—the burned spy who can “read the silence between heartbeats” feels lived-in, and her mix of paranoia and longing is consistent. Her motivation (to honor and decode her father’s final message, to repair her courage) is clear and tied to concrete micro-choices: coming to the bluff, kneeling to write, deciding to go on to the weather station. The tension between fear of trusting others and the need to act is present, though it resolves a bit neatly into insight rather than showing a messier, costlier conflict on the page. The final shift—accepting that courage is a flame to be rekindled—feels earned but somewhat thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thaddeus is clearly sketched—a ritual-bound, hyper-observant coachman whose gift is “to distill complexity into essence”—and his history with the river and ferryman feels lived-in. However, his inner life lacks contradiction or genuine pressure; he mostly affirms what he already believes. The ferryman is an effective but minimal presence, exerting no active pressure on Thaddeus’s choices. The final stance (“carry his own layer forward”) is more a restatement than a hard-earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s curiosity and contemplative temperament are clearly established, and her motivation—understanding why the oasis resists entropy—is consistent throughout. Her choices (using the lantern, reading the sun, leaving once she understands) arise logically from who she is. However, she experiences little on-page internal contradiction or strain; she’s almost preternaturally serene, which limits depth at key beats. The final shift is more an intellectual realization than a hard-won, costly change in self.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vividly drawn—a man whose vocation for coaxing life from inhospitable spaces maps cleanly onto his emotional project with Mara—and his actions align with his stated motive. However, his inner conflict is underplayed: we see resolve more than contradictory impulses or genuine fear of rejection. Mara, while affecting, is closer to a familiar type (the dim widow in a shuttered shop) than a fully individuated presence. The final micro-shift (her letting him in and opening the window) feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation (“translate isolation into independence”) is clear and consistently supported by her actions, especially the choice to write for herself. Her interiority is specific enough to feel individual, though largely conveyed in summary rather than through sharply dramatized, contradictory impulses. The moment she whispers “I see you. But I am not you.” is a strong, character-specific crystallization. What’s missing at this tier is more friction—she doesn’t visibly struggle against an opposing impulse before choosing independence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s vocation, hollowed-out empathy, and fear of disconnection are clearly rendered and embodied in specific memories (grandmother’s baskets) and in her trembling over the secret slip. Her internal conflict—professional skill at articulating others’ feelings vs. inability to connect herself—is sharp but resolves a bit too cleanly and quickly. Elara is vivid as a presence but functions mainly as a thematic mouthpiece/guide rather than a full character under pressure. The final shift (choosing vulnerability and resolving to change how she works) is motivated but carries limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila’s competence, doubt, and stubbornness come through clearly—her admission, “No… But doing nothing guarantees failure,” is a strong character-defining moment. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she moves from perception to plan to execution without much contradictory impulse or moral tangle. Hale provides a light but effective relational pressure, though their dynamic doesn’t significantly evolve. The ending stance (taping up the mocking chart, preparing for the next round) is credible but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation (get the key despite claustrophobia) is clear and consistent, and we do see his fear and drive in tension (“Prudently adventurous, he’d prepared for traps and ghosts, but nothing had prepared him for the weight of silence.”). His micro-choices—whether to stay or leap, whether to jab the compass into the wall—track with his traits. However, the interiority leans on labels (“claustrophobia clawed at his ribs”) rather than deeply particularized thought, and his final stance shift feels more asserted than excavated. Relationships are absent, which is fine for scope but limits character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara is vivid and specific—face-blind, hyper-attentive to texture, driven by a need to “map” chaos—which grounds her methods and choices. Her empathy-versus-procedure stance is clear and consistent, though internal contradiction is relatively mild; she rarely feels truly torn. Voss functions credibly as skeptic and procedural counterweight, but stays somewhat one-note. The emotional turn when Clara finally “sees” Lila via the locket lands, but it moves almost too quickly into a neat insight.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s mix of archival competence, idealism, and inherited shame reads specific and credible, and her choices (digging, defying the director, going to the roof) track cleanly with her motives. The ancestor relationship provides a clear emotional engine. Internal contradiction—wanting safety/normalcy vs risking herself to vindicate her great-grandmother—is present but only lightly textured. I’d like one sharper moment of irrationality or self-deception under stress to deepen her beyond a well-executed type.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias has a clear vocation and worldview (bridge-song tradition, belief in music’s power) and his curiosity about Marisol and the flake motivates each step. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: he moves from puzzlement to acceptance of the magic with little resistance or contradictory impulse. The final “choice” is framed but not sufficiently pressured on the page, so the felt cost of his readiness to play again is muted. Marisol, though intriguing, functions more as expositional catalyst than as a full relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s backstory as a highway robber’s son and his conflict with his father’s fatalism create a credible, specific psychology. His choices with the foreign bills align with his values (nonviolent, symbolic pressure) and show a coherent moral stance. The internal shift—reframing his father’s lessons as a guide rather than a curse—is earned, though the peace at the end feels slightly tidy. Emotional embodiment could be richer under stress, but his motives are always legible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s vocation, exile, and fear of being drowned by others’ pain create a specific, credible inner life, and her choice to surrender detachment and step into the hologram is motivated by her brother and Veyra’s plea. The embodied beats (fogging glass, pen over blank page, throat tightening) keep emotion grounded. However, the internal contradiction—her long avoidance of others’ burdens vs. sudden readiness to carry them—could be dramatized with a bit more in-the-moment friction before she agrees. Veyra works well as a pressure source but remains mostly functional rather than deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is distinct and grounded—a guarded druid with a strong sensory presence and a believable mix of dread and compulsion. Her motivation (to uncover what she’s buried about herself) clearly drives her entry into the vortex and the choice to release the seed. The internal conflict between her self-image as a force for good and the revealed capacity for violence is well-drawn, though the emotional resolution comes a bit too cleanly. A touch more irrationality or lingering self-division at the end would deepen the cost of her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motivation (mend the eclipsed covenant / find the intersection of dreams) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and her scar-history gives her some particularity. The internal conflict between fear of losing her humanity and duty to repair the covenant is present but resolved quickly, with limited messy contradiction on the page. The golden-eyed double provides a mirror and some pressure but feels more like a thematic mouthpiece than a fully embodied rival self. The final acceptance choice is motivated and legible, but the emotional price is more stated than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s motivation—to atone for a specific past failure and “patch the holes in [her] soul”—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives every choice. The boy in the river and the burned Fool card give her guilt concrete weight, and her shift from aggressive certainty to wanting to be “gentle” feels earned. Internal conflict between her reckless drive and her new desire for care is present, though it could be sharpened with more in-the-moment hesitation or temptation to repeat old patterns. The keeper is thin but functional as a crucible figure whose offers and comments pressure her core flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lenny’s interiority is vivid and specific—the failed-roadie-turned-appraiser haunted by one public mistake and a whole lost life feels credible and grounded. His defensive use of “facts,” his shame about the TV segment, and his almost-reflexive dismissal of the cloth to Gus all align into a coherent, flawed psychology. The internal conflict between tossing the cloth as “worthless” and treating it as a personal relic is clear, though it could sharpen under more explicit cost or risk. The final shift toward embracing the cloth and his role as a “resurrector of forgotten stories” is motivated and earned, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (“kindly methodical,” analogical thinker) are clear and consistent, and her actions track those traits well. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual rather than generic. However, she encounters little real resistance or internal contradiction; her success comes relatively smoothly, so change and cost are muted. The arc feels more like deepened understanding than a pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Characters are clear, particular, and motivated—especially the librarian as a ritualized facilitator and the woman as someone both craving and fearing transformation—but interiority remains mostly implied rather than deeply dramatized. The woman's fear of losing herself is credible yet resolved very quickly once the creel is offered. Relationship dynamics (mentor/seeker, then librarian/child) are legible and functional but not pushed into real moral or emotional friction. The librarian’s own shifting identity is mentioned but not deeply felt as an internal contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is sketched with an intriguing professional specificity and a suggestive past (Lira, the pearl), and his shift from inspector to conduit is legible. However, his interior conflict is underdeveloped: he experiences realization more than struggle, and the “heartbeat of a hesitation” isn’t dramatized as a real, value-costing dilemma. Emotions skew abstract (“connection,” “abandoned hopes”) rather than deeply embodied or idiosyncratic. The final transformation feels a touch too frictionless for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid, particular, and coherently rooted in her history with rivers, meds, and guilt; her choice to come off meds and to be “methodical” about graffiti/mapping feels specific rather than generic. The internal conflict—control vs. surrender, mapping vs. flowing—plays out credibly in how she treats the graffiti and the river. Her final shift to drawing a map of her heart and accepting a meandering path reads earned, though the cost of that shift (what she’s truly giving up) could be sharpened. Occasional phrasing edges towards therapy-speak abstraction (“terrain of self-forgiveness”), slightly smoothing over messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s goal and surface emotions are clear and consistent, and the watch/journal habits give her a concrete, particular way of thinking. However, she encounters little real resistance, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or values under pressure. There’s no visible cost or renunciation at the end, which keeps her arc from feeling fully earned at a literary-mag level.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s interiority is specific and textured: her provenance work, accidental telepathy, and conflicted attraction to power make her feel particular rather than archetypal. The push-pull between empire and garden is dramatized in concrete micro-choices (touching the violin, consulting the coffee, summoning the plants). Her renunciation at the end (dismantling the dream) is earned by prior dread of “perforated destiny” and the mulberry ache. The main limitation is that no on-page relationship pressure exists to complicate her further, keeping the arc slightly more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation and professional identity are clear and specific, and her micro-choices under pressure (how to handle the chip, when to risk embellishing) track cleanly with that. What’s missing for a higher band is sharper internal contradiction or a more visible flaw—she rarely feels genuinely at risk of failing through her own limits rather than circumstance. Emotional embodiment is present but leans more on atmosphere than on idiosyncratic, character-particular reactions. The ending shows an earned endurance rather than a deep internal shift, which fits but keeps the arc modest.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael is vividly grounded—a caretaker whose mix of duty, hurt, and wary hope feels specific, and her forgiveness history with Elara gives her current choices weight. The fragile trust (“like the shell in her hand”) nicely externalizes inner conflict. However, her struggle in the present scene resolves a bit too smoothly; we don’t see much real temptation to withhold trust now. Elara is sketched convincingly but simply, with little on-page pressure pushing back against Lirael’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s role as a “conscience for hire” and his ambivalence about his own tools make him distinctive, and Mira’s grief is credible if somewhat archetypal. His internal experience in the cloak—“terrifying. And exhilarating.”—nicely captures contradictory impulses. However, his emotional cost remains muted; we don’t really feel what this particular job risks for him beyond a faint exposure in the touch on his sleeve. The relationship dynamic is strong but could use one more specific, pressured choice to fully earn his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara and Lira both have clear, distinct motives—testing the theory vs. needing to understand—and their dynamic is legible and consistent. Elara’s backward aging adds texture but doesn’t significantly complicate her choices on the page. Emotional life is more implied through image and stance than deeply embodied, so interior conflict stays relatively abstract. The final shift, with Lira’s first glimmer of insight, feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand the pulse and “navigate without moving”—is clear and consistent, and his long apprenticeship gives him some texture. However, internal conflict is muted; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt undercutting his reverence. The epiphany about alignment over chasing comes quickly and lands a bit as received wisdom rather than the culmination of on-page struggle. His emotions are more often summarized than embodied, which flattens the cost of his final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s dissatisfaction and underachievement are clearly motivated by the shift to automated magic and his longing for “the sacred in the simple.” His choices (stealing the starlight, using the keystone, choosing his mother’s garden) are all legible and aligned with that drive. However, his interior conflict is relatively tidy: there’s little sense of simultaneous contradictory impulses or genuine risk in letting go of grandiose magic ideals. The emotional turn at the fountain and with the sketch feels somewhat pre-packaged rather than wrestled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief, superstition around “13,” and fixation on the “color of sound” create a specific, textured interiority, and his final act of leaving the key reads as an earned internal shift rather than a flip. Motivation (to answer the ship’s call and understand Lila’s last words) is clear and consistent with his lamplighter identity and long avoidance. The main limitation is that his contradictions under pressure are mostly summarized as past behavior (“hidden behind truth”) rather than dramatized in a present-tense waver or near-refusal in the library.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael is distinct—a curious, duty-bound “cast lots decision maker”—and his interiority is textured enough to feel individual. However, his doubt never really bites; the shift from skepticism to conviction comes smoothly, without much on-page resistance or contradictory impulse. His emotional responses are largely labeled (“quietly enthusiastic determination,” “the doubt…began to shed”) rather than embodied through specific, pressured micro-choices. The final acceptance feels conceptually earned but emotionally under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief over Lira and his fallen status as a reaper give him clear, compelling motivation, and his choice to proceed despite the echoes’ warning (“Do not name them…”) reads as an earned, character-specific risk. Interiority is concrete and mostly embodied (“his hands trembled”), not just labeled. There is some genuine internal contradiction—guilt and fear coexisting with a drive toward remembrance—but it could sharpen further at the peak. The final shift from broken to “distant intimacy” with fear and souls feels credible and causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s brittle faith, repeated failures, and stubborn optimism feel specific and coherent with his actions, and Marla’s skepticism provides a clear relational crucible. His motivation to fix the bell and the rift is well rooted in his naivete and insecurity. However, his internal conflict (doubt vs. hope) is more implied than really pressured on the page; we don’t see him genuinely waver in real time. The final “madness/devotion” line is strong but edges toward articulating what the story has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s vigilance, grief, and sense of duty are well-realized through concrete behavior (patrolling the dam, hoarding and “expunging” photographs). Her internal turn—from solitary guardian of infrastructure to guardian of communal memory—is clear and earned by prior traits. The relationship to Elias (via his daughter) credibly reframes her motives. A bit of Elias’s psychology is delivered as neat explanation rather than dramatized tension, slightly flattening nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s inner split between her father’s rationalism and her mother’s mysticism is clear and specific, and her decision to plunge her hand into the flame embodies that conflict with real cost. Her perceptions are well-embodied in the environment, and her competence feels earned rather than hand-waved. The internal change—accepting paradox rather than choosing a side—tracks logically from prior beats. The main limitation is that the epiphany comes a touch too smoothly, with little visible resistance or lingering contradiction at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s role and motivation are clear and consistent—he’s the inheritor of a technical, quasi-mystical duty and wants to protect the arbor and honor his mother. Interiority is generally concrete and embodied (hands on bark, sweat, breath fogging the hologram), though his emotional life under pressure stays relatively simple and competent. There’s limited contradictory impulse or real temptation to fail or walk away, so the final “reframing” of the burden costs him little. The relationship with the mother is affecting but largely idealized, with no sharp edges or unresolved resentment to complicate him.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation (resisting replacement and defeating numbness) is clear and consistent, and his prior ego death coherently informs his current risk tolerance. Interiority is present but often summarized in abstract terms (“emotional numbness,” “ego death”) rather than pushed into specific, contradictory impulses in the moment. The clone is thinly characterized—a functional antagonist with generic “cold” traits and little nuance. The final integration choice is motivated but could carry more felt ambiguity or loss to reach a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is specific, competent, and plausibly motivated by curiosity and a designer’s mindset, and his occupational details (escape room proprietor with a security past) feel lived-in. However, his internal life under pressure is relatively smooth—there’s little contradiction, fear, or genuine risk of being wrong, so his “shift” at the end feels more like affirmation than costly change. Emotions stay mostly at an intellectual register even at key beats (the plant disappearing, the key’s discovery). This keeps the characterization solid but short of deeply compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marlowe’s desire to restore lost laughter is clear, particular, and embodied through his ritual with the leaf blower and the toll on his body. His sensitivity to “the unspoken” feels like a real, defining quirk rather than a label. What’s missing for a higher score is genuine internal contradiction—he never wavers or shows mixed impulses, so his emotional range under pressure stays relatively narrow. The final acceptance of the cost is earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (homesickness, oath, suspicion of “light”/finality) is clear and her final choice feels earned by prior interiority, with embodied emotion in details like claws in ice and the pendant burning her thigh. Her contradiction—guardian of reality who longs to leave it—plays credibly in scene. The cultist is thinly sketched but functions as a focused pressure rather than a person, which slightly flattens the relational crucible at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and particular—his “stoically sensitive” burden, guilt over Veyra, and fixation on the crozier all feel specific rather than generic. His final choice to pour his essence into the relic is clearly motivated by that mix of self-loathing and need to “interrupt” destiny, with visible cost. The piece does, however, edge into slightly expository self-diagnosis (“This wasn’t about the crozier. It was about him.”), softening the sense of contradiction playing out on the page. A bit more dramatized ambivalence in the final decision, less stated realization, would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and his technical actions (adjusting dials, dismantling machinery) do map to his goal. However, he reads more as an archetypal mystic-technician than as an individuated person; we get almost no contradictory impulses or embodied emotional reaction under pressure. The mantra “Discard assumptions” gestures toward an inner struggle that never fully sharpens into on-page conflict. His epiphany about beginnings and endings arrives quickly and cleanly, with little sense of cost or resistance inside him.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motives and temperament are clear and consistent—his optimism, sense of duty, and dawning fear all track cleanly, especially when his “resiliently positive grin faltered.” The inner conflict around merging timelines vs. risking unraveling reality is present but relatively brief and could carry more contradiction and cost. His attachment to the passengers is sketched (“he’d memorized their stories”) rather than dramatized in a way that would sharpen his choice. Overall he feels particular, but his arc could use one more beat of real hesitation or self-interest to feel fully earned at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motivation—to test “rational enchantment” and discover the “texture of connection”—is clear and consistently drives her actions, and her skeptical-yet-yearning mindset feels specific rather than generic. We see some embodied reaction (breath quickening, sense of sanity strain), but the internal conflict never becomes sharply contradictory under pressure. The “fever dream architect” identity is more label than dramatized flaw or skill. Her final calm feels earned enough, but the cost of getting there is underplayed, softening the arc’s sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s motivations (adrift yet responsible, wanting grounding and expansion) are clear and consistent, and the chain link nicely externalizes her inner conflict. However, her struggle never sharpens into a true dilemma; contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized in action. The students, including Tarel, function mainly as prompts rather than pressure sources. The final sense of purpose feels earned but low-cost, more gentle clarification than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s role, methods, and emotional tenor are clear and consistent, and her gentleness plus workmanlike competence feel particular rather than generic. However, she experiences almost no real internal conflict or doubt—her “persistently curious” trait never forces a painful trade-off—and her emotional cost is limited to mild throat-tightening. The widow is sketched efficiently but remains archetypal. The final reassurance lands, but without a sense that Lila had to struggle against herself or her limits to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s fear of tight spaces versus her obsessive need to uncover the truth about her brother is clear and drives concrete choices, especially in the descent and activation beats. Her grief is particularized through images (the single bubble, the gold fleck) rather than labels. However, her emotional progression through the climax could use one more contradictory impulse or irrational choice under pressure to feel truly layered. As is, she’s compelling and coherent but not yet at the most complex literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s obsession with heartbeats, the shard, and the error gives him a clear, specific psychology and a coherent motive that carries through to his final stance. His internal contradiction—wanting to erase the error yet needing it as proof—is dramatized rather than just stated. The AI relationship is thin but functional as a pressure source. The emotional shift at the end (reframing the ghost as compass) feels earned if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storyteller’s core motivation (translating texture into sound) is vivid and consistent, and her fear of oblivion credibly surfaces under pressure at the climax. Her choices (waiting for the flock, conducting the experiment, then discarding the diamond) clearly arise from that motivation. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a more dramatized clash of impulses in the final beats—she recognizes the curse’s nature and rejects it almost without visible hesitation. The “I am the extinction” line risks feeling like a declared realization rather than one earned through a textured internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s professional drive, grief for her mentor, and fear of irrelevance create a credible mix of motives, and her internal tug-of-war during metamorphosis is clear and embodied (“her hands clawed, her back arched like a bow”). The choice to revert to human yet abandon the researcher role feels earned by the prior tension between duty and the seduction of “lightness.” The herbalist is more archetypal than particular but still functions as a sharp, pressuring counterpart. A slightly deeper, more specific articulation of what Elara is sacrificing at the end would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, specific, and present in her every action, and the use of the locust shell as something she learned from over years gives her a lived-in history. Her emotions are mostly embodied through musical effort (trembling hands, bleeding fingers) rather than labels. The main limitation is that she’s almost entirely pure and aligned with her goal; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or flawed self-deception under pressure. Her final understanding feels earned but could be deepened by more visible internal conflict earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias feels specific—a rule-following rebel who believes in connection at the edges of war—and his mailman role is cleanly integrated with his worldview. His decision to send the bottle is motivated and aligned with that character. However, internal conflict is muted: he doesn’t visibly wrestle with fear, guilt, or competing loyalties, so the emotional cost of his choice remains low. The final shift toward hope lands, but more as an articulated insight than a fully dramatized inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elio’s core motivation—seeking beauty and possibility in silence—is clear and consistently expressed through his actions (searching for the halo fragment, following the bells, choosing to sing). However, there is little internal contradiction or genuine struggle; he encounters almost no resistance, so his realization at the end feels like an extension rather than a costly shift. His emotions are mostly implied via atmosphere rather than embodied conflict. The arc lands as gentle refinement rather than a pressured, revealing change.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eleanor is specific and coherent: a late-night, intellectually playful librarian whose belief in “analog memories” and “archivist of the unseen” identity drives her actions. Her restlessness is clearly motivated and leads to the midnight experiment. Internal conflict is relatively soft—she’s discontent but not deeply torn—so the final shift lands more as confirmation than hard-won change. The young patron functions mainly as a foil rather than a true pressure on Eleanor’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—her obsessive dawn ritual and “painter of absences” reputation embody her longing. Interiority is vivid if somewhat generalized at times, with strongest moments when her fear that the dream is “already too late” leaks into process detail. The final shift from chasing to embracing is emotionally earned, though the cost (giving up the chase/capture fantasy) could be made more viscerally conflicted on the page. Internal contradiction (hope vs. resignation, control vs. surrender) is present but could be sharpened in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s goal and core traits (quiet intensity, “unassumingly bold”) are clear and consistent, and his choice to defy the woman’s fear is well-motivated. Interiority is competent but remains somewhat generalized (“improbable longing”) rather than deeply particularized. His internal conflict—respecting her terror vs his belief in revelation—could be more sharply dramatized in the moment of unlocking. The closing realization about secrets healing is earned but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and consistent: an aging, obsessive folklorist whose curiosity has quietly consumed his life, with tactile details like aching knees and the brass sextant grounding him. His motivation—to understand the greenhouse and Clara’s disappearance—clearly drives every on-page choice. Internal contradiction is mild (skepticism vs belief), and the emotional cost of his long obsession is more implied than dramatized. Still, his final stance of embracing the greenhouse as a “bridge” reads as an earned, character-particular reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael is sharply sketched—the backwards walking, tea-geometry, and exile-as-archive make her feel particular and motivated, and her decision to help the stranger is consistent with that setup. The young woman is more generic but her desperation is legible and grounded in a concrete want (save her village). Internal contradiction in Lirael (duty vs. restlessness, fear of her mirrors vs. using them) is hinted at rather than really dramatized, so the final lightening of her heart feels modest rather than hard-won. Relationships and status dynamics are clear but under limited pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her embodied relationship to the trees and tools grounds her convincingly. However, her internal life under pressure is relatively unconflicted—once the seed “speaks,” she moves straight from resolve to success without much simultaneous doubt or contrary impulse. The sacrifice of the heirloom seed registers as meaningful but emotionally underdeveloped for this standard. The closing repricing (“wonder was not a finite thing”) fits her, but the shift feels gently asserted rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to mend and to ground spirits while fleeing her own past) is clear and coherent, and her fear of “what I’ll find” gives her at least one credible inner contradiction. Her craft-based competence (unraveling, grounding) maps well onto the emotional work she’s avoiding. Elias is more archetype than person—“moved like smoke and spoke in riddles”—which keeps the relationship from fully becoming a crucible. The final shift to “awake. Alive.” feels earned but not deeply costly, limiting how far the characterization can carry.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (intellectual curiosity plus family legacy) is clear and consistent, and his choices cleanly drive the story. Interiority is concrete enough (his breath fogging the lens, the chill of the vault) and tied to his profession. However, he faces little genuine inner conflict or contradictory impulse; he largely glides from puzzle to enlightenment. The final realization feels earned but nearly frictionless, with minimal visible cost beyond effort and awe.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief, intellect, and history with her mother are specific and coherent, and her motivation to study “the physics of letting go” feels organically rooted in that backstory. Her analytic temperament shows in how she works the tape and cross-references data, and the snow globe connection is a strong character-object bond. However, internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized—there are few on-page micro-choices under pressure beyond taking the globe and deciding to reinterpret her work. The final shift toward transmission over release is credible but lands closer to an articulated thesis than a hard-won, messily embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to express what he can’t speak—is clear and consistent, with the balladeer-who-isn’t-heard angle nicely reinforcing his resort to coding messages. His relationships to Lira, his brother, and his grandmother add texture, but those ties remain mostly one-sided recollections rather than pressured, on-page dynamics. Internal conflict (silence vs need to speak) is present but gentle, never quite forcing a hard, costly choice. The final “maybe” about the unspoken needs finding home feels like endurance rather than a sharply earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s mix of duty, curiosity, and emerging moral courage is well-drawn, and her micro-choices (reading the diary, keeping it, then choosing what to share) track cleanly with that nature. The widow moves beyond a stock “grieving aristocrat” via small cracks—her trembling hands, the way she clings to the goggles. Internal conflict is present but mild; Mara doesn’t visibly struggle between obedience and curiosity so much as glide toward the right choice. The final gesture—pressing the widow’s chest and asserting “I ascend”—lands as a credible, earned stance rather than an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lila’s motivation (to vindicate her theory and metabolize grief) is clear and consistent, and her embodied engagement with the telescope and notebook grounds her. Internal contradiction is relatively mild—she’s more steadfast than torn—so the emotional arc feels more like deepening than genuine struggle. Voss works as a skeptical foil, but their dynamic stays schematic and doesn’t quite force a hard, costly choice. The closing stance (“it’ll change me”) is earned but low-intensity in terms of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s perception (face-blind, memorizing “souls through textures and hues”) is vivid and particular, and her curiosity credibly drives the discovery of the panel and the choice to paint the sky. Her motives around preservation vs. obedience to the commission feel organic. The main weakness is an underplayed internal conflict over taking the safe and effectively stealing the guild’s secret; she moves through that decision almost too smoothly for this to hit elite-level depth.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s curiosity is concrete and motivates each step, from sneaking to the cargo hold to leaping into the portal, and her map-apprentice mindset gives her a specific perceptual lens. However, internal conflict is light: she rarely hesitates or struggles emotionally over the danger of the leap versus obedience or self-preservation. Jax functions well as a skeptical but supportive foil, adding social pressure and a hint of history. The final change—having “charted the next great discovery”—is credible but could land harder if the personal cost or inner shift were more textured.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation—honoring his father and mastering “the rhythm of repair”—is clear and consistently rooted in his history. Interiority is specific enough (the sea, the workshop, the scent of oil and iron) to feel personal, not generic. Internal conflict (pressure vs doubt) is present but mild; he never truly wavers or risks a wrong choice. The final sense of inner mending is credible but carries limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s altruism, consistency, and attachment to the bell make her feel specific and emotionally legible, and her motive to protect Luminara is clear throughout. However, she faces almost no internal contradiction or morally difficult choice; her goodness is untested. The settlers function as an undifferentiated mass, offering no relational crucible on the page. The ending gives her a gentle endurance/renunciation (fading back into twilight) but with little felt cost tied to a revealed flaw or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s vocation, habits, and relationship to her grandfather give her a specific, embodied interiority, and her doubt versus duty conflict is legible at the climax. Her micro-choices (climbing, using the puppet, committing to the song despite fear) track cleanly with her motives. The acceptance of her own flaws at the end feels earned by prior setup, though the realization is stated rather than dramatically resisted in-scene. A deeper dramatization of contradictory impulses under peak pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s reluctance, resentment toward the birds, and sense of cursed duty feel specific and embodied (“the trees’ roots” as punishment, his jerky, ungraceful movements). His motivation to help the traveler despite fear is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction under peak pressure could be deepened beyond a simple duty-vs-self-preservation axis. The traveler herself is a pure functionary with no weight as a character, which slightly blunts the emotional cost of his choice. The final endurance—curse “satisfied—for now”—reads as earned stasis but lands more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—polymer metaphors, scientific perception, and grief all color how she thinks—and her motivation to repair things with Mara is clear and consistent. The moment she chooses to respond “On my way” grows credibly from the river/foam insight. However, her internal conflict is relatively smooth; resistance and self-sabotage don’t get much on-page time, so the reconciliation reads a bit easy. Mara is sketched with clear traits (cellist, tense, guarded), but her own conflicting impulses under pressure are only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motive—seeking where stories begin—is clear and consistently refracted through her work with absences, and her unease after the man’s request feels psychologically credible. Her interiority is particular (“quantifying absence,” her fixation on the missing jar) rather than generic. However, she faces limited on-page pressure; we don’t see her impulses truly conflict or degrade under stress. The final shift is more a gentle clarification than a choice with visible personal cost, which keeps this below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Nessar’s motivation—to blunt the fortress’s collective remorse—is clear, specific, and very well tied to his unusual ability and profession. His internal tension (helper/healer impulse vs the danger of absorbing guilt) is present but could be slightly more sharpened on the page. Embodied reactions (numb fingers, tingling tongue, unsteady legs) sell the emotional cost credibly. Relationships are minimal, so we miss a chance to see his contradictions tested interpersonally.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motivation—to bridge the divide between village and scholars via rehabilitating the clock—reads clear and consistent, and her occupational details (choral librarian, polyglot repairer) feel specific. However, she is almost entirely virtuous and competent, with little visible flaw, ambivalence, or internal contradiction under pressure. The emotional arc moves in a straight line from resolve to success without much genuine doubt or competing impulse. As a result, the final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and particular—recovering from bureaucratic failure by literally excavating abandoned dreams—and his technical mindset comes through in concrete choices with the tools. Interiority is vivid and specific (e.g., “chaotically precise” hands, fascination with synaptic plasticity) rather than generic. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are underplayed; he’s briefly overwhelmed but recovers without lasting damage or a hard trade-off. The final “becoming the archeologist of abandoned dreams” feels emotionally earned but a bit tidy and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and specific, and her archivist mindset colors how she engages with the grotto and manuscript. However, her inner life is mostly goal-focused; we get limited contradiction or moral friction, and her promotion from “archivist” to “keeper of thresholds” reads more aspirational than costly. Embodied emotion is present but somewhat generalized (“her heart raced,” “fingers trembling”). The closing identity shift feels earned but emotionally underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—to make the silent world sing—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (returning daily, bleeding nails, enduring fatigue). Interiority is present but relatively simple; she’s almost entirely defined by devotion to her art, with little contradictory impulse or moral ambiguity. The emotional embodiment (listening with her bones, weeping at the climax) is strong and specific. The “change” is more an affirmation and extension of who she already is than a hard-won internal turn with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Alaric’s motivation—redeeming his “heresy” and reviving the covenant through his chess-inflected worldview—is clear, coherent, and carries through to the final planting of the star-seed. His interiority is specific (chess metaphors, attention to constraints) and embodied via gestures like tracing the stone and feeling the nexus’s hum. Internal contradiction is present but mild: regret over exile vs. stubborn fidelity to his method, rather than a sharply torn conflict. The closing stance shift—from solitary, doubtful exile to quiet custodian of a living covenant—feels earned, if emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s core motivation and sensibility are clear and coherent, and the tactile, observant way she moves through the workshop gives her some specificity. However, her pacifism and “collector of quiet moments” identity are more labels than active, pressuring traits. Internal conflict is muted; she never feels genuinely divided or at risk of choosing wrongly. The final realization about empathy lands a bit too smoothly, without enough prior contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation and arc (ambition tempered into patient attention) are clear and consistent, and her olfactory focus gives her interiority a specific texture. The tension between her drive and the seed’s need for stillness is present but could be more sharply dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses rather than framed mostly as “before epiphany/after epiphany.” Emotional states are often conveyed through summary (“her doodles growing jagged”) rather than fully embodied moments, which keeps us slightly outside her most pressured beats. The change at the end feels earned, but the cost of that change is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s goal and competence are clear, and her piloting and investigative choices drive the story, but her inner life is thinly rendered. We see almost no contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from curiosity to acceptance without real struggle. The realization that the planet must be “protected” reads as an asserted stance more than a hard-won psychological turn. Adding one moment where exploitation genuinely tempts her would deepen the felt cost of her final role as guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Anya’s motivation (professional duty braided with the mentor’s death) is clear and consistent, and her embodied competence reads credibly. However, internal contradiction is light—she mainly performs as a focused pro, with little on-page tension between fear, grief, and analytic drive. The engineer functions more as a mouthpiece of concept than as a pressure-bearing character. The ending registers more as increased understanding than as a felt, costly internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to “certify wonder as essential” and free the cavern’s voice—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (lifting the bell, using the amber sheet, committing to song). Her synesthetic perception gives her interiority a specific texture. However, internal conflict is minimal; she never seriously doubts, falters, or pays a discernible emotional price beyond brief discomfort with the oppressive silence. Veyra’s shift from skeptic to believer happens quickly and smoothly, with little resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motivations (duty, grief, fear of failure, craving insight) are clear and consistently dramatized, and his choices—playing the flute twice, dropping it, then re-marking the driftwood—track well with those motives. The confrontation with his “past selves” and the breaking of the flute show genuine internal conflict rather than tidy self-awareness. His shift from control to surrender at the end feels earned and costs him a cherished identity as flawless keeper. A few lines drift toward aphoristic summary (“To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current and learn to swim”), slightly flattening the otherwise embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—his belief that emotions are solvable equations—which credibly drives his risky experiment with the fragment. The piece earns his conceptual and emotional shift by forcing him to inhabit others’ feelings, not just think about them. His flaw (detached analysis, borrowed personalities) is integrated into his arc, though the abandonment of personality-borrowing at the end feels slightly tidy. Veyra adds pressure and emotional texture, but her side of the relationship could be deepened further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kail’s jitteriness, mistrust of the relic, and complicated attachment to Veyra are clearly dramatized and consistent, especially in his hesitation before planting the seed. His interiority is specific enough (e.g., wondering if he’s meant to *feel* the relic’s purpose) and not over-explained. The epiphany about being “the soil” is a bit too neat and aphoristic, softening the sense of cost. The hooded woman functions mainly as a thematic/messianic delivery system rather than as a full character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive (to prove her theory and win validation) is clear and drives every beat, and her interiority is specific—her doubt as the visions intensify feels earned. The final renunciation of her theory lands as an authentic cost. However, internal contradiction could be sharpened; we see doubt arise, but we don’t feel simultaneous, competing impulses under real pressure. A few emotional notes (“sickening lurch,” “voice trembling”) are slightly generic for a piece aiming at top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (restore sound, honor her grandmother’s legacy, decode the bead’s message) is clear and consistent, and her sacrifice at the end feels earned. Interiority is generally concrete and specific—her rituals with the bead, her conversations with the loom—but her internal conflict over staying versus leaving the orchard is implied more than dramatized. The core renunciation (letting the bead go, choosing to weave silence) lands with credible cost. A slightly sharper sense of her flaws or blind spots under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jorin’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in his quiet stubbornness, and his choice to go into the mines despite Mara’s warning tracks well with that. Interiority is somewhat sparse and leans on generalities (“quiet fire,” “quiet defiance”) rather than really idiosyncratic, embodied thought, which keeps him from feeling fully singular. His final endurance in the shard cavern fits his established temperament but lacks much sense of fear, doubt, or competing impulses in the moment. Lira and Mara function mainly as archetypal mouthpieces (guardian, village elder) with little pressure or complexity beyond their single-note roles.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s core drive—finding the truth about his mother and the shard—is clear and consistent, and his final renunciation is motivated by that history. Interiority is specific enough (the shard as a second heartbeat, the ache when its pull fades) to individualize him. However, his internal conflict (compulsion vs. caution vs. grief) tends to be summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices, which makes his final acceptance feel slightly easy. The mother-variant is mostly functional, with limited texture beyond her role as expositor and catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly drawn—reticent, competent, shaped by decades with the sea—and his gradual softening toward the letters and the ritual feels earned. His motivation (curiosity shading into a need for connection/safety) is coherent and drives each small choice. Internal contradiction is present but mild; he’s lonely yet wary of superstition, but this tension never bites very hard. The endurance/acceptance at the end carries cost implicitly (admitting need), though it could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Herald’s motivation—to “see the dawn” and shape it—remains clear and consistent, and her occupational specificity as a storm herald feels distinct. However, she’s almost entirely confident and competent; there’s very little internal contradiction or genuine doubt under pressure. The few darker notes (recognition of the oily shadow, awareness that light/dark are twins) don’t meaningfully complicate her stance. The closing acceptance of her role lands but feels low-cost, more confirmation than hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lin’s characterization is specific and textured—the dye master with a donor heart, split self-perception, and bone-deep hunger for stories feels vivid and individual. Her motives are clear and consistent, and the transplant reframes how she reads light and people. However, internal conflict remains relatively low-friction; her final decision to devote herself to illuminating others’ stories comes smoothly, without much on-page resistance or cost. The emotional turn is credible but not deeply contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s vocation and curiosity are clear, and his choices (dismantling the sextant, stepping through the wall, touching the roots) align with that characterization. However, his interiority stays mostly in a single register of calm, thoughtful competence without much contradiction or real emotional risk. The realization that quantified sorrow is “a language” arrives with little struggle or internal conflict. As a result, he feels interesting but not yet fully three-dimensional at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s core motivation (rekindling a dying realm via memory) is clear and her actions align with it, but her interior life is idealized and low-conflict. We get exhaustion and loneliness at the end, yet little genuine contradiction or moral ambiguity under pressure. Her “scattered memory keeper” nature is evocative but not deeply dramatized in how it complicates choices. The closing endurance feels earned but relatively low-cost for the scale of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eleanor’s characterization as a compassionate recluse is consistent, textured, and grounded in specific choices (coming to the Society to “hide,” following the map, choosing to stay). Her grief and ambivalence—wanting to observe without being seen yet craving connection to her mother—create a believable internal contradiction. Emotional responses are largely embodied and particular (e.g., tracing the invitation, tears in the mirror chamber). The main limitation is that her final acceptance feels a touch smooth, with relatively low visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly defined—a hyper-attentive, cautious seeker of the sacred—and his gentleness and attentiveness align with his actions in the tea house and garden. His shift from wary observer to committed tender of the garden is believable, though the internal conflict is relatively low-friction and rarely pits true competing impulses against each other. The woman’s brief appearance affirms, rather than tests, his stance, so relational pressure remains light. The arc lands as a quiet softening rather than a choice with sharply felt cost, which keeps this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—the meticulous, duty-bound archivist fighting entropy—but she remains relatively one-note emotionally. Her frustration (“Frustration gnawed at her.”) and stubbornness under pressure are convincing, yet we rarely see true inner contradiction or a costlier moral/psychological conflict. The final shift from near-despair to satisfied relief is credible but not especially deep. Strong, functional characterization, not yet at the level of layered, unforgettable interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—stop the device and grapple with her father’s legacy—and we see her make specific, pressured choices, especially in sacrificing the watch and smashing the recorder after hearing his betrayal. Her stubbornness is dramatized through failed attempts rather than just labeled. Internal contradiction is present but relatively light; she never seriously considers preserving the recording or trading with the buyer, which would add more bite. Secondary characters are thin but functional antagonistic pressures rather than people.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation and methods (the compass, tasting weather) are vivid and specific, and his skepticism gives him a clear worldview. However, his internal conflict barely complicates his choices in the moment—he mostly observes and then passively reassesses. The shift from “luminous skeptic” to someone who accepts the terrestrially cosmic feels a bit swift and lightly costed. Lira functions more as an exposition vector than as a source of real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s core motivation—relieving his creative blockage—is clear, consistent, and well linked to his history as a portraitist and his grandmother’s influence. However, much of his conflict (art vs. stability, fear vs. calling) is summarized rather than dramatized in present-tense micro-choices, so the internal struggle feels slightly under-pressured. His final relief after unlocking the “door” comes quickly, with limited sense of ambivalence or visible cost in the moment. Strong but not yet at the depth or messiness expected for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s goal and traits (calligrapher turned scavenger, lie-detecting quill, grief for her mother) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—venturing into 7-B, confronting the keeper, choosing to “plant the seed”—track cleanly from those motives. The relationship with the keeper has a nice power shift as her certainty about the lie forces their admission. Internal contradiction (hope for the Archive vs readiness to accept its loss) is present but could be deepened; she absorbs the devastating news with almost too much composure. The final stance—accepting echoes as “seed”—is earned but skims the emotional cost rather than dwelling in it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve “the color of wonder” through bells and silence—is clear and consistently expressed in action (her vow of muteness, building the sculpture, continuing to tune). However, she faces almost no on-page resistance or genuine dilemma, so internal contradiction and pressured micro-choices are limited. Emotional states are mostly implied through serene, lyrical description rather than embodied conflict. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, more confirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara-7’s motivation—contain chaos, protect the farm, resolve her inner static—is clear and consistently dramatized, and the choice to absorb the orb aligns with her established caretaker nature. Her interiority (e.g., nostalgia in “Childhood Fears,” humming old Earth records) is specific enough to feel individual rather than generic. However, internal conflict is somewhat under-pressured: she recognizes risk but moves to the solution without much hesitation, doubt, or competing impulse on the page. The “fragmented wholeness” realization lands, but with relatively low visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s curiosity and reverence for objects are clear and consistently motivate her actions, and her small emotional arc—from routine to moved witness—is believable. However, her interiority stays relatively surface-level; we don’t see much contradiction or true internal conflict under pressure. The neighbors function more as exposition devices than as characters exerting real pressure on her. The final emotional response (tears, sense of fate) is earned but somewhat generic rather than deeply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to recover the scientist’s truth/antidote and honor her philosophy—is clear, consistent, and drives each choice, from following the dance to facing the drones. His interiority is specific (“translating her grief into equations, her rage into algorithms”), giving him texture beyond a stock adventurer. However, internal contradiction is muted; he moves with near-constant competence and admiration rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final reconfiguration (embracing vulnerability as lived practice) is emotionally credible but could land harder if we saw him genuinely tempted by a less vulnerable path.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s grief and obsession with lost memories are clear, concrete, and consistently drive his actions (coffee divination, entering the tunnel, offering the flowers). His interiority is specific enough—pressed wildflowers, memories of his wife—to feel human rather than generic. However, we see little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; he moves quite straightforwardly toward the goal without being pulled in competing directions. The final shift to “no longer feared the pockets” reads as slightly tidy and low-cost given the depth of his loss.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The summoner’s core motive and competence are clear and consistent, but she remains largely untested, with little contradictory impulse or cost on the page. Her interiority has some specificity (“silence was not emptiness but a language”) yet rarely reveals real doubt, fear, or self-deception. The result is a poised figure more emblematic than fully human. The final beat confirms her purpose without forcing a difficult trade-off or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias and the woman are both sharply sketched through occupation, habits, and conversational status, and their rapport feels lived-in. His motivation (curiosity about the building and seal) is clear and consistent, and her blend of mischief and guarded knowledge works. Internal conflict is comparatively light—Elias never meaningfully wavers between belief and skepticism or safety and risk—so the final choice feels intriguing but low-cost. A deeper, more contradictory interiority under pressure would lift this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid and particular—“charmed skeptic” and “tragically radiant” feel like lived contradictions, and her habit of archiving pain is consistent and dramatized. Her core motivation (to transform quarantined pain into something usable) is legible and drives her choices with the shells. The main weakness is that the final shift from lifelong pattern to newfound calm feels a touch swift and tidy relative to the depth of the wound. More visible ambivalence or backsliding in the climactic ritual would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s motivation—“to forgive the unfinished”—is clear, particular, and coherently drives every micro-choice, from stealing ink to bleeding onto the page. Interior contradiction (treason as forgiveness; lie as truth) is present but mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under pressure. Embodied emotion is strong in places (her trembling with the thorn, aching joints) but she never faces a genuine on-page dilemma or pushback. The final act of stowing the scroll reads as an earned, consistent endurance rather than a transformative turn with heavy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s core motivation (to understand why some people echo) is clear and consistently expressed, and his vocation as an echo singer gives him a plausible way of engaging the world. However, he lacks real internal contradiction or visible flaw; his emotional responses stay within a single, earnest register. The final “purpose is clearer than ever” realization is believable but relatively low-cost, with little evidence of a path foreclosed or a value truly contested. The hooded figure functions more as an exposition-delivery device than a crucible for his character.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s vocation, temperament, and moral stance are clear and consistent, and his gentleness with the living and dead is well dramatized through his choice to work via dreams. However, he faces little real resistance, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, which flattens his interiority. The sailor’s emotions are sketched effectively in the dream fragments, but they function more as articulated themes than as pressured characters. The final decision to “weave [truth] into the fabric of the living’s dreams” feels emotionally apt but comes without a strong sense of cost or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael is clearly defined as a contemplative, blue-collar philosopher whose actions (climbing the parapet, following the whistle, engaging with the fireflies) all align with his desire to perceive hidden effort. His interiority is specific and embodied enough to feel individual (net-mending, grandfather’s teachings) rather than generic. However, there is virtually no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; he never faces a pressured choice or real risk, which flattens the emotional arc. The final “insight” is earned texturally but comes without visible cost or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives (truth-seeking sliding into survival) are clear and consistent, and her professional habits (pattern-hunting, puzzle-solving) inform her actions. However, her internal conflict at the climax is sketched more than inhabited; the “sacrifice” feels intellectually acknowledged rather than emotionally lived. We don’t see much contradiction or degradation under stress—she stays composed and competent throughout. The final choice is motivated and coherent but not deeply personalized in a way that would expose more specific flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation (to shape a new dawn, allegiance to fragility) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—staying in isolation, decoding riddles, finally activating the mechanism—track well. Interiority is textured and particular, though the piece leans more on idea than on embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure. His shift from rejecting “prophet” to accepting “You are the prism. You are the storm.” is credible but emotionally under-costed. We see resolve more than genuine struggle or loss in that final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific—the penny poet scavenging sounds to “sweeten the world’s sharp edges” is vivid and coherent. His emotions are embodied (tears at the lullaby, the weight lifting) and his micro-choices (which jars to open, walking through the village) align with his aim. What’s missing at a top-tier level is genuine internal contradiction or a hard, costly choice; once the box works, his path is emotionally smooth. The final stance (“not to be remembered, but to remember”) is graceful but arrives without much on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (protecting the key and family legacy) is clear and sustained, and his engineer’s mindset versus bone-deep resonance offers a credible inner tension. His micro-choices under pressure (standing his ground, choosing harmony over banishment) track well with that setup. The ghost functions more as an archetypal antagonist than a fully individuated presence, which slightly flattens relational complexity. The emotional cost at the end (exhaustion, quiet vigil) lands but could be sharpened with one more specific, contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation and interiority are clear—he wants to “unyoke” the viaduct and gradually internalizes the elders’ ethic of patience—but his internal conflict remains mild, with only a brief flare of frustration before he corrects course. The physical embodiment (aching back, breath, gloved hands, soft curses) grounds him, and his shift from haste to “softly purposeful” is credible if understated. The elders and acolyte function more as thematic mirrors than real sources of pressure. The final sense of him as “keeper of the moon’s path” is earned, though the personal cost feels limited to fatigue and slow discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s professional lens, simmering suspicion, and final reclaiming of agency are clear and mostly well-motivated, and her embodied reactions (trembling, jaw tightening, not flinching at the train) keep her grounded. The “watchfully calm” trait is shown as well as told, though her internal conflict remains relatively straightforward rather than richly contradictory. Her realization about Cole’s full manipulation and the scale of the “tests” comes very quickly, feeling a touch convenient rather than earned through layered blind spots and partial corrections. Still, the closing stance shift—using the lantern and facts against Cole—is credibly rooted in what we’ve seen of her.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marcus is clearly drawn as cautious, morally serious, and moved by tangible symbols like the clockwork heart, and Mrs. Elms has a gentle, grounded presence. His motivation—to give a responsible judgment about the program—is coherent and carries through. However, his inner conflict is understated; there’s little sense of genuine risk or contradiction beyond mild suspicion turning to approval. The final resolve feels more like confirmation than a hard-won shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s obsession, irreverence (“gears with feet”), and stubbornness are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (aligning the arrow with the glass, launching into the acid wind) follow clearly from them. Motivation is strong but internal conflict is minimal; she rarely hesitates or feels genuinely torn. Emotion stays largely in the register of excitement and curiosity, with little layered fear or doubt under peak pressure. The final choice to risk everything to ring the bell feels earned but could land harder with a more explicit sense of what she’s risking beyond generic danger.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her attachment to Elara and the patch gives her a distinct emotional core. However, her inner life remains relatively straightforward—more driven than conflicted—so we don’t see much contradictory impulse under pressure. Hale functions as a flat, purely obstructive antagonist, which lowers the sense of complex human stakes. The final choice to upload the coordinates and go rogue is motivated but could carry more embodied fear or doubt to deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is vivid and particular—“shadow-laced peacekeeper” with aurora-silvered skin—and her core motivation to soothe a storm of fear via empathy is consistent. Her calmly intuitive approach is dramatized in the mirror sequence, and her final act with the fragment aligns with her values. However, internal contradiction and genuine struggle under pressure are muted; she never seriously doubts, fails, or hesitates in a way that complicates her choice. The resolution feels earned but emotionally smoothed, with limited visible cost or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s numbness, euthanasia motive, and quiet competence create a coherent, particular interiority, and her impulsive decision to hook the boat with the parasol reads credibly as an extension of that. The “changed” state is mostly told rather than dramatized in scene, and her death wish never truly comes under direct pressure, which limits the depth of contradiction on the page. Still, her small reorientation toward “the precise instant when action became inevitable” feels earned by prior behavior. Secondary characters are thin but functional foils rather than true relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific and convincing as the quiet, observant sentinel whose choices (showing the letter, reframing Lila’s block) track cleanly with his beliefs. Lila’s pain is clear but somewhat generalized (“failed relationships,” “stalled career”) and her shift toward openness comes a bit quickly and cleanly. Interiority skews summary rather than embodied contradiction, especially for Lila. The final “two mismatched souls” stance is emotionally plausible but lightly earned for work aiming at elite literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is distinct—scarred, duty-bound, “strangely honest,” with a concrete vocation—and her bond to the echo of wisdom feels grounded. The prophet is thinner but serviceable as a catalyst and ritual partner. Motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict is minimal; she never seriously wavers or pays a visible price. The ending reads as earned endurance rather than a hard-won transformation, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lila is clearly motivated by grief, memory, and artistic practice, and her rituals (the annual visits, the journal, the map case) feel specific and lived-in. Her emotional landscape is gently but convincingly sketched, with an arc from striving for a “masterpiece” toward accepting the existing beauty. However, she rarely experiences on-page contradiction or real pressure; her calmness flattens potential friction. The result is a strong but low-intensity characterization that doesn’t fully test her values.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a solitary, word-obsessed scholar whose need to "testify" to a hidden pattern pushes him out of habitual reticence. His internal contradiction—comfort in silence versus urgency to share—is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressured. Emotional texture tends to be contemplative rather than conflicted, yet his arc from observer to would-be communicator feels earned. The cost of that shift (professional risk, vulnerability) is implied more than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s longing and frustration are clear, embodied in concrete rituals (chalk, driftwood, daily returns to the garden) that make him feel particular rather than archetypal. The precognitive forgetfulness effectively creates a lived tension between his desire to grasp the future and his inability to hold it. Internal contradiction is present but somewhat soft—he mostly wants a single thing rather than being visibly torn between opposed impulses in scene. His final stance shift (“didn’t need to see the future anymore”) is emotionally plausible but lands a little neatly given the depth of his earlier obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motives (harnessing the ephemeral, refusing to flee) are clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete choices (staying, experimenting, leaping). His professional competence is vivid, but internal contradiction is light—there’s little real hesitation once the portal appears. The desire to “tame” time versus accepting escape from it is implied but not dramatized as an active struggle. The final leap feels earned but could carry more explicitly embodied, conflicted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s characterization is specific and convincing: the vinyl shard, her ritual with music, and her professional calm undercut by personal grief all read as lived-in. Her motivation—to execute a flawless goodbye—is clear and drives her choices, especially in orchestrating Elias and Clara’s moment. The relationship between father and daughter is sketched efficiently through gestures and one line of dialogue. The main limitation is that Mira’s internal conflict stays relatively controlled; she rarely feels at risk of making a mistake or being overwhelmed, which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motivation (understanding sealed awakenings / where shadows go) is clear and consistent, and her methodical temperament comes through, but her interior life remains relatively thin. We’re told she’s exhausted yet sharp, but there’s little contradiction, doubt, or fear under pressure to deepen her humanity. The final realization changes her knowledge, not her value hierarchy or self-concept, so the “cost” is mostly conceptual. Stronger embodied emotion or a visible tradeoff during the key-turning moment would raise this.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s skepticism, curiosity, and unresolved hurt over Elias are well-grounded and drive her choices, and Elias’s mixture of regret and mischief feels coherent. The reunion reshapes their dynamic credibly, and her final stance—a tempered skepticism that allows forgiveness—emerges from prior beats. However, internal conflict stays relatively tidy; we don’t see her truly torn or behaving irrationally under pressure. The forgiveness realization comes smoothly rather than through a moment of real emotional risk or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—honoring her mother’s teachings by finding a way to share light without fire—is clear, consistent, and concretely dramatized through her gem work. Interiority is specific (“stillness wasn’t emptiness—it was the space between heartbeats”), though her emotional progression is relatively smooth, with limited felt contradiction or real struggle under pressure. The key renunciation—letting the pearl drift away—lands, but the cost feels conceptual more than viscerally dramatized. The mother–daughter relationship functions strongly as a ghost pressure despite the mother being off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s grief, guilt, and need for connection are specific and embodied through the pendant, the drip-map, and her choice to invite Elias to stay, and her vulnerability shift at the end feels earned. The “proactive about grief” line edges toward therapy-speak but is buffered by concrete behavior. Elias is a bit idealized—he mostly facilitates her growth rather than pressing back with his own flaws or stakes, which slightly softens the crucible quality of their dynamic. Still, the final choice to alter the pendant and ask him to remain grows convincingly from the earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s conflict about “neat endings” is clear, her artistic dissatisfaction motivates her trip, and her decision to delete the last chapter feels causally grounded. However, her interior struggle resolves a bit too smoothly once the double appears; contradictory impulses don’t really grind against each other in scene. The cost of embracing uncertainty is more asserted than felt. The mist-woman is thematically apt but functions more as a device than as a pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to restore the arbor’s fading magic and sacred practices—is clear, consistent, and nicely grounded in her grandmother’s influence. Her agency is strong, with concrete choices (building the lyre, playing through pain, inviting the community) that reveal values. However, there is almost no internal contradiction or genuine moral friction; she is competent, kind, and essentially untroubled, which limits depth. The visible cost is mostly physical exhaustion and the spent tendril, which keeps the arc on the gentler side.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—sealing the starlight to unlock “translating heartbeats into maps”—is clear and consistent, and his meticulousness under cold discomfort gives him some texture. However, he faces little internal contradiction or moral friction; his patience is virtuous but not really in conflict with any opposing impulse in the scene. The emotional climax (“In that moment, he understood…”) is somewhat generalized and comes easily once the ritual works. Overall, he feels specific but not yet fully complex for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn—competent, observant, with a sideways approach to problems—and his locksmith mindset maps well onto the puzzle he’s solving. However, his internal conflict is mild: he wonders whether “reason’s cellar” is a grave, but this doubt never forces a hard choice or visible cost. Emotions stay understated and mostly intellectual, with little embodied stress or failure on the way to success. The ending offers a subtle shift in understanding, but not a deeply tested, high-stakes internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s vocation, history with the grotto, and relationship to his mother give him clear, specific motivation that holds through the piece. His micro-choices with each burden, especially the obsidian and his refusal to touch the locket, reveal a coherent value hierarchy (“respect the weight, not the wound”). Internal contradiction is present but quiet rather than sharply dramatized; he feels the pull toward his mother’s niche but backs away before the tension fully spikes. The emotional life is convincing, but a slightly deeper embodiment under peak pressure would elevate this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s grief, avoidance, and decision to finally carve the lion are coherent and well-motivated, with concrete actions (opening the chest, sharpening the knife, placing the carving) that track her internal state. Her interiority is specific—kettle, honey, sawdust, and remembered performance all feel embodied rather than abstract. However, her conflict is a bit too smooth; contradictory impulses (revulsion/attraction to the wood, resistance/desire to remember) are implied more than dramatized in the moment-to-moment choices. The final stance of “understanding” edges toward ease, muting the sense of real cost or unresolved messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s interiority is specific and consistent—her mix of worn-down ambition, compulsive scavenging, and self-blame tracks cleanly to every choice, especially treating the camera wheel as a “key.” The dynamic with the ghost (as her younger self) functions well as a crucible for her contradictions, with the ghost pressing her clinging to fragments versus desire to move on. Her decisive act of dropping the camera wheel and then allowing herself to rest/leave feels earned by prior beats. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is a slight abstraction in how her guilt is rooted—her responsibility for the carousel’s halt and her mother’s death remains more gestured at than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lila’s competence, curiosity, and “functional creativity” are clearly motivated and consistently dramatized through her exploration and tinkering. However, she lacks a tangible internal contradiction or layered emotional struggle; her restlessness never sharpens into a real dilemma. The final decision to leave and return later feels earned but low-cost. Strong functional characterization, but not yet psychologically rich enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is vividly drawn: the introverted, meticulous clock scribe whose inner restlessness pushes her out into the forecourt. Her conflicting impulses—safety in the keep vs the “wilds”—are legible and play simultaneously in the bear scene, not in alternation. The final renunciation (staying but on new terms) is motivated by prior traits and experiences. The only weakness is a slight reliance on abstracted thought (“silence could be a kind of violence”) where more embodied contradiction under peak pressure would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to uncover how lies are built—is clear and consistently expressed, and his choice to follow the sundial into the warehouse tracks with that drive. Interiority is present and character-specific (“to acknowledge the lies he’d told himself to survive”), but contradictory impulses under pressure remain underdeveloped—he encounters little real pushback from his own fear or doubt. The final realization feels earned but low-cost; we don’t see a concrete path foreclosed by his new clarity. The captain exists more as a warning voice than as a genuine relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vivid—a philosophical seed collector with a clear through-line from grandfather’s charge to his present work—and his motives are specific and consistent. We see him make micro-choices (kneeling to examine the glass, aligning it with each knot, calling to the fisherman) that fit his temperament. Internal contradiction is limited; he moves from curiosity to understanding without much friction or genuine doubt. The final repricing of the loom into “the act of preservation itself” is earned but emotionally gentle rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s vocation and worldview are specific and coherent, and her sensory/emotional attention feels character-driven. However, her inner life remains largely unconflicted—there’s little evidence of contradictory impulses or visible cost, so her change reads as refinement rather than hard-won. The vision sequence could have exposed a sharper tension between her need to explain absences and the possibility of leaving some mysteries intact. As is, she’s textured but not yet pressurized into revealing deeper flaws or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Corvin’s longing and obsession are clear and consistent, and his embodied desperation around the egg (“trembled,” “quaking reverie”) gives him particularity beyond a stock prince. His motivation—to reawaken beauty—credibly drives his actions and the final stance with the orb. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped: we rarely see him doubt, lash out, or misstep, so his change at the end feels more like vindication than a pressured evolution. Elder Thalos appears too late to significantly pressure Corvin’s choices or reveal new facets of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira is cleanly sketched—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter, carrying guilt and restlessness—and her choice to stay, help the bird, and then remain alone at the lagoon feels coherent with that backstory. Her compassion is nicely embodied in small, tactile choices (splinting the wing, giving up the coin). Internal conflict around her father is present but under-exploited; we’re told the guilt more than we feel it grinding against the present moment. Secondary characters are thin but functional as pressure on her core trait rather than fully realized people.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation (defiance, belief in unseen memories) is clear and consistent, and her paradoxical “luminous skeptic” nature is sketched with some specificity. We do see a live contradiction—skeptic vs imaginative realist—especially in “Show me… not of the fountain, but of herself.” However, emotional experience tends to be articulated abstractly rather than through richly embodied, character-peculiar sensations, and her ultimate “cost” (scraped fingers, fatigue) is fairly light. The final stance shift feels earned but not deeply agonized or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lumin’s motives are clear and consistent—longing for fire’s warmth, reverence for Enclave teachings, and obsession with generational patterns all cohere and drive choices. The internal conflict between inherited caution and radical curiosity is well sketched, especially in the ache for “a blaze that didn’t burn, but healed.” The great-grandmother’s presence sharpens this, but her acceptance comes very easily, softening visible cost. The closing resolve to “share it” feels earned but somewhat low-friction for the depth of taboo implied.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlow is specific and credible—a gravestone carver with a family grief-ritual and a concrete emotional weight—and his choice to finally voice his own poem is motivated and earned. Interiority is solid but somewhat tidy; he moves from mute grief to articulation without much on-page resistance or contradiction under pressure. Embodied emotion is present in sensory perceptions rather than labeled feelings, which works well. The internal change at the end (carving from love rather than loss) is clear but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lirael is clearly motivated by duty and inherited responsibility, and her diligence is credibly embodied in details like “tracing the tower’s iron veins” at night. Interiority feels specific rather than generic, with the grandfather’s lesson providing a believable moral lens. However, internal conflict is minimal—she never seriously wavers or pays a sharp emotional price—so her arc reads as a competent fulfillment of role more than a pressured transformation. The final state is earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s curiosity and long-practiced intimacy with the dead are clear and consistent, and her motivation to “discover the shape of intentions” credibly drives her decoding of the tapestry. However, she faces little true inner conflict; there’s no strong contradictory impulse pushing against her drive to understand. The emotional cost of her final choice—to rebury the case but carry the knowledge—is implied rather than dramatized. This keeps the characterization strong but short of deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s vocation, methods, and stubborn belief in possibility are specific and consistent, and her embodied rituals (the quill, the nightly climbs) ground her. However, her interior conflict is light; she rarely wavers, so contradictory impulses under pressure don’t fully materialize. The social pressure from Elders and villagers is summarized more than dramatized in direct confrontation, which keeps her psychology a bit idealized. Burning the journals is a strong closing gesture, but its emotional cost could be deepened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation and inner lens are clear, specific, and grounded in her work as a copyist and survivor of the “story famine,” and her micro-choices (chasing the signal, ignoring the cloak slipping, writing feverishly) track that drive well. However, she’s largely single-impulse—there’s little contradictory desire or visible internal conflict to complicate her quest in the moment. The emotional cost of her obsession (loneliness, fatigue, risk) is implied more than dramatized. The final stance—quiet endurance and continued commitment—feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira is sharply etched—her soot-smeared hands, the porcelain mask, and her fixation on fleeting emotion create a specific, credible psyche, and her micro-choices (e.g., removing then re-donning the mask, leaving the portrait unfinished) read as coherent Earned Stasis rather than epiphany. The internal conflict between needing the “mirage of safety” and her compulsion to risk dissolution in the gallery is present, but could be dramatized under more acute pressure rather than largely asserted. Elias functions mainly as a thematic foil, but his wariness usefully externalizes the risk Lira is half-denying. Emotional states are mostly embodied and particular, with only a few generic phrases (“etched with fatigue and resolve”) softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his sewer-bound pseudo-philosophy, obsession with the cog, and stubborn idealism all read specific and consistent, and Mara is an effective foil. Motivation (preserve old navigation, resist “soulless efficiency”) clearly drives his refusal to sell and his relentless digging. Internal contradiction (self-aware “wannabe philosopher” who still clings to grand theses) is present but could be pushed harder in live conflict rather than in labels. The relationship does act as a crucible, with Mara’s pragmatism pressing him, though the emotional cost of choosing obsession over her perspective could be more embodied at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s motivation and emotional life are clear, specific, and embodied (“to braid diverse voices into harmony,” her reverent touch on the zither), and Elias’s regret and hesitancy give their interaction some lived texture. However, the internal conflict remains relatively low-friction: Clara never faces a genuinely destabilizing choice, and her doubts about the “dying” language of music never force a concrete sacrifice. The relationship does evolve from teacher–student distance toward a collaborative partnership, but without a sharp crucible moment. The ending reads more as gentle endurance than a path-foreclosing decision, which slightly softens impact at this elite bar.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core drive (to midwife beauty from ruin) is clear and coherently embodied in her scavenging, waiting for the alignment, and pruning choices, and her synesthetic gift is well-integrated into how she experiences stakes. Internal conflict exists but is mild—she is briefly shaken by violent memories and the plant’s “primal urge to cling,” yet never truly wavers or risks a morally fraught choice. Emotional texture leans on a few familiar gestures (“her chest heaving,” hands trembling) rather than more idiosyncratic embodiment. The closing stance shift—from private caretaker to community builder—is motivated, but the cost of that expansion is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clara is cleanly motivated—bored competence, social isolation via candor, and a latent wish to rekindle awe—so her shift into public truth-teller feels earned. Her involuntary honesty is dramatized through specific examples and reframed as a potential asset, not just a label. Internal conflict (candor as burden vs. tool) is present but could be pushed harder under real social resistance. Voss is serviceable but functions mainly as an exposition vector rather than a fully pressured counter-presence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira’s observational compulsion and curiosity are clear and consistent, and her choice to test the orris shard at the bay is motivated. However, she faces almost no resistance—internal or external—so we see little contradiction or emotional cost under pressure. Her emotional state stays relatively even, with minimal embodied tension despite the supposedly momentous experiment. The final understanding feels earned conceptually but not hard-won on an emotional level.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (find truth about her grandmother, stop the blight) is clear and her choices track cleanly from it, especially in trusting Lumen and drinking the ampoule. Lumen’s inner nature comes through in its image-based, nonverbal guidance and its steady, patient pressure. However, Mara’s emotional life is sketched more than deeply embodied—her fear, shock, and recalibration register, but with limited contradiction or textured irrationality. The internal shift from grief to understanding feels earned but somewhat tidy for the scale of what she learns.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael feels specific—grimly hopeful, mathematically inclined, haunted by a lost lover—and his actions (testing rupture, then choosing not to grasp the dice) grow credibly from those traits. Motivation is clear and sustained, and his mix of obsession and restraint reads true. Internal contradiction (need for motion vs. need to accept loss) is present but could be dramatized more in moment-to-moment micro-choices rather than mainly in exposition. The final acceptance stance is earned, though the emotional cost could be embodied a touch more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s interiority is specific and embodied—her sleeplessness, “methodically hopeful” cataloging of kindnesses, and ache for proof all feel lived-in and consistent. Her choice to paint Elena’s eyes from Mr. Voss’s ache, then to surrender the brush and ask to learn, constitutes a credible internal turn. Mr. Voss is sketched quickly but vividly, with his thermos, trembling hand, and sudden softness around the painting. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (need for proof vs fear it doesn’t exist) could be pushed into sharper contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lila’s vocation, sensibility, and motivation are cleanly drawn and consistent, and her small choices (baking CV, deciding on a festival, teaching the children) align with her drive to preserve art. The beekeeper and Celeste function more as emotional satellites than active relational crucibles, so we don’t see her values tested in direct interpersonal conflict. Internal conflict is present but gentle: she feels “rosewater dread” yet acts with resolve, without a strongly dramatized contradictory impulse. The final stance—committing to revival despite lingering dread—feels earned but low-cost at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsession with time and his father’s fate gives him a clear, particular motivation that cleanly drives every choice on the page. His blend of awe, bitterness, and terror (“caught between triumph and terror”) feels embodied and specific rather than generic. Internal contradiction—his fear of the stone’s hunger versus compulsion to push further—is present but could be deepened under peak pressure. The final stance (“Fate’s design had been a lock; he’d just picked it”) is earned but doesn’t fully register a personal cost beyond risk.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation (isolated by a curse, driven to outwit fear) is clear and her key choice—standing still and “welcoming” the horror—is credibly earned by what we know of her and the cloak. Interiority is present but could push deeper into contradiction; she mostly feels generically afraid rather than uniquely herself under pressure. Vey is sharply sketched as an advisor with his own agenda, though his inner stake remains underdeveloped. The final exchange on “what truth do you serve?” hints at richer dynamics that the story doesn’t quite have room to fully dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward is vivid and particular—her history with the mallet, her tide-prophet practice, and her mantra about obstacles all feel grounded and specific. Motivation is clear and consistently enacted as she rebuilds and re-tunes the shattered circle. What’s thinner is internal contradiction: she rarely hesitates or missteps, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The final satisfaction is earned but emotionally modest, more craft-triumph than a hard-won internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira is clearly motivated by her mother’s disappearance and obsessive curiosity, and her key choices (digging into the crack, descending, reading the journal, standing her ground) all track. Her emotional responses are embodied and specific, but her internal conflict—knowledge vs. safety, self vs. city—stays more implied than fully dramatized. The “quietly driven” aspect reads, but we don’t quite see a visible, costly renunciation tied to her flaw by the end. Secondary figures (the mother, elders, watchers) function more as forces than as characterized presences, which fits the length but limits relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s professional drive and skepticism are clear and consistent, and her decision to trust Tomas enough to enter the tunnel feels motivated rather than convenient. However, her internal conflict—between exposing lies and understanding why they were told—never fully bites; she registers the twist intellectually more than emotionally. Tomas is intriguingly economical but still a bit like a wise guide archetype rather than a fully pressured person. The final shift to “gardener of memory” is earned conceptually but doesn’t show much visible personal cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, legacy from her grandmother, and mix of pragmatism and yearning are cleanly established and stay consistent. Her interiority feels particular (the inkwell, the idea of “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) rather than generic, and her curiosity drives every turn. The shift from treating her grandmother’s phrase as metaphor to confronting its literal trace is a credible, modest evolution. The main limitation is that her stoicism/sensitivity conflict never forces a difficult or costly choice; her path through the discovery remains relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation—to uncover the city’s true history—is clear, coherent, and carries through to her final choice to share the journal. Her methodical, analytical mindset is shown through concrete actions (sketching the grooves, testing the stamp) rather than labels alone. However, internal conflict is relatively muted; curiosity reliably trumps fear, so we rarely see genuinely competing impulses in tension on the page. The change at the end (from archivist to bearer of uncomfortable truth) is credible but shaded more as affirmation than as an agonized or costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lantern maker’s grief, craft, and determination are sharply drawn, with concrete traits (trembling fingers, “polish until the stone weeps”) that individualize her. Her motivation—to reclaim and reframe her brother’s loss—is clear and consistently drives choices, including confronting the shadow instead of fleeing. Internal contradiction shows in her simultaneous ache and hope (laughing “brittle as winter ice” even as she creates beauty). The only limitation is that we glimpse almost no genuine risk she might fail or regress, so the final stance feels a touch inevitable rather than precariously won.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she’s driven by grief and the need to “awaken” via unused potential—and her choices (refusing to abort, entering the node, discarding the observatory device) track well. Interiority is vivid and character-specific, with embodied emotion (“edges biting into her palm,” “a sound like shattered glass”). Internal contradiction (trauma-driven recklessness vs. awareness of risk) is present but could be more sharply dramatized in a concrete dilemma rather than primarily via defiant lines. The final shift from survivor to “seer, disrupter” feels earned but slightly schematic in language, sanding off some messy ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivations (job vs. real mission) are clear and consistent, and her professional competence is well-drawn through her interaction with the drone and tools. Emotional interiority is present but fairly light: she’s curious and surprised, but rarely conflicted in a way that alters her choices. The pilgrim is more symbolic than individuated, which suits the piece but limits relational complexity. The final shift to “Now we listen” feels earned but carries little visible cost or deep internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt, professional cynicism, and emerging conscience are clear and specific, and his bodily responses (watch, ribs, breath) ground his inner state. His occupation meaningfully shapes his moral bind about Lila. However, his final decision to tell the truth arrives a bit swiftly, with limited on-page friction between competing impulses in that moment. The relationship to Lila remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a live interaction, which slightly blunts the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is specific and consistent—her early arrival, tactile relationship with the drawer pull, and attention to prisoners’ families all feel grounded in a particular psyche. Her motivation (atoning for a past failed exchange, “recycling mistakes into wisdom”) is clear and threads through the story to the moment she lets the pull go. However, we mostly see her competence and composure; contradictory impulses under live pressure are muted because the present-tense exchange never truly strains her. Elias is sketched effectively but remains largely a foil rather than a developed crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s motivation—to test whether she can live by her own choices rather than others’ expectations—is clear, coherent, and present in every beat. Her flaws (avoidance, clinging to safety while romanticizing risk) are specific and drive the conflict. The final renunciation of the compass and “I’m done hiding” feel earned by prior interior struggle. A minor weakness is the slight reliance on abstracted self-knowledge rather than fully embodied contradictory impulses in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s core makeup—ex-corporate spy, reset, haunted by phantom guilt—is vivid and coherently drives her present choices. Her decision to follow the baseball’s lead into the lake feels motivated by that mix of calculation and yearning, and the mosaic of possible lives concretizes her inner conflict. However, her emotions are sometimes summarized (“something akin to hope”) rather than fully embodied in specific, character-particular ways. J.T. works more as an articulated theme vector than as a fully realized counter-character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s fear, duty, and isolation are rendered with rich interiority and clear contradiction—her desire to cling to humanity even as she yields to transformation feels specific and embodied (“her throat tighten,” the insect-crawl of changing skin). Her motivation to reforge the bond is clear and consistent, and her eventual acceptance of metamorphosis is credibly earned. The main limitation is that her flaws and blind spots remain somewhat generalized (reluctant chosen-one, isolated outsider) rather than idiosyncratically hers. The relationship with the phoenix is mostly abstracted as “bond” and “presence,” so the emotional cost of changing that relationship could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief, guilt, and hunger for restitution are clear and consistently rooted in her history with her mother and the absent handprint ritual. Her interiority is vivid and particular (“air tasted of ozone and old starlight”), and her actions—coming to the glade, using the cards and saucer—align with a believable need to reconfigure that loss. The shift from seeking “prophecy” to “penance” and finally to acceptance feels earned, though her internal conflict could be sharpened with one concrete, resisted alternative (e.g., refusing the vision, leaving the saucer untouched). Emotional embodiment is strong, if sometimes voiced in slightly abstract, lyrical terms rather than fully contradictory impulses in the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s pacifism, avoidance of conflict, and eventual willingness to engage are clearly motivated and consistent, and her internal contradiction (peace as avoidance vs peace as courage) is cleanly framed. However, the shadow work itself feels abbreviated and largely summarized (“She closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her”), so her breakthrough borders on too frictionless. Embodied struggle with her darker impulses is hinted at more than dramatized, softening the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira is clearly motivated—her destitute philanthropy, obsession with “the texture of transformation,” and receptivity to the strange letter align with her choices at the beach. The encounter with the scarred man exposes a convincing internal tension between “fixing” and true transformation, but that conflict resolves a bit too smoothly with limited on-page struggle. Her actions (releasing the bugs, choosing to listen) are consistent and specific, yet her flaws and blind spots could be dramatized more sharply under pressure. The fire-scarred man is vivid but mostly a thematic mouthpiece rather than a fully pressured counter-presence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kieran’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his profession and habits (watching the sundial, keeping the quill holder) nicely reveal character. However, his interiority remains fairly straightforward—there’s little contradictory impulse or felt risk once the opportunity appears. Elara is sketched efficiently but leans functional, with limited sense of deeper flaws or tension between them. The final choice to descend feels aligned but not costly, so the emotional arc, while coherent, is not especially rich.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation—to restore sacred order and understand the patterns—remains clear and consistent, and her micro-choices with the rocks under pressure track well with that drive. Her fear of catastrophic futures versus her longing to fulfill her mother’s promise yields credible internal tension. However, her emotional landscape leans abstract (a lot of “promise,” “curse,” “sacred order”) and could use one or two more concrete, idiosyncratic details to feel fully particular rather than archetypal. The final acceptance—shifting from control to witnessing—reads earned but a little too smooth, with limited visible cost beyond brief terror.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s internal life is vivid and specific: the censored poet who hides behind a literal mask yet longs to expose his scars through language. His motivations (evading the Ministry, needing to “rarefy” his poetry) are clear and organically tied to his history and environment. The internal conflict—self-protective concealment vs. dangerous honesty—plays through concrete objects (mask, envelope, timer) and culminates in the decision to mail the poem. The only limit at this length is that his flaws and contradictions, while present, aren’t pushed into truly messy moral territory.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael and Elyra are sharply etched and their dynamic is clear—status shifts convincingly from rivalry to collaboration, and the line “I evolve” feels earned by prior beats. Motivation is coherent (they duel to test philosophies and decode the card), and Elyra’s blend of aggression and curiosity plays well. However, interior contradiction is stated more through clever dialogue than embodied conflict; we rarely feel their nerves, fear, or genuine risk beyond one grazed shoulder. The emotional cost of choosing collaboration over victory is underplayed, which limits the depth of their change.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cedar is vivid, specific, and internally conflicted: the molting selves, the tin, and his compulsion to “rebuild” all integrate into credible motivation. His micro-choices (returning to the library, showing Marla the tin, accepting the new poem’s thesis) track cleanly with that psychology. Marla is sketched efficiently but with real texture (retired boxer, imprisoned guard, distant daughter), and the status dynamic between them is legible. The only limitation is that Cedar’s final reframing (“maybe the answer wasn’t to rebuild but to grow through the chaos”) comes a bit neatly as an insight, with less on-page struggle in the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is specific and textured—her avoidance of fixing the clock, her fixation on the compasses, and her relationship to improvisation all feel lived-in. Her core contradiction (strategic planner vs. paralyzed escapee who only truly acts at the piano) is present but could be sharpened under pressure. The final stance—choosing to play in defiance of “fate”—is motivated by prior beats, though the cost of that choice is more implied than dramatized. Overall she reads distinct and coherent, but not yet at a level of searing, conflicted complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s function and motivation are clear from the outset, and her role as “reality checker” feels specific rather than generic. The internal conflict around whether collective memory is worth preserving is a strong beat, especially when the island tests her with doubt. However, the doubt resolves quickly and cleanly, with limited messiness or lingering cost, which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. Her emotional life is evocative but a bit archetypal, more emblematic guardian than idiosyncratic person.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivations are clear—Yorick’s patient guidance and Lira’s need for closure track cleanly through each beat—but interiority is fairly light and the mutual forgiveness feels a bit tidy given the years of estrangement. Yorick’s worldview comes through in bonsai metaphors and careful speech, giving him specificity. Lira’s emotional state is more generic; we see her urgency, less so her contradictory impulses. The final peace lands, but with limited sense of what it costs either of them beyond articulated regret.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal shift is summarized ("kindled a humility") rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices. The transition from arrogance to humility feels inevitable and smooth rather than earned through resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lirael’s primary trait (“steadily adaptive”) is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through a difficult, constrained choice. Her motivation is abstract (“discover purpose”), and while her internal state is described, the survival backstory creates no immediate physical or tactical impediment in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael’s motivation is explained via summary ("motivation was personal") rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the present. She faces no interpersonal friction; Elias accepts her work immediately, denying her a crucible for character growth or defined interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation relies heavily on a dream sequence rather than character agency, undercutting the protagonist's established skepticism. The "stubborn" trait is stated as a label but immediately contradicted by his swift compliance, failing to constrain his choices or generate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira functions as a competent vehicle for the theme rather than a deeply realized character. She lacks internal contradiction or significant doubt, and her decisions encounter no meaningful emotional friction or personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.3)
    Lira is defined by labels ("spiritually curious," "pilgrim of sparks") rather than embodied traits or contradictions. Her internal landscape consists of abstract concepts ("revealing what was hidden," "healing") rather than specific human desires or fears. There is no internal conflict; she moves from curiosity to enlightenment without resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elara functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a fully realized character; her motivation ("texture of time") is abstract and philosophical rather than visceral. The final realization feels told rather than earned through difficult choice, as she observes the magic rather than driving the outcome through character-specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist's capabilities are inconsistent; she possesses the strength to snap iron cuffs effortlessly at the climax, which renders her earlier captivity and "patient waiting" illogical. Her motivation relies on abstract labels ("liberator," "promise") rather than grounded, embodied desire, and her internal state is delivered through melodramatic telling.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is laser-focused and drives the narrative logic; her synesthetic condition is not just a trait but the engine of the plot. The emotional arc from seeking betrayal to accepting absence is legible, though the specific desire for "trust breaking" feels slightly abstract until anchored by the father’s backstory. The internal conflict is resolved through a decisive physical action with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara functions as a genre archetype rather than a specific individual; her defining trait ("quietly savvy") is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through clever improvisation under pressure. The emotional climax—sacrificing the photo—lacks felt cost because the magic immediately upgrades the offering, negating the sense of loss essential to the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization feels driven by prompt instructions rather than organic psychology; the "dramatic narration" reads as a performed quirk rather than a genuine trait. The emotional arc resolves too tidily, with internal conflicts settled by convenient epiphanies rather than pressure-tested choices.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on "telling" rather than dramatization; Lila's phobias are described as "genetic hand-me-downs" but vanish instantly during the climax without earned internal struggle. The mother-daughter dynamic is reduced to expository dialogue about their roles ("I was afraid to love you") rather than embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mara functions more as a ritual vessel than a fully realized character; her motivation is driven by destiny ("knew the time had come") rather than personal agency. The attribute "mildly obsessed" appears twice as a diagnostic label that clashes with the mythic tone and fails to drive specific, costly choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is consistent but largely passive, observing the violin’s effects rather than driving the plot through difficult choices. The emotional arc from logic to &quot;joy&quot; is stated rather than dramatized, and the &quot;composed&quot; trait flattens potential internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined by static labels ("meticulous," "quiet") rather than choices under pressure. His transition from a registrar of facts to a mystic artist is instantaneous and frictionless, lacking the internal resistance or psychological cost required to make the arc earned. The "mistrust" mentioned is diagnosed by the narrator rather than demonstrated through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is a consistent but static archetype (the wise mentor) who faces no internal conflict or doubt. While her motivation is clear, she functions more as a delivery system for the theme than a character making difficult choices under pressure; Joren’s instant conversion lacks friction or earned character development.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Veyra acts as a functional operator rather than a character with internal conflict; "obliging" is a label rather than a driver of choice. The "curiosity" awakened at the end is stated in exposition rather than earned through a high-stakes struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.0)
    Clara’s motivation shifts abruptly from vague inspiration to a life-defining vow to "prove the ghost’s existence," relying on off-page skeptics to generate stakes. While her internal state is consistent, her emotional progression feels linear and slightly convenient, lacking the contradiction or resistance required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirael’s interiority is distinct, blending technical jargon with intuition, but the inciting shift from logic to feeling relies heavily on the "fever" backstory rather than on-page pressure. The antagonist (Director) is a static foil who speaks in thematic setup lines ("Oracles don’t feel... they quantify"), reducing the complexity of the interpersonal dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined by labels ("religiously skeptical") that dissolve immediately upon contact with the plot; he accepts the supernatural voice and hologram without the internal resistance a skeptic would manifest. His "science meets superstition" methodology feels like a contrived quirk rather than a grounded character trait, and his motivation shifts from appraisal to passive witness without a clear decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear but stated through diagnostic interiority ("judgment tainted every observation") rather than demonstrated through specific, costly interactions. The attribute "grip on reality loosening" functions as a label rather than a source of erratic behavior or error that complicates the journey, resulting in a character who feels more like a vessel for the theme than a distinct individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on assigned labels ("mellow patience," "skepticism") rather than demonstrated complexity. Mara's transformation is unearned by interpersonal pressure, pivoting instead on a magical prop that bypasses genuine psychological resistance or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias functions as a generic archetype ("odd historian") rather than a specific individual; his motivation is stated ("simple: to collect") rather than felt through struggle. There is no internal contradiction or meaningful cost to his actions; he observes and translates but does not face a character-defining choice. The "sensitive" trait is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    A central contradiction undermines the protagonist's agency: she is introduced as a "maestro" orchestrating fate, yet the twist reveals she was unaware her fortunes were codes ("dismissed as harmless"). This inconsistency makes her competence and motivation incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a living character; motivation is told ("not to destroy but to illuminate") rather than demonstrated through struggle. Internal conflict is absent, and the climax lacks emotional cost, as the priest simply executes a plan without facing a dilemma or personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lirael's motivation is clearly stated, but her internal struggle remains abstract, defined by labels ("chronological homesickness") rather than dramatized behavioral constraints. The lack of contradictory impulses or a difficult choice under pressure makes her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.4)
    Motivation is explicitly told ("simple, yet profound") rather than dramatized through friction or specific desire. The internal conflict is binary and resolved by a summary decision ("She chose the right path") without enacted struggle or embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("Emotional numbness, the doctors called it") rather than embodied struggle. Her immediate healing upon using the wire removes the necessary internal conflict or resistance, reducing her to a passive vessel for the prompt's magical solution.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation shifts abruptly from isolationism to whistleblowing based on a single message, lacking sufficient internal struggle or on-page development. Character traits are delivered via prompt-word labels ("nurture integrity," "credibly curious") rather than demonstrated through complex action. The antagonist is abstract, leaving Elias to operate without genuine interpersonal pressure or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's transition from "aromatically cautious" to embracing grief is driven by a vision rather than a high-stakes micro-choice. The resolution is intellectualized and immediate, lacking the embodied struggle or contradictory impulses required for a higher score. Motivation is stated ("needed answers") rather than dramatized through escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kael functions as a thematic vessel; the attribute "ethically playful" acts as a jarring label for a laugh rather than a behavior constraint. Motivation is externally defined by the entity's dialogue rather than emerging from grounded internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira lacks internal contradiction or genuine flaws; she functions as a competent thematic vehicle rather than a struggling protagonist. Her emotional arc is frictionless, moving from intention to perfect execution without doubt, mistake, or embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Elias faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice; he simply fulfills a request, making him a functional functionary rather than a protagonist. Lira is a stock "weary client" prop who accepts a life-altering trade-off without credible hesitation or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Clara’s reaction to the inciting mystery—finding a letter in her own handwriting that she didn't write—is puzzlingly mild (mere curiosity), breaking psychological verisimilitude. Her transition from a "shrewd broker" to a benevolent forger feels unearned, as the "shrewdness" is told but not dramatized in the pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's defining trait ("boldly sympathetic") is assigned as a label rather than dramatized through costly action or choice. Motivation is delivered via exposition ("to graft himself onto community") rather than emerging from scene pressure. Internal states rely on abstract, poetic descriptions ("luminescent ache") instead of embodied emotion, resulting in a character who feels like a vessel for the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character motivation is functional but lacks depth; Lila is guided by the voice rather than difficult internal choices. The inciting reaction ("curiosity overpowering fear") and the pivotal decision ("Without thinking") reduce agency and bypass genuine struggle. Interiority relies on summary phrases like "Lila's mind raced" rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("mathematics of emotion," "loss... ambiguous, gnawing sort") rather than embodied reaction. The brother functions more as a thematic delivery system than a character, particularly in the memory where he articulates the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("Mara’s kindly nature emerged," "methodical mind") rather than dramatized choice. The protagonist lacks internal conflict; her shift from wanting invisibility to becoming a "visible guardian" is instant and frictionless, lacking the necessary struggle or cost to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor’s transformation is abrupt and lacks credible internal resistance; decades of scientific control are overturned by a single observation without struggle. The "circuitously sincere" attribute is applied to a tree rather than dramatized as a character trait, and her emotional arc resolves too neatly through convenient external validation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is stated clearly ("threshing meaning"), but agency is low; the protagonist resolves her internal conflict by accepting a magical gift rather than making a difficult choice or sacrifice. The trait "wryly earnest" is applied as a label twice rather than demonstrated through behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara's characterization is functional, with clear motivation established early. However, her pivotal decision to accept the pearl feels slightly rushed, lacking sufficient internal resistance given her established caution. The pilgrim serves more as a thematic device than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lirael functions as a plot device rather than a character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal stakes. Her success is guaranteed by the narrative rather than earned through difficult choices or risk. There is no emotional cost or genuine struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is defined by labels (&quot;meticulous nature,&quot; &quot;analytical mind,&quot; &quot;artistic side&quot;) rather than dramatized choices that prove these traits under pressure. The internal conflict is summarized in narration, and his interaction with the guide lacks friction; he simply accepts the ticket without a moment of doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    Skepticism serves as a label rather than a trait that resists the plot; Clara abandons her worldview immediately upon finding the artifact, removing potential internal conflict. Motivation remains abstract ("sculpt space"), and the emotional arc lacks the friction of genuine choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael’s transition from ennui to fear is stated ("rare sensation") rather than dramatized through behavior. Lira functions primarily as an exposition device ("I am Lira... we’ve been trapped here"), lacking independent agency or distinct voice. The emotional pivot at the climax relies on a convenient mirror reflection to externalize the stakes rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions primarily as a delivery mechanism for the prompt's props rather than a fully realized character. The resolution relies on the magical properties of the ink pot ("tasted it... saw the agents' thoughts") rather than her specific skills or "honest" nature, undermining her agency. Her internal conflict is stated ("knew better than to trust appearances") but not dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies on label-only descriptions ("earnestly studious") rather than choices under pressure. Althea lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; her actions are linear and face no resistance, resulting in a static portrait rather than a dramatized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)
    The character arc is circular and contradictory. In the first paragraph, the protagonist explicitly "knew better" than the death certificate, yet the climax treats the realization that he is Marcus Hale as a shocking epiphany ("hit like a tidal wave"). This resets the character's internal state to the beginning without genuine progression. The motivation to find "them" appears abruptly at the end without prior buildup of a specific antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s designation as a "myth buster" is discarded immediately; she accepts the magical premise without the skepticism her role implies, erasing potential internal conflict. The shift from logic to empathy is asserted as a realization rather than earned through a pressured choice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira functions as a plot device whose "orderly intuition" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. Her internal conflict ("dual allegiance") resolves without personal cost, as she saves the carnival without sacrificing her standing or the chip.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira is consistent and her motivation is clear, but she functions largely as a vessel for the story's sentimental theme rather than a complex agent. Her interiority often relies on summary ("curiosity wasn't bound by duty," "Lira knew the truth") rather than dramatized, conflicted choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira lacks internal conflict and her primary obstacle is resolved by the mentor's instruction rather than her own ingenuity or sacrifice. The descriptor "heartfelt artisan" acts as a label rather than a demonstrated trait, and her emotional arc is a flat line of competence without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("subtly confident," "knowing") rather than dramatized traits. Clara’s motivation is stated philosophically but lacks visceral grounding; her internal struggle is minimal, as she overcomes the central obstacle with ease and a magical phrasebook.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.4)
    Kael functions as a competent archetype rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal contradiction, doubts, or a personal cost that would make his patience and success feel earned through struggle rather than inherent virtue.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara acts with clear agency, but her primary motivation ("harness the ephemeral") feels abstract and declared rather than viscerally demonstrated. The connection to her specific backstory ("crown she'd never worn") is tantalizing but underutilized, leaving the emotional stakes slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a vessel for metaphor rather than a psychological agent. His motivation ("chase the hush") remains abstract, and his internal conflict is resolved via a sudden, unearned realization ("He understood then").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation is explicitly stated via exposition ("Lira’s motivation was to...") rather than dramatized through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear but lacks internal friction; her doubt is stated ("didn't fully believe") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "warmly curious" attribute appears as a label rather than a driver of behavior that costs her something in the face of danger. Her emotional journey is linear, smoothing over the conflict between skepticism and faith without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira is largely a passive vehicle for the plot; she follows instructions from the clipboard ("Meaning discovered") and the letter without making difficult choices. Her motivation shifts from personal curiosity to inheriting a legacy, but this transition relies on a convenient hologram reveal rather than internal struggle or agency. The emotional beats, such as the trembling fingers and tears, feel standard rather than specific to her character's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    Zara functions as a static "Wise Mentor" archetype, with traits like "disguising wisdom" stated in narration rather than dramatized through deceptive behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)

The lack of genuine flaws or blind spots makes her success feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marisol's motivation is clear, but her primary trait ("methodically playful") is established through repetitive labeling rather than distinct high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype rather than a nuanced character; his success is immediate and lacks internal friction or doubt. The "spark of defiance" is stated as motivation but does not force a difficult choice or sacrifice on the page. He faces no genuine psychological pressure, resulting in a flat trajectory where he simply executes skills without personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira functions as an archetypal vessel for the aesthetic rather than a fully realized character; her motivation ("photosynthesize pain") is abstract and her actions are passive reactions to magical events.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael's transition from solitary caretaker to collaborator is legible, but her internal struggle is brief. The final emotion ("foxglove regret") feels like an inserted label rather than an embodied feeling earned by the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.7)
    Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices; the protagonist succeeds at every task with "reckless precision" rather than struggle. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("mind like a labyrinth") and explicit diagnostic realization ("dammed her own river").

    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("slyly heartfelt nature") rather than embodied action or choice. Lira lacks genuine internal conflict; her "struggle" to harmonize values is stated as a goal but executed as a linear procedural task without hesitation or error. The emotional arc feels performed ("trembled... from the thrill") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined by backstory summary rather than on-page friction. The shift from cautious smuggler to reckless adventurer occurs via a montage ("Weeks passed") and a dream, rather than a dramatized pressure point, leaving his motivation feeling convenient rather than earned. The internal conflict is stated ("truth gnawed at him") but not proven through a difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lira’s internal landscape relies on abstract labels ("resolve," "intuition") rather than embodied struggle, creating a distance from her emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara acts as a passive observer rather than an agent of change; her interiority relies on abstract labels ("rhythm," "belonging") rather than contradictory impulses.

The emotional arc is linear and resolved without internal cost or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira functions as a vehicle for the premise rather than a fully embodied character; her defining trait ("cheerful gloom") is assigned via label rather than dramatized through complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her "analytical" nature is a label rather than a source of friction. The interaction with the teen is purely functional validation, and she pays no emotional or physical cost for her success, leaving her arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and consistent, driven by a palpable need for renewal. However, her internal landscape relies heavily on labeled emotions ("ached," "hollow," "defiance") rather than dramatized psychological struggle. The "nostalgia ban" provides context but feels more like a premise wrapper than a pressure forcing complex character choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara lacks internal contradiction, agency, or genuine struggle; she functions as a passive observer rather than a protagonist under pressure. The narrative offers no "cost" for her realization, resulting in a static character arc where she simply arrives, sees beauty, and leaves satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is delivered through summary and explicit labels ("bargained his innocence," "responsibility") rather than embodied desire.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear (grief), but her internal arc is static; she begins with a goal and achieves it through endurance without facing a contradictory impulse or moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara functions as a professional archetype rather than a specific individual under pressure; her internal state is largely static and conveyed through abstract reflection rather than contradictory impulses. The "cost" of redemption is intellectualized in thought ("she mused") rather than felt through a difficult on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central contradiction (amoral destroyer vs. sentimental preserver) is compelling and drives the ritual. The philanthropist's swift pivot back to the "luxury resort" project effectively deepens the character's complexity at the end. However, the internal monologue occasionally relies on summarized sentiment ("secret sentimentality") rather than fully embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is clearly defined, but his transition from exploitative eulogist to subversive puppeteer is summarized rather than felt. The trait "urbane calligrapher" colors the narration ("ink-stained fingers") but doesn't deeply constrain his tactical choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is well-rendered, particularly the translation of his casting skills to the rope, but the "forgiveness" arc is resolved in backstory. This leaves him without an active internal struggle in the scene, resulting in a linear path to success without a testing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("foresight was matched only by her hindsight," "precisely playful") rather than demonstrated traits.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her transformation from skeptic to believer relies on the external validation of the voice rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is asserted through abstract summary ("bridge generational wisdom") rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices.

Lira faces no internal opposition; her competence is absolute, reducing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elara is defined primarily by her role and the summary trait "simply complicated," which is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices.

The emotional arc is linear and lacks the friction of genuine ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara is a competent protagonist with a clear professional drive, but her shift from relying on expertise to "admitting ignorance" feels thematic rather than deeply character-driven. The attribute "carefully resourceful" is inserted as a static label rather than dramatized through high-pressure ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Mapkeeper is a capable, consistent protagonist who functions effectively as a vehicle for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lirael’s internal arc is clear but intellectualized; the shift from observer to participant relies on diagnostic telling ("sculpt her own identity") rather than dramatized struggle. The lack of contradictory impulses in the scene makes the emotional resolution feel too tidy and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.3)
    The backstory of "three children scarred" establishes a gravity that the tidy resolution—lighting a flower and laughing—fails to match, making the redemption arc feel unearned. Lira's internal landscape is described rather than dramatized through difficult choices, leaving her transformation hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara lacks genuine internal conflict or flaws; she appears perfectly wise, resolving the situation without struggle or personal cost.

Kael serves merely as a foil to be enlightened, resulting in a dynamic lacking distinct status shifts or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.3)
    Lila acts as a vessel for the prompt’s whimsy ("collect flavors of silences") rather than possessing a grounded, survival-tier motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s traits ("virtuously mischievous," "spotting lies") are declared via exposition rather than demonstrated through complex decision-making. Her pivotal action—turning the bolt—is a compliance move dictated by the device and voices, rather than an internal triumph of her specific background.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael functions as a passive observer of her own story; she turns a crank, watches a vision, and reads a letter that explains the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira is defined largely by labels ("lost soul collector," "modestly fearless") and abstract internal monologue rather than specific, contradictory behavior.

The character feels like a vessel for the prompt's concepts rather than a lived-in presence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is clearly defined, but his agency is undercut by the arrival of the woman, who functions as a guide figure delivering the story’s epiphany rather than him earning it through struggle. The "proprioceptive enhancements" provide flavor but don't drive distinct tactical choices beyond basic balance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.4)
    Lira lacks agency; she functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s instructions rather than a driver of action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias functions primarily as a diagnostic tool rather than a fully realized character; his lack of internal conflict or personal stakes reduces him to a "magical guide" archetype.

The interaction relies heavily on Elias explaining Lira’s own internal state to her, which flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira is a consistent focalizer with a unique vocation, but her internal landscape lacks the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara is a distinct, functional protagonist with a clear retrocognitive burden that shapes the plot.

    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling rather than dramatized behavior; the protagonist's motivation is "etched into her bones" (telling) rather than shown through struggle.

    Lira’s transition from uncertainty to the suicidal gesture of removing her mask feels unearned by the preceding beats; it reads as a theatrical "movie moment" rather than a grounded psychological shift. The epiphany ("mending her") relies on stock flashbacks (quilts, shattered flask) rather than specific, pressurized interaction with the statue. The realization is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias functions more as an archetype of the "nostalgic painter" than a specific individual; his motivation relies on superstition (cracked mirror) rather than internal agency. The conflicting promises—breaking a vow to never visit the cave in order to keep a vow to find beauty—create a muddled causal chain that feels convenient rather than conflicted. The emotional arc resolves through a magical encounter rather than character effort or realization.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s internal motivation is clear and poignant, but the conflict with Thalos resolves too easily, depriving the relationship of genuine friction or status dynamics. The "mad urge" is stated rather than fully dramatized through difficult choices, and Thalos shifts from obstacle to mentor with convenient speed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara serves primarily as a functional vessel for the ritual, obeying instructions without internal conflict or hesitation. Her motivation is abstract ("geography of loss") and explicitly stated rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character traits are established through labels ("rational," "methodical") and explicit exposition rather than emerging organically from complex choices. The interaction with Jorn is functional but relies on diagnostic dialogue to explain the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is defined chiefly by eccentric costume ("nest of silver and seaweed") rather than active choices under pressure. His motivation to investigate is stated ("investigate," "focus was sharper") rather than earned through a personal stake that resists the plot's ease. The "eccentricity" feels like a standard trope rather than a specific, lived-in personality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lila is defined by stock traits ("wire-rimmed glasses," "lonely") rather than embodied contradiction. The climax relies on a vision where a secondary character explains her internal state ("You're not lost") rather than her demonstrating a shift through a high-cost choice. The emotional resolution feels unearned, as the epiphany is delivered via spectral therapy rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's central realization is delivered via diagnostic monologue by a secondary entity rather than earned through action or choice. The figure explicitly lists her internal states ("You are afraid to rule..."), reducing her agency to passive acceptance. This "therapy-speak" externalizes the internal conflict, robbing the character of a genuine epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies on summary labels like "scientifically romantic" rather than embodied traits. The protagonist does not solve the problem through resilience or ingenuity; instead, the solution is handed to her by the companion, reducing her agency in the critical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.3)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic labeling ("feral nostalgia," "chronologically confused") rather than embodied experience. The physical struggle of the climb is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing the felt cost of the choice. Internal conflict is resolved through abstract realization rather than pressure-tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s insight feels less like character capability and more like narrative convenience; the leap to identifying the daughter relies on a convenient prop (the file) rather than genuine character insight. Her internal monologue leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("emotional terrain") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but his internal arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from trembling fear to "shedding lies" feels like a scripted pivot rather than a hard-won psychological victory. He lacks the contradictory impulses or behavioral flaws under pressure that would make him feel like a distinct individual rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clara’s “gossip-column exorcist” persona is a compelling hook that establishes immediate, specific competence. However, her sudden pivot to the pseudo-scientific explanation of the bottle ("copper conducts electricity") feels less like character voice and more like an authorial device to bridge a plot gap. Elias functions adequately as a client, though his "eyes two bruises" description leans into stock moody-musician tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.3)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined by abstract labels ("weight of a thousand lifetimes") rather than specific, embodied traits. Internal conflict is summarized as "battles between doubt and certainty" rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices or behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lorn is a distinct, cohesive focalizer with a clear lineage and role that ground the fable-like tone. While his interiority is vivid, his agency is primarily observational and ritualistic; the final realization feels more like an inevitable epiphany than the result of a high-stakes, costly decision made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on stated traits ("private obsession," "familiar strangers") rather than dramatized behavior. Kael's internal arc—from analyst to "letting go"—is resolved instantly without genuine struggle or psychological cost. The emotional turning point is melodramatic ("breath hitched") rather than earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s grief is palpable and motivates the journey, but the "compulsive gambler" trait feels more like a backstory label than an active pressure shaping the climax; she resolves the final beat through logic/memory rather than a high-stakes wager. The internal contradiction is stated ("theoretical rebellion") but not fully dramatized in the micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara serves as a benevolent functional device rather than a conflicted protagonist; her internal state is described via abstract labels ("cultivated estrangement") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. The "flicker of purpose" feels asserted rather than earned by overcoming genuine internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the concept than a dynamic agent; her interiority relies on summary ("She believed," "She imagined") rather than active struggle. The emotional state is described via labels ("haunted euphoria") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on descriptor labels ("elusive," "desperately jocular") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. The emotional arc resolves too cleanly via the ghost's intervention, bypassing the necessary internal struggle or cost associated with the protagonist's "debts."

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias is a passive protagonist who follows instructions from magical objects rather than making difficult choices. His interiority relies on abstract labels ("grief," "hope," "true purpose") rather than embodied emotion or contradiction. There is no visible cost to his actions; he simply obeys the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated by guilt, but his arc is reactive; he relies entirely on Lira to explain the moral lesson and the mechanics of resolution. The internal conflict—the urge to fix versus the need to accept—is resolved through instruction rather than a pressure-tested choice or failure in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characters function as thematic ciphers rather than realized individuals. Kael’s internal state is described with abstract labels ("joyful sorrow," "silence becomes a prison") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or contradictions. There is no friction in the interactions; Lira and the crowd comply instantly, leaving the protagonist with no meaningful resistance to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.4)
    Mara is defined by diagnostic labels ("analytically intuitive") and a stated role ("arsonist") rather than contradictory impulses or choices under pressure. Her interiority is summarized rather than embodied, making her a vehicle for the plot rather than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("quietly rebellious," "patchwork of... scars") and metaphors rather than demonstrated traits. The emotional arc from numbness to "thriving" is unearned, pivoting instantly on an external character's instruction rather than internal struggle or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype rather than a distinct individual; his journey lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The motivation to prove "whispers travel farther" is explicitly stated, but the climax relies on finding a magical key rather than a difficult choice or the specific application of his theory against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira serves as a static vessel for the prompt’s abstract motivation ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than a character with grounded desires or internal conflict. Her "silence" functions as a label rather than a tactic tested by pressure; the interaction with the fisherman is dismissed without cost or character revelation. The narrative relies on diagnostic statements ("Her attribute was spiralingly calm") instead of dramatized behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central mechanic (hearing "unspoken words") serves as a shortcut that labels emotions directly in italics (e.g., *I need to know how to win*) rather than dramatizing them through action or subtext. This constitutes "diagnostic label-speak," preventing genuine character depth or ambiguity. The emotional shift from isolation to learning occurs off-page during a summarized montage, making the growth feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira’s internal state is conveyed through labeled emotions ("anticipation," "calm") rather than embodied reaction or dilemma. The transition from reluctance to freedom is instantaneous and unearned by on-page struggle, functioning as a switch-flip rather than a character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lirael is defined by a singular note of defiant grief, rendering her somewhat static. While her interiority is consistent, her thoughts often read as thematic theses ("Lightness is not the absence...") rather than organic psychological processing. The "performance" aspect creates a barrier to genuine vulnerability, keeping the characterization slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lirael functions more as a vehicle for the magic system than a character with internal friction; her emotions are described via metaphor ("lantern-moth hush") rather than embodied visceral experience. The "tremor of certainty" removes the potential for doubt or struggle, resulting in a protagonist who faces no meaningful internal or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's acceptance of the antagonist's role in a devastating historical event ("scorching the sky") is rushed and lacks emotional verisimilitude, prioritizing an aesthetic realization over human consequence. The prompt-required attribute "innocently cunning" is inserted as a narrative label rather than dramatized through action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira is a vehicle for the prompt's themes rather than a character with embodied desire; her primary trait, "powerfully gentle," exists as a label rather than a tactical constraint tested by pressure. Internal conflict is absent, replaced by a linear execution of instructions, and the "choice" to question assumptions feels like a procedural step rather than a risky divergence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on summary and label-speak ("grief had hollowed him," "atonement") rather than embodied emotion. The emotional arc feels linear and predetermined, lacking the internal contradiction or resistance required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a static sage figure rather than a protagonist under pressure; she teaches but does not struggle or pay a cost. Motivation is abstract ("reverse engineering chaos") and lacks internal contradiction or emotional risk. Mara acts as a prompt-delivery device for the lecture rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is an archetype of the "rebel scholar" whose motivation is stated rather than felt through struggle. The antagonist, Kael, serves as a fragile straw man who exists only to voice objections and vanish, providing no genuine relational pressure or meaningful opposition. Lirael's internal state is described with abstract labels ("anguished joy") rather than embodied emotion, and she undergoes no significant internal change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lirael functions as a plot device to uncover clues rather than a character with agency; she follows instructions from the Elder and the footage without internal conflict. Her "deliberate" nature facilitates the plot mechanics but demands no personal cost or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s struggle is almost entirely internalized and resolved through abstract reflection rather than choice under pressure. Her emotions are frequently labeled ("ache of betrayal," "fear," "guilt") rather than dramatized through behavior that differs from her internal state. The epiphany feels inevitable rather than earned by a difficult tradeoff in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara’s motivation is explicitly stated ("She’d come here to find closure") rather than dramatized through conflicted action. The resolution relies on external validation—a vision of a happy future provided by the hourglass—rather than a choice that forces her to sacrifice or change through agency. The epiphany feels unearned, resting on a sudden shift in perspective gifted by the magic object.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions primarily as a vessel for exposition via visions rather than an agent making hard choices. Her emotional reactions rely on stock somatic phrases ("throat tightened," "tears pricking") rather than specific, embodied interiority. The "spatial imagination" trait is introduced as a label ("lattice of memories") but does not uniquely constrain her tactics or perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.5)
    Kael is a collection of romantic tropes ("moonstruck," "eyes like fractured galaxies") rather than a person with grounded interiority. His motivation is stated abstractly ("trapped creativity") and met without internal struggle or contradictory impulses. The resolution requires no difficult choice or renunciation; he simply receives a magical gift.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael is a distinct focalizer with a clear initial deficit (dreamlessness), but his rapid transformation from freight guard to quantum savior feels unearned. The internal pivot relies on a stated "ache" rather than a dramatized struggle or resistance, making his mastery of the archive's mechanics feel convenient rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is largely a vessel for observation rather than a driver of action; her motivation is abstract ("rediscover the wild frontier") and lacks urgency. At the climax, she becomes a passive observer—the gear levitates and detaches itself, robbing her of the decisive "letting go" choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lira and Jorin function as archetypes (Wise Mentor, Naive Apprentice) rather than specific individuals. Their dynamic lacks friction; Jorin’s doubts are mild prompts for Lira’s aphorisms rather than genuine internal conflict. The motivation ("find unused courage") remains abstract and symbolic, never grounding in a visceral, character-specific desire or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elric is a cypher whose motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through organic behavior. The pivotal internal shift relies on an unearned epiphany triggered by a stain, lacking psychological continuity. His transformation from silent observer to vocal sage feels like a functional requirement of the plot rather than a character-driven evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies on stock archetypes ("diminutive titan," "pretender") with no internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Veyra’s motivation is generic ("family’s legacy"), and she faces no moment of doubt or difficult choice that reveals character depth. The trait "regally unpretentious" is a told label rather than a demonstrated behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s internal obsession ("invisible cracks") is well-drawn, but Kael functions solely as a plot obstacle who capitulates instantly ("Nodded") without earned persuasion. The protagonist’s drive is clear, but the antagonist lacks the friction required to test her conviction meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.7)
    Characterization relies on telling via labels ("awkwardly confident") rather than behavior; Lira acts with unwavering prophetic certainty, contradicting the "awkward" tag. Jax’s conversion from skeptic to believer is instant and convenient, serving plot velocity rather than earned relationship dynamics. Diagnostic dialogue ("madness is just clarity") replaces genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies on expository summary ("insurgent grandmother") rather than behavior; the "telepathic" trait functions as a convenient plot device that eliminates investigative struggle rather than complicating the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("PTSD," "somatic choice," "fractured soul") rather than embodied experience. The emotional arc is linear and tidy, with the protagonist's transition from trauma to peace facilitated by a mentor figure's explicit validation rather than a messy, earned internal struggle. The prompt's "quietly talented" attribute appears as a label rather than a constraint that shapes behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation (escaping indifference, claustrophobia) drives the scene, and the shift from despair to agency is tracked. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on stated feelings ("crestfallen," "indifference") rather than subtextual interactions, and the transition to magical power feels slightly unearned by character psychology alone.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies on labeled emotions ("serene anger") rather than embodied reactions. The attribute "consciously wild intuition" feels mechanically inserted, resulting in a clunky character beat that lacks psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("bravely conflicted heart") rather than dramatized internal struggle. Kael functions as a prop, waking from century-long cryostasis with immediate cognitive clarity and no physiological cost, rendering the interaction artificial. The emotional arc is told through stock phrases ("trembled," "swallowed hard") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira is defined by labels ("pacifist," "bounty hunter's daughter") and abstract backstory rather than choices made under immediate pressure. Her internal monologue relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("understood the weight of silence"), and the central action—planting a scrap—is symbolic rather than a test of character with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael is a competent and active protagonist, but his "cool-headed" nature dampens the emotional stakes of the climax. His reaction to the goddess's dissolution is somewhat muted—"shoulders slumping" followed quickly by a "smile"—which makes the stated cost ("grief, longing") feel asserted rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clara's pivot from loyal daughter to whistleblower lacks sufficient internal friction; she encounters a "smoking gun" note that explicitly names her, which substitutes luck for genuine competence or struggle. The emotional cost is summarized in the aftermath rather than felt in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lira’s transition from tattooist to firmware engineer is unmotivated; her sudden technical knowledge ("tether the firmware") lacks groundwork in her established skill set. The emotional arc relies on stated backstory ("etched into her bones") and passive reaction rather than embodied behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara functions as a competent vehicle for the prompt's requirements rather than a distinct agent. The trait "socially perceptive" is applied awkwardly to an inanimate object to justify plot progression, and her motivation shifts mechanically from documentation to decoding without deep internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a static vessel for the story’s themes, defined by the label "gentle radical" rather than enacted personality. His motivation ("cradle empathy in arms of steel") is repeated as a slogan rather than dramatized through difficult choices. There is no internal contradiction or psychological cost; he begins and ends the scene with the same resolute mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a passive vehicle for description rather than a character defined by difficult choices or internal contradiction. His motivation is singular and lacks friction; he encounters no genuine resistance that tests his desire for an encore. The emotional arc is flat, moving from desire to satisfaction without a meaningful price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's internal motivation—trusting his somatic experience over corporate repair—is clear and drives the scene. However, the shared descriptor ("willowglass hope") applied to both Mara and Elias blurs their distinct voices and emotional separation. The resolution feels earned by time passed in summary rather than a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lira is a passive observer who succeeds without struggle; her emotions are reported via labels ("fear," "wonder") rather than embodied in action, and her final "resolve" lacks a dramatized alternative or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.1)
    Mara is defined by her title rather than specific traits or contradictions; her motivation is an abstract prompt phrase ("spin a prophecy") that generates no internal friction. She encounters no meaningful character-level obstacle, leading to a frictionless success without emotional or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mara's internal monologue relies on abstract metaphors ("hollow where her courage used to live") rather than grounded psychology. As a "burned spy," her competence is undermined by the central action—writing sensitive secrets in dirt that washes away—which feels like a genre violation rather than a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thaddeus is a static observer rather than an active protagonist; he perceives the world but faces no difficult choices, conflicting impulses, or internal struggle. His motivation is stated in abstract summary ("to distill complexity into essence") rather than dramatized through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s capability is well-established, and the backstory reveal effectively deepens her characterization, connecting her current "zen" state to past struggles. However, her present-timeline journey lacks internal friction or doubt; she functions more as a competent investigator than a protagonist under pressure. The "zen-minded" trait risks feeling like a protective shield that prevents immediate emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elias serves as a vehicle for the prompt's theme rather than a conflicted agent, with his motivation explicitly stated ("to reflect light") rather than dramatized through struggle. There is no internal contradiction or cost to his actions; he acts as a magical helper, and the "wistfully pragmatic" trait functions as a label rather than a lived behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.0)
    Motivation is declared ("to translate isolation into independence") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or internal contradiction. Lirael's transition from "contemporary of the dead" to "pioneer" is smooth and linear, missing the "brittleness" promised by the premise; she lacks the flaws or limits that create genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lila’s internal conflict is summarized ("hollow") rather than dramatized through friction or failed attempts. Her transformation is driven by a secondary character's guidance and a coincidental bird song rather than internal agency, making the emotional shift feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lila is a competent but static protagonist; she encounters a problem and solves it without internal contradiction or emotional cost. The repeated use of the prompt attribute ("cautiously hopeful") as a label rather than an enacted state flattens her interiority. There is no moment where her competence is tested by a genuine blind spot or flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("claustrophobia clawed," "prudently adventurous") rather than embodied, idiosyncratic reactions. The internal state is summarized via stock physical markers ("breath came in shallow bursts") rather than specific sensory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    Clara’s face blindness functions more as a mystical superpower than a grounded disability; her ability to "capture souls" and intuit a "plea for connection" from a ribbon feels unearned. Voss is a stock archetype (weary detective in a trench coat) serving only as a foil for exposition. The emotional beats, particularly the speech about empathy, rely on declared feeling rather than dramatized, embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    Character motivation is clear but relies on labeled traits ("nervously confident") rather than embodied complexity. The repetition of the specific phrase "nervously confident" flattens the characterization into a static tic rather than a developing state.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.7)
    Elias lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his actions are automatic (see flake -> play fiddle) without hesitation or struggle. The key attribute "dynamically observant" is explicitly labeled ("Elias was dynamically observant") rather than dramatized through a difficult discovery process, reducing character depth to a checklist item.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a static observer of his own summarized backstory; his "polished calm" is an asserted label rather than a trait tested by on-page pressure. Emotional states are named ("content," "peace") rather than embodied, and his motivation is resolved through a convenient, off-page victory without genuine internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lirael’s internal landscape is legible, and her motivation to find her brother is clear. However, her agency is dampened by Veyra, who arrives with the necessary tool (prism) and the explanation of the problem, reducing Lirael’s role to accepting the call rather than driving the discovery. The emotional arc from avoidance to acceptance feels rushed, resolving a lifelong fear of "other's pain" in a single beat without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is stated ("walls of thorns") rather than demonstrated through interaction. Crucially, her emotional resolution is outsourced to the magical spores; she does not actively process the trauma or make a difficult choice to forgive herself, she simply inhales a chemical that exonerates her.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lirael functions more as a vessel for prompt terms than a fully embodied character; her "visionary" nature is stated rather than dramatized through unique perception. The central internal conflict—fear of losing humanity—is introduced and resolved abruptly without the requisite struggle or hesitation to make the final choice feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael is defined by the label "reckless idealist" rather than dramatized complexity. Her transformation from reckless to "fiercely gentle" is achieved through a magical ritual and consumption of fruit rather than a hard, character-defining choice under pressure. The internal conflict (guilt) is resolved by external magic, bypassing genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lenny’s internal state is legible, but the pivotal emotional shift relies on diagnostic interiority (“insulating himself... with facts”) rather than dramatized friction. The realization of purpose feels unearned by the immediate scene pressure, and his transition from self-doubt to clarity is resolved too neatly in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.4)
    Characterization relies on label-insertion ("kindly methodical") rather than dramatized traits that constrain choice. Elara lacks internal contradiction or grit; she functions as a smooth vessel for the plot, facing no decision that forces a sacrifice of her values or safety.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.9)
    Character motivation relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Routine is a cage," "I've always feared losing myself") rather than embodied struggle. The Librarian functions as a passive facilitator, and the Woman's transformation lacks internal conflict or reluctance, making the emotional arc feel transactional.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a delivery system for the plot's magical props rather than a fully realized agent. His motivation for keeping the pearl is vague ("unsure why"), and the pivotal moment of hesitation lacks grounded internal conflict or competing values. Emotional progression relies on abstract labels ("regret," "longing") rather than specific, embodied reactions to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority leans heavily on diagnostic labels ("labyrinth of her regrets," "channels where shame festered") rather than embodied struggle. The choice to map her heart is a valid turn, but the "truth-seeking" persona feels more like a stated role than a demonstrated trait under pressure. The epiphany arrives through external prompts rather than internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("Her motivation was clear," "cautious exuberance") rather than dramatized desire or internal conflict. Lira functions as a cipher solver rather than a complex agent; her reaction to the climax is a simple smile, lacking the contradictory emotional layering or cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira demonstrates clear agency and interiority, driving the plot through active choices (divination, rejection). However, her temptation toward the "empire" feels abstract and unrooted in prior character desire, making the final renunciation feel slightly less earned emotionally. The "telepathic with plants" trait serves the plot well but feels convenient rather than deeply integrated into her worldview until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lirael’s dual role acts as a functional plot device for the resolution, but she lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The climax relies on her competence and ready inventory rather than forcing a difficult choice or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("committed caretaker," "anger dissolved," "trust remained fragile") rather than embodied reaction. Emotional progression is linear and lacks internal conflict; Lirael's forgiveness is a settled past event rather than a present-tense struggle, leaving her with no distinct on-page agency or crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions more as a magical technician than a fully realized protagonist; his "conscience for hire" role is stated but plays out as standard therapy-via-object. The internal contradiction of "sincerely insincere" is delivered as a label rather than a dramatized behavioral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist's backward aging is a compelling hook but remains ornamental; the "stripping away of identity" is stated in exposition but never threatens her agency or competence in the scene. Elara acts as a static, patient sage throughout, lacking the internal desperation or volatility that the premise implies. The apprentice relationship is functional but standard, lacking specific friction beyond the generic master-student dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.3)
    Kael is an archetype rather than a specific individual; he lacks contradictory impulses or internal friction. His "resolve" is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle or the temptation to quit. The character functions as a passive observer who solves a generational paradox without personal cost or emotional distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.5)
    Kael is defined by a label ("underachieving") that is immediately contradicted by his effortless success with a spell he supposedly never mastered. His emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized; the epiphany is instantaneous and lacks internal conflict or psychological resistance. He functions as a vehicle for the theme rather than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a consistent, embodied protagonist with a clear motivation (grief), but his defining trait ("hides behind truth") is stated rather than dramatized through choice. The emotional arc feels earned in tone but relies on stock interiority ("stain on his ears," "second heartbeat") rather than specific, individualized psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    Character attributes are labeled ("quietly enthusiastic") rather than dramatized through distinct behavior or friction. The internal arc—shedding "stellar doubt"—feels abstract and frictionless, resolving without a visible, felt cost or genuine struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared via backstory summary ("motivation had crystallized then") rather than dramatized through pressure. The emotional resolution relies on abstract labels ("distant intimacy") rather than a demonstrated shift in behavior or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, sympathetic protagonist whose limitations ("lukewarm") drive the plot. However, the attribute "earnestly naive" appears three times as a label rather than being purely dramatized through error, and the internal shift at the end feels slightly rushed, relying on a realized summary rather than an embodied emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara possesses clear interiority and a defined role, but her pivot from hoarding to sharing is driven by external instruction (the daughter) rather than internal pressure. The protagonist feels reactive to the secondary character's exposition, weakening the earned nature of the final choice. The emotional shift relies on the daughter explaining Elias's motives rather than Mara discovering them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the character reads as a vessel for the theme rather than a psychological entity. The internal conflict is stated via backstory labels ("stern logician," "poet") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The epiphany ("it was a *permission*") feels intellectual and unearned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is a competent focalizer, but his motivation feels expository rather than visceral; the connection to his mother is stated in summary ("turning survival into a kind of poetry") rather than dramatized in the immediate moment. His internal struggle is low-contrast, resolving quickly into acceptance without a moment of genuine doubt or temptation to abandon the duty.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on stated traits ("motivation burned like a wildfire") and stock archetypes. The clone functions as a generic "evil twin" mirror without distinct interiority or tactical depth. The protagonist's transition from numbness to "emotions flaring" is asserted rather than dramatized through specific, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with consistent traits, but his internal arc feels largely expository rather than dramatized through struggle. The shift from "forcing" to "flow" is stated as a realization upon finding the key, rather than an earned psychological pivot forced by pressure. His agency is primarily reactive (observing, following), and the lack of a difficult choice limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.4)
    Marlowe is a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His emotional arc is a linear ramp of exertion without a defining micro-choice or psychological cost beyond generic fatigue. The trait "mournfully eager" acts as a static label rather than a driver of behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is a distinct protagonist with clear motivation (homesickness) and physical grounding ("claws digging," "voice rough"). However, the "feral" trait clashes slightly with her highly articulate, philosophical dialogue in the confrontation. Her final choice to abandon her oath for home is a strong character beat, though the antagonist feels somewhat stock.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kael is defined largely by labels ("hopeless," "stoically sensitive") rather than demonstrated behavior before the crisis. While the motivation to fix the crozier is clear, the transition from paralysis to mastery relies on a sudden, unbidden recovery of knowledge ("Vivify") rather than character-driven logic. The internal conflict is resolved too neatly by this externalized epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character with contradictory impulses. The pivotal epiphany—"understanding" that the beginning is a state of being—is delivered via summary interiority ("In that instant, he understood") rather than earned through a dramatized, high-stakes choice with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions as a plot vessel rather than a fully realized character; his motivation to "merge timelines" is accepted too easily given the catastrophic stakes ("unravel reality"). The attribute "resiliently positive" appears three times as a told label rather than a demonstrated behavior that constrains choice, weakening the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("fever dream architect") rather than specific, embodied traits. The motivation is philosophical and stated outright ("to prove that logic and magic could coexist") rather than demonstrated through a difficult, high-stakes choice. Emotional reactions are generic ("breath quickened," "heart pounding") and do not deepen the interiority beyond the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lirael acts consistently as an instructor, but her internal conflict ("felt adrift") is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses. She functions primarily as a vehicle for the lesson, lacking the specific interiority or agency to drive a high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lila is a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction or a hierarchy of values tested by pressure. The defining attribute ("persistently curious") is asserted via narrative telling rather than demonstrated through a choice that carries risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("claustrophobia spiked") and somatic clichés ("pulse raced") rather than embodied perception. The phobia adds texture but is overcome linearly without forcing a complex trade-off or shifting the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly defined by his compulsion and history, but his internal arc feels somewhat abstract and performative rather than viscerally driven. The choice to embrace the error is a valid psychological shift, but the emotional cost is obscured by the heavy metaphorical layering of his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is distinct but functions more as a mythic archetype than a psychological entity. The final pivot—claiming "I am the extinction"—feels theatrical and performed for thematic effect rather than a choice emerging organically from prior interiority or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s internal conflict between scientific detachment and the allure of the "untamed" is clear, but her pivot to acceptance relies heavily on a sudden memory of a mentor's quote rather than a visceral, dramatized urge. The transformation changes her, yet her immediate return to human form feels slightly disconnected from the profound psychological shift just experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; she is defined solely by her role and static motivation ("to reawaken beauty"). Her struggle is purely physical (bleeding fingers) rather than psychological, and she faces no difficult choice between competing values. The characterization relies on archetype rather than specific interiority, making her a vehicle for the plot rather than a living protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear but static; he faces no genuine internal or external opposition. The "rebellious" choice to smuggle the bottle is frictionless—soldiers do not intervene, and the drone accepts the package without issue—resulting in a lack of felt cost or earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elio acts as a passive vessel for description rather than a protagonist under pressure. His motivation ("interpret silence as possibility") is abstract and never tested by genuine resistance or tough choices. The "realization" at the end feels unearned because he faces no internal contradiction or external cost; he simply moves from room to room until the story concludes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on romanticized archetypes ("keeper of ghosts") and self-labeling ("sanely eccentric") rather than distinct behavior under pressure. The protagonist's internal state is summarized ("felt a restlessness") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the prose rather than an agent with internal grit; her conflicts are solved by magical intervention. The emotional realization at the end—accepting the self—lacks on-page psychological struggle or contradictory impulses, feeling like a mandate rather than an earned growth.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("enigmatic," "unassumingly bold") rather than demonstrated behavior. Elias’s motivation is abstract ("free an idea"), and his internal conflict is asserted via "trembling fingers" rather than dramatized through difficult choices or hesitation. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the prompt than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is extrinsic, driven by a convenient dream rather than internal pressure or conflicting needs. Elias encounters a warning about a "price" in the journal, but this setup is abandoned; he pays no emotional or physical cost for the discovery. He remains static, ending exactly as he began—a curious folklorist—without a decisive internal shift or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("mentored resilience," "combative tenderness") rather than embodied action. The nervous habit of walking backwards is a convenient plot key rather than a deeply felt trait, and the visitor’s instant compliance lacks psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype with clear motivation ("preserve the color"), but her interiority relies on elevated abstractions rather than embodied emotion. The attribute "insatiably creative" is stated but undercut by the plot, where she merely follows a dream's instructions rather than innovating a solution. The lack of contradictory impulses or hesitation lowers the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.3)
    Mara serves as a passive observer who relies entirely on Elias for exposition and direction; her internal conflict is summarized in abstract terms rather than dramatized through contradictory choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a distinct skillset, but his journey lacks internal conflict or felt cost. His success feels inevitable, and the trait "methodically curious" operates more as a label than a source of dramatic friction or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is consistent and introspective, but her "first-name basis with Death" trait is established via exposition rather than interaction. Her agency is primarily observational; the breakthrough relies on a coincidental connection rather than a pressure-driven choice or specific competence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is a collection of sentimental attributes ("frayed edges of a cloud") rather than a character with agency or grit. His motivation is stated explicitly ("to articulate unspoken needs") but lacks dramatic friction; he faces no internal opposition or difficult choices. The "seldom-heard balladeer" tag feels largely ornamental since he functions primarily as a visual artist here.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation shifts abruptly from duty to bold revelation without sufficient internal struggle. The widow's instant transition from grief-stricken mask to laughter upon a single touch feels unearned and melodramatic. The psychological progression is too tidy for a story aiming at literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lila’s obsession is well-drawn, anchoring the fable-like logic of the story. However, her lack of survival instinct in the face of a life-threatening drift feels slightly performative, prioritizing thematic posture over psychological realism even within the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s interiority is textured, and her prosopagnosia is woven into her perception of the world ("memorized souls through textures"). However, the condition functions more as a superpower for pattern recognition than a genuine constraint or limit that forces a difficult trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lira’s motivation is stated via labels ("curiosity had always been her compass") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. She faces no internal contradiction or genuine cost; her "struggle" is merely a procedural puzzle-solving exercise without emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    Kael functions as a capable archetype with a clear goal, but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. His success relies on a pre-existing tool (the vial) rather than a character-defining choice or sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies almost entirely on expository labels ("altruistic," "consistent," "trustworthy") rather than dramatized behavior. Elara lacks internal contradiction or struggle, acting as a benevolent plot device, while the "settlers" function as a monolithic, cooperative mass without individual distinctness or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal conflict (accepting flaws) is resolved through summary rather than dramatized struggle ("Mara didn't flinch... her flaws embraced"). The realization that the puppet head was a "map" feels like an unearned logical leap rather than a derived discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael is a solid focalizer with clear motivation (survival vs. duty) and a defined internal conflict. His choice to physically intervene ("shoving her") against the rules demonstrates agency and prioritization of life over the curse. However, his interiority relies slightly on standard "reluctant guardian" tropes without deeper idiosyncratic shading.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on "diagnostic label-speak" ("symphonically minded") and metaphor to convey emotion rather than embodied reaction. While the internal logic is consistent, the transition from grief to "loosened grief" feels like an intellectual exercise triggered by the foam rather than a visceral emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.7)
    Elara functions primarily as a vendor of concepts rather than a character with embodied contradictions or agency under pressure. Her climactic moment is passive—she waits and receives a magical refund—and her emotional arc resolves via an unearned realization rather than a difficult choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Nessar’s internal motivation—treating memory as a culinary ingredient to be balanced—is compelling and drives the narrative arc effectively. His choice to submerge his hands and accept the founder's guilt demonstrates strong agency and capacity for suffering. However, his passivity during the guard's approach (freezing until the threat inexplicably retreats) undermines his competence under external pressure; a more active evasion or confrontation would have heightened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an idealized vehicle for the theme rather than a character under pressure; she possesses every skill required (soldering, singing, languages) without struggle or flaw. The attribute "empathetically decisive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through a difficult choice. There is no internal conflict or embodied cost; her success is immediate and absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.4)
    Kael is defined by labels ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise") rather than behavior; these traits do not constrain his choices. His motivation is articulated through abstract summary ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than visceral desire, and his internal struggle resolves through generic determination rather than a specific character-driven tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.9)
    Lira is defined by labels ("prism-minded," "archivist") rather than contradictory impulses or choices under pressure. She acts as a functional vehicle for the plot, following instructions (doodles, maps) without displaying internal conflict or distinct personality traits beyond her job description. The "intuition humming" moment substitutes for a character-revealing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara functions as an archetype of the "healer artist" rather than a specific individual; her struggle is externalized through the cliché of bleeding fingers rather than internal dilemma. The phrase "symphonically minded mind" creates a tautology that distances the reader from genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for the plot rather than a driven agent; his success relies on a convenient prop (the key) rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. Emotional interiority is labeled ("deepened his resolve") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies on label-heavy telling ("eclectic pacifist," "collector of quiet moments") rather than demonstrated traits. The protagonist's motivation is abstract ("catalog the varieties of silence"), and her emotional connection to the grandmother is summarized rather than dramatized through specific memories or interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist's journey is presented as a summary of intent rather than a dramatized struggle. Her pivotal change relies on a dream epiphany rather than an active choice under pressure, and emotional states are labeled ("ambitious," "breathless") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira is a functional protagonist defined solely by her job and mission, lacking internal contradiction or distinct voice. Her reaction to the climax—a simple smile and a tidy realization—misses the opportunity for genuine emotional cost or complexity. The "intrepid" label does not substitute for dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Anya is a competent focalizer, but her interiority relies on stated backstory rather than active pressure. The prompt phrase "rapidly adapting mind" is inserted as a diagnostic tell rather than dramatized through a complex choice, which flattens the characterization in the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira functions as a thematic vehicle without internal conflict; her desire to "certify wonder" meets no resistance and incurs no cost. Veyra’s instant conversion from skeptic to believer lacks credible struggle, rendering the character dynamics frictionless and the emotions performative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene; the protagonist's desire to "harvest insights" is dramatized through action. The emotional arc from frustration to surrender is legible, though the "visions of past failures" sequence relies on generic hallucinatory tropes rather than specific, grounded character details.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's defining trait ("borrowing personalities") appears only in summary and does not drive his tactics in the scene. The emotional pivot relies on a sudden, explicitly stated epiphany rather than an earned internal shift through action. The transition from detached analyst to feeling participant happens instantaneously via magical contact, bypassing credible psychological resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kail is a passive protagonist who follows instructions from a convenient guide rather than driving the plot through choice. His defining trait ("jittery") is a label that vanishes upon the magical resolution, lacking a dramatized internal struggle or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and the internal arc of seeking validation is legible. However, characterization relies on stock descriptions ("eyes the color of storm clouds") and the internal realization is summarized via diagnostic labeling ("yearning for validation") rather than fully dramatized through specific memories or distinct behavioral flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara serves effectively as a fable archetype, with motivation rooted clearly in the backstory of the silence. While her dedication is legible, the moment of sacrifice feels slightly rushed; the internal struggle between possessing the bead and releasing it is resolved through swift realization rather than dramatized hesitation or conflicting impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.5)
    Jorin is a functional archetype rather than a specific individual; his "meekness" is stated but overridden by unwavering, generic heroism without internal conflict. The characterization relies on labels ("quiet fire," "deliberate nature") rather than dramatized struggle, and his interactions with secondary characters feel like RPG quest triggers rather than genuine relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.6)
    Kael functions primarily as a vessel for the shard’s compulsion rather than an agent of active choice until the final paragraph. His internal landscape is defined by the "weight" of the past, but his journey into the portal is driven by an external "pull" rather than an active decision to transgress. The confrontation with the mother figure lacks emotional friction; she functions as an expository device rather than a distinct character, and his immediate acceptance of her vague wisdom feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias functions primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's instructions rather than an agent of change. He follows the anonymous notes without significant skepticism, struggle, or on-page cost, making his compliance feel mechanical. The emotional realization at the end is told via summary ("Elias realized why...") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's titular trait ("Laughing Storm Herald") feels like a label rather than an embodied compulsion; the laughter reads as performative. Her interiority is generic ("she didn't mind," "she’d always known"), and her pivotal decision—"Let's do this"—relies on stock action-hero dialogue rather than specific character motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lin’s internal conflict (donor heart vs. old self) provides a functional motivation for the scene, but her "desperation" is told via interior summary rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The "dye master" aspect colors the opening but is abandoned for the main action, failing to shape the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the setting rather than a character with conflicting drives; his motivation (curiosity about trees) is stated but faces no significant internal opposition. He moves through the scene with competence and ease, lacking the struggle or "blind spots" required for higher bands. The emotional arc is static—he begins curious and ends satisfied—without a moment of costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lira functions as a magical conduit rather than a character with agency or internal conflict; she faces no difficult choices, only procedural tasks. Her exhaustion is stated ("hands, calloused") but does not impede her actions or force a trade-off. The "scattered memory" trait is expository flavor rather than a constraint that complicates the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor is defined by labels ("compassionate recluse," "keen empathy") rather than action; her empathy acts as a passive sensor rather than a crucible for choice. She lacks agency in the second half, simply following instructions (sit, follow map, take key) without generating friction or making a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias is a consistent focalizer, but his arc is largely passive; he observes rather than decides under pressure. The characterization relies on summary ("always been the one to notice") rather than dramatized struggle, and the lack of contradictory impulses results in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is a functional protagonist, but her interiority is delivered through exposition ("motivation was clear") rather than embodied struggle. The shift from "gently meticulous" to desk-slamming frustration feels like stock performance rather than character-specific behavior, and her success relies on effort ("faster this time") rather than a character-defining choice or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation is distinct and drives the scene; the choice to trade her father’s token to protect his secret is a strong, costly action. The revelation of his betrayal complicates her internal state effectively, though the explicit label of "stubbornness with a thesaurus" feels more like authorial intrusion than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kael’s internal conflict (skepticism vs. experience) is established but undermined by his immediate acceptance of the supernatural premise without struggle. The "luminous" descriptor confuses the character tag, reading as an oxymoron rather than a trait. While his sensory-tasting quirk is specific and embodied, his passivity at the climax limits emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    Elias functions more as a vessel for the prompt’s themes than a living character; his motivation is delivered via diagnostic summary ("uncork the suppressed creativity") rather than embodied struggle. The internal conflict is labeled ("traded his true passion for stability") but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene; he simply proceeds without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly drawn, and the quill serves as an effective externalization of her internal drive for truth. However, her emotional pivot from accuser to ally upon the Keeper's confession feels slightly rushed, lacking the friction or skepticism a lifelong truth-seeker might exhibit. The resolution relies on a shared philosophical understanding rather than a deeply felt character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    Elara functions as a thematic avatar rather than a character under pressure; her motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her "seasonally mute" trait imposes no visible cost or complication in the scene, as she faces no urgent need to speak. The lack of internal contradiction or embodied struggle leaves her flat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara-7 functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a complex agent; her internal conflict is stated ("static") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The transition from anxiety to acceptance is smooth and unearned by struggle, lacking a moment where she must choose between safety and the risk of integration. The "childhood fears" box serves as a convenient prop, and her emotional arc resolves into "therapy-speak" realization without visible behavioral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Clara is a functional vehicle for the plot with no internal contradiction or cost. Her motivation is purely curiosity, and her emotional reaction ("tears filled her eyes") feels unearned by the low-stakes investigation. The connection to the soldier (sharing the name Clara) is a coincidental device rather than a character-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael is competent but static; his "vulnerability" is a stated theme rather than a lived emotional risk or flaw. He faces external puzzles without internal cost or contradiction, making him a vessel for the concept rather than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias has a clear motivation (recovering the wife's memory), but his interiority relies on stock phrases ("talisman against the void") rather than specific, embodied emotion. The character remains static; his grief is stated rather than dramatized through complex conflicting impulses or high-stakes micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined solely by her role ("summoner") and the prompt's required attributes. Motivation is stated abstractly ("burned like a tranquil blaze") rather than dramatized through struggle or trade-offs. There is no internal conflict; she executes a plan perfectly without hesitation or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias acts as a functional lens but lacks agency; he accepts the genre-shifting reveal of an alien architect and a magic ritual with only a passive shudder, bypassing genuine internal conflict. The relationship is asserted through expository dialogue about the past rather than demonstrated through dynamic tension in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on prompt labels ("charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant") rather than dramatized traits. Lirael's internal struggle is conveyed through abstract metaphors ("archived every failure") rather than concrete psychological reality. The skepticism is stated but never enacted; she accepts the magical solution immediately without the resistance her label implies.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s motivation is conceptually strong, but her internal state is conveyed more through thematic exposition than embodied struggle in the moment. The "trembling" provides a brief physical anchor, but her competence overrides potential conflict, making her feel more like a vehicle for the premise than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a passive vessel for the concept, encountering no internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His motivation is purely intellectual ("to learn"), and he faces no emotional obstacles or difficult choices that would define character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; he faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult choices. His "gift" and motivation are stated in exposition but never tested by pressure, resulting in a character who feels like a narrative device rather than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael functions as a thematic vessel defined by labels ("net-mender philosopher") rather than a character with embodied conflict or agency; his interiority consists of essayistic assertions ("To appreciate hidden effort...") rather than genuine struggle. He faces no difficult choices or costs, remaining a passive observer throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara is a competent protagonist, but her rapid shift from skeptic to believer feels unearned. Her problem-solving relies heavily on "intuition" as a trait rather than dramatized deduction, and her motivation pivots abruptly to survival in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("visionary," "lonely") rather than choices under pressure; his primary action is following instructions from the radio. Interiority relies on high-flown abstraction ("whispers from a time before time") rather than embodied emotion or specific human cost. The realization at the end ("You are the storm") feels unearned because the character lacks a dramatized internal struggle or flaw to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias is a stock "dreamy artist" archetype lacking internal contradiction or grit. His motivation is stated ("sweeten the world's sharp edges") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and his success comes without personal cost or evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on stock dichotomies ("equations" vs. "song") and prompt-inserted labels ("logically emotional") rather than embodied complexity. The protagonist does not struggle with a meaningful choice; he simply accepts the paradox and enacts the solution without internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Internal conflict is labeled rather than embodied; Kael’s "impatience" is stated as a trait but his actions are merely "hurried," lacking visceral struggle or consequence. The transformation to "softly purposeful" occurs in summary, distancing the reader from the character's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s motivation to escape control is clear, but her shift from victim to survivor relies on asserted epiphany rather than a dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The prompt attribute "watchfully calm" is applied as a label, yet she immediately gasps and trembles, creating an inconsistency between the stated trait and her embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's "deliberate" nature is stated as a label but contradicted by his rapid, sentimental conversion after viewing a single object. Internal conflict regarding the warden's "hidden purpose" is resolved without genuine scrutiny or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lira is a functional protagonist driven by a clear, obsessive goal ("ring a bell no one hears"), but she fits the "mad scientist" archetype comfortably without deeper subversion. While her "gears with feet" retort adds voice, her internal struggle is minimal; the transition from obsession to triumph feels linear and lacks a moment of agonizing doubt or conflicting impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.7)
    Lira functions as a standard archetype (the determined seeker) with motivation declared in exposition rather than emerging from complex internal conflict. The attribute "brightly attentive" is applied as a repetitive label rather than shown through specific, costly observation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara is an archetype defined by complimentary labels ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") rather than dramatized choices. She lacks internal conflict or flaws; her success is guaranteed by her inherent nature, offering no friction or character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila’s internal "changed" state is established but resolved through a standard "rescue heals the rescuer" trope rather than a character-specific internal shift or cost. The transition from wanting euthanasia to finding peace feels unearned by the relative ease of the climax, and the "heroic" outcome simplifies her complex grief too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characters function as archetypes (Sage, Frustrated Artist) rather than specific individuals. Elias's motivation is delivered via diagnostic label-speak ("nurturing intersubjective understanding") rather than embodied struggle, and Lila’s emotional pivot lacks resistance or psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on archetype and stated traits rather than behavior under pressure. Mara is defined by her function ("line walker," "duty") and prompt labels ("strangely honest") without interior conflict or difficult choices. The "honesty" is name-checked in dialogue but never compels a costly action or creates friction; she and the prophet operate in perfect, frictionless concord.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("subtle puzzle archivist," "perceptively calm") rather than demonstrated traits. Interiority consists of summarized beliefs and lessons rather than active, embodied thought. The emotional arc feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant internal resistance or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist's transition from "reticent" to feeling an "urgency to share" is sudden and unearned by the minimal pressure of the scene. The motivation ("decode the pattern") is abstract and intellectual, lacking visceral or emotional cost. The internal conflict is resolved too easily via a single moment of observation, making the character arc feel convenient rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is stated ("tidal longing") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page impulses; the character's struggle is primarily physical discomfort (aching knees) rather than a deep psychological cost or trade-off enacted in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is a functional protagonist whose skills drive the plot, but his motivation ("harness the ephemeral") feels abstract and prompt-heavy rather than lived. The transition from repairman to cosmic traveler relies on a sudden shift in competence that feels unearned by his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira is functional as a protagonist but lacks internal friction; her motivation ("execute a flawless goodbye") feels more performative than human. Her connection to the patient via her mother's memory is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her emotions are often summarized with labels ("chest ached," "joy") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lirael is a functional archetype with no internal contradiction or meaningful struggle. Her motivation is intellectual ("to find where shadows go") without emotional weight or consequence for failure. The narrative lacks a moment where she must choose between competing values; she simply persists until she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara’s labeled skepticism is immediately contradicted by her unquestioning reliance on a magical ritual, creating a fundamental fracture in character logic. The attribute "shrewdly innocent" is applied as a tag rather than demonstrated through complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on the scaffold of "memories resurfacing" rather than immediate, embodied struggle. The emotional arc feels somewhat static, as the backstory lessons provide answers before the character faces a true on-page crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lila’s internal state is legible, but the characterization suffers significantly from "therapy-speak" dialogue (e.g., "You’ve been proactive about grief," "I wanted to graft new meaning"). These lines reduce the characters to thematic mouthpieces rather than living people reacting under pressure. Elias functions purely as a supportive device without distinct agency or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara is a coherent protagonist with a clear motivation, but her internal conflict is resolved too easily by external validation from the doppelganger rather than genuine struggle. The "conflicted novelist" archetype feels standard, and her emotional arc lacks visceral friction; she discards the ending she "hated" without significant resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lira lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for depth; she functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a complex agent. Her motivation is clear but singular, and she faces no difficult choices that test her character beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses; his patience is stated as a trait rather than tested by the scene. The motivation (mapping heartbeats) remains abstract and does not force a difficult trade-off or visible cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias functions as a competent archetype rather than a fully realized character; his &quot;peripheral focus&quot; is a stated trait rather than a source of genuine internal struggle or cost. He experiences no meaningful contradictory impulses, and his doubt about the &quot;cellar of reason&quot; is raised but never forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is a competent protagonist with a clear professional drive and a personal anchor (mother) that complicates his task. The interiority regarding his mother's burden provides necessary depth, though the reliance on remembered aphorisms ("respect the weight," "some burdens are anchors") feels slightly didactic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.0)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ghostly echo," "hollowed her") rather than embodied behavior. The interiority explains Clara’s psychological state to the reader through summary ("method she’d chosen to process her grief") rather than showing it through friction or contradictory impulses. The epiphany feels constructed and intellectualized rather than earned through the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.4)
    Veyra’s internal conflict is resolved too abruptly by the ghost’s diagnostic dialogue ("You haven't forgiven yourself"), which externalizes the realization rather than dramatizing it through struggle. The swift shift from defiance to acceptance bypasses the necessary emotional processing, making the climax feel unearned. The "chronologically confused" trait is mentioned but acts more as atmospheric flavor than a constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("curious civil engineer intern," "penchant for functional creativity") rather than demonstrated behavior or interiority. Lila encounters no meaningful internal resistance or contradiction; her "functional creativity" is asserted as a superpower rather than a skill tested by failure or constraints. The emotional arc is static, moving from curiosity to "stoic wonder" without significant personal cost or evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s internal conflict between safety and wildness is rendered with clear, embodied interiority. The shift in her perspective is legible, though the resolution—a compromise where she keeps both safety and wildness—feels slightly convenient, lacking the sharp bite of a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.0)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("errant legend seeker") and declared motivation ("burns like a slow fuse") rather than dramatized choice. The "darkness within" is asserted as a crucible but never confronted or embodied in the scene; Elias simply ignores a warning and succeeds without internal struggle. The lack of a specific, flawed interiority reduces him to a generic archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but his primary trait ("infinitely patient") is asserted in exposition rather than tested by the scene; the puzzle is solved instantly by the artifact rather than endurance. The epiphany relies on an external oracle (the woman) explaining the lesson, reducing the protagonist's agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara functions as a passive observer and recording device rather than a protagonist under pressure; she faces no internal contradiction or resistance. Her success is immediate and unearned, with no visible psychological or physical cost to her "projecting presence."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype with emotions signaled via melodrama ("tears streaming") rather than specific embodiment. The closing pivot to a collective "We" contradicts the opening's emphasis on "centuries of solitude," rendering the relational arc and character consistency incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s internal conflict is clear, but the external recognition by the stranger relies on convenient exposition ("You're the firefighter...") rather than organic discovery. The protagonist’s identity is stated more than dramatized through high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on oxymoronic labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") rather than dramatized behavior; Lira acts with instant belief ("You're still here"), contradicting her supposed skepticism. There is no internal conflict or hesitation, making her a functional vessel for the plot rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lumin defines themselves clearly as a sentimentalist, establishing motivation early. However, their agency is limited; they primarily observe the gear and listen to the ghost's exposition rather than driving the scene through active struggle or difficult choices. The emotional resolution feels granted by the ancestor rather than earned by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    Marlow functions as a passive recipient of spectral wisdom rather than an active agent driving the scene. His internal state relies on abstract labeling ("weight of unspoken losses," "shape of collective grief") rather than embodied emotion or difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lirael is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("ethically diligent mind") rather than dramatized choice or internal conflict. Her actions are procedural—following instructions found on a tool—which limits agency and prevents a deeper exploration of her specific character beyond her role.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.4)
    Elara functions as a camera rather than a character; her "blithe" nature is a declared label that contradicts the gloomy setting without friction. She faces no internal conflict or meaningful resistance, and her motivation ("to discover the shape of intentions") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira is a static archetype of competence without internal conflict; she begins certain ("To dive is to know") and ends vindicated without psychological change. Her only cost is physical fatigue ("hands cramped"), avoiding the necessary emotional or relational price required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lira is defined by a stated vocation rather than dramatized choices. Her motivation is explicitly told ("not nobility but necessity") rather than demonstrated through a high-stakes trade-off or risk. The character remains static, observing and recording without confronting internal contradiction or paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on abstract interiority ("resin and regret," "emotions she cannot name") rather than specific, embodied psychology. Lira lacks contradictory impulses in the scene; her actions are linear and her resolve unshakeable, resulting in a flat trajectory without genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear yearning that drives the action. Mara functions well as a foil, though her pivot from skepticism to participation is slightly rapid for the word count. The "wannabe philosopher" trait is dramatized effectively through his obsession and dialogue, though his internal monologue occasionally drifts into self-conscious labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    Clara is defined by lyrical labels ("melted honey") and stated intent rather than choices under pressure. Elias’s transition from a "boy's crack" to a man's regret is told, not shown through behavior. The emotional arc is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or character flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a vessel for the prompt’s procedural steps rather than a character with deep internal conflict. Her motivation is stated explicitly ("gentle rebellion") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her success at the climax comes without a visible or felt personal cost beyond temporary physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist’s "involuntary truthfulness" functions as a convenient quirk rather than a flaw with genuine cost; it solves the climax without struggle. Motivation is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and the emotional arc feels linear and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a vessel for the ritual without emotional risk. Her motivation is purely intellectual, and she faces no significant opposition or difficult micro-choices that would reveal character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara’s decision to drink an unknown ancient fluid (“foxglove’s poison... perhaps”) breaks character credibility, particularly for someone seeking answers about a biologist relative; it feels like a reckless plot device rather than a motivated choice. Lumen functions primarily as an exposition delivery system rather than a character with distinct agency, resolving the protagonist's obstacles (the pedestal) for her. The emotional reaction to the "three revelations" is summarized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from obsession to the Resonant Reconfiguration of "witnessing" is a strong arc. However, the attribute "balancedly daring" is told rather than dramatized through action, slightly flattening the agency in that specific beat by explaining his nature instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lila’s "97 hours" of sleeplessness lacks physiological credibility, as she retains fine motor control for calligraphy and climbing; her internal arc is resolved by a coincidence (the subject is the neighbor's mother) rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lila's motivation is clear and drives the action, but she lacks internal contradiction or a moment of genuine cost. Her transition from despair to successful leader happens via summary ("Lila’s resolve hardened") rather than through a pressured, difficult choice in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation and agency. He demonstrates competence through the reverse-engineering process, and his obsession is palpable. The backstory regarding his father is functional but feels slightly standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's agency is significantly undercut because the advisor provides the solution ("feed it a lie") immediately, leaving her only to execute instructions. Emotional states are frequently labeled ("terror," "solace," "motivation") rather than embodied in reaction or specific physical detail. The "welcome" choice lacks internal friction, appearing as simple compliance with the advisor's prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    Leeward is a distinct, competent focalizer with embodied reactions ("hands trembled," "sweat sticking"). However, her internal landscape is somewhat functional, lacking a deep contradictory impulse or a difficult choice beyond the physical exertion of her task. The motivation is stated in dialogue rather than emerging solely from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is a competent protagonist with clear agency and a vocation that ties neatly to the plot. However, her emotional processing of the mother’s journal is rushed, moving too quickly from discovery to realization without sufficient internal reaction. The prompt insertion "quietly drove herself" feels mechanically forced into her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a generic investigator without distinct interiority or contradictory impulses; her reactions are logical steps rather than character-revealing choices. Tomas serves purely as an expository device ("NPC guide") to bridge plot gaps, lacking independent agency or depth. The interaction feels transactional and devoid of genuine relational friction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara is defined primarily by conflicting labels ("stoically sensitive") rather than dramatized internal conflict. Her connection to the grandmother feels generic and convenient, and her emotional arc is told through summary ("her true motive pulsed deeper") rather than revealed through pressure or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on inserted labels ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than enacted traits. Lira's internal life feels like a vehicle for these keywords, and her emotional arc—from indexer to truth-bearer—lacks the on-page struggle required to make the shift earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear, but the character's interiority relies heavily on polished aphorisms ("Dreams are just grief with wings") rather than raw, contradictory emotion. This "therapized" self-awareness distances the reader from the immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is visceral and her internal state tracks well with the action, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("It’s anger. It’s grief") rather than embodied reaction. This self-analysis during a high-pressure moment flattens the emotional reality into abstract categories, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lira acts with professional competence that contradicts the "perpetually surprised" trait label, which feels inserted rather than embodied. Her agency is limited; she relies on the pilgrim's instructions to solve the puzzle rather than her own ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a functional protagonist with a clear internal conflict (guilt vs. deception), but his interiority relies heavily on melodramatic metaphors ("conscience like barnacles") rather than nuanced psychology. His pivotal realization is driven by external magical visions rather than active deduction or character pressure, making his agency feel reactive until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clara is defined largely by backstory labels and exposition rather than present-tense complexity. The dialogue feels stagey and didactic, serving to deliver themes ("It's how we keep time here") rather than revealing character through organic friction. While the final choice distinguishes her from Elias, the "uncommonly thoughtful" trait is told, not shown through unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clara is a functional protagonist with a clear internal arc, but her transformation feels slightly rushed and reliant on a staged monologue rather than dramatized pressure. The repetition of the specific prompt phrase "merrily melancholic" as a label for her emotion flattens the interiority rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara is a coherent focalizer with a clear motivation ("relearn empathy"), but her role in the climax is largely passive. She functions as an audience for J.T.’s lesson rather than an active agent driving the turning point through high-stakes choice. The interiority is present but relies on slightly expository realizations ("The labyrinth wasn’t physical... it was the lake itself") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira is clearly drawn, but her internal conflict resolves too smoothly; the "refusal" mentioned is stated rather than dramatized, as she submits to the transformation immediately once the ritual begins. The reluctance feels like setup rather than a live resistance that complicates the action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal grief is well-rendered and specific, anchoring the ritual in clear motivation. The emotional arc is coherent, though the mother's dialogue leans into stock sentimentality ("little star") that simplifies the complex survivor guilt established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira is defined by high-concept traits rather than embodied behavior; her transition from lifelong avoidance to confronting the "shadow" is rushed and smoothed over by AI exposition. The internal struggle is summarized ("She had always believed...") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance. Her "steadfast" nature dissolves too easily when pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira acts as a passive vessel for the concept rather than a driver of action; her primary moves are complying with a letter and listening to an explanation. The "destitute philanthropist" trait functions as a label in backstory rather than a pressure-tested behavior in the scene. Her internal conflict ("wanted to fix things") is resolved by external authority rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.3)
    Characterization relies on archetypes and declared traits ("vigilant," "calmly inventive") rather than behavior under pressure. The protagonist’s motivation is stated via exposition ("motivation burned like a ember") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The relationship lacks friction or status dynamics; agreement is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear, but her internal arc feels slightly mechanical; the shift from controller to witness is an archetype rather than a deeply felt, idiosyncratic struggle. The emotional weight of her mother's loss is stated rather than dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's internal shift relies on external instructions (the found note) rather than a hard-won internal synthesis. Emotion is labeled ("felt furiously tranquil") rather than enacted through conflicting behavior or physiology.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.3)
    Kael and Elyra function as mouthpieces for the theme rather than realized individuals; their dialogue consists largely of abstract aphorisms ("Chaos is honesty"). Motivation is intellectual and abstract, lacking visceral cost or internal contradiction. The mechanical arm serves as a prop for "whirring" description rather than a source of genuine limitation or deeper characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Character motivation is clear ("rebuild"), but agency is weak; the protagonist resolves his central crisis by reading a magical note that appears in his tin rather than through an active, costly choice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("personality fractured") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Clara’s internal struggle is clear, but her transition from feeling trapped to finding a magical solution bypasses genuine agency or sacrifice. The "chaos of choice" is told rather than shown through difficult on-page decisions, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.5)
    Lira is functional, but her central internal conflict—the "luminous doubt"—is resolved too conveniently by reframing it as a "test" rather than a genuine struggle. The shift from doubt to resolve feels mechanical and unearned by the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.7)
    Yorick and Lira function as archetypal devices rather than realized characters; they lack internal contradiction or distinct psychological texture. The emotional resolution is precipitous and unearned, relying on "therapy-speak" (e.g., "I see you," "I'm sorry") rather than dramatized struggle. Motivation is stated but does not complicate the choices; the ghost's immediate acceptance of the apology flattens the relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority via concrete embodiment (calloused hands, fogged spectacles) and micro-choices (scraping vial, monitoring chrysalis); final humility earned through endurance against institute pressure, revealing contradictory impulses between cosmic expertise and earthly humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong embodied interiority and motivation rooted in glass artistry and post-survival hollowness propel micro-choices like palm-to-frost; realization of purpose feels earned via prior adaptive traits.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias's stubborn resistance to Marisol's tales shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, earning his final choice to stay; embodied via trembling hands and scoffing at the note. Childhood dream epiphany borders unearned but anchors prior grief motif without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to bridge generations intensifies credibly through council pushback and bell-ringing choice, earning the community's shift with felt risk of exposure. Interiority concrete in grip on humming bell sensing resolve. Minor flaw: council skepticism summarized without embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation clear and intensifies via memory and vial, compelling journey choices; interiority concrete in embodied warmth/breaths, but epiphany at pool veers toward unearned summary of collective emotion without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation to touch time's texture drives consistent micro-choices, embodied in fragment handling and vision overload; interior conflict surfaces in surging retrocognition vs. clarity gained. Final renunciation earned by causal buildup, with cost in lost visions and inert fragment. Minor tidiness in epiphany ("time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story") avoids peak diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation to plant resilience intensifies credibly to compel vial hurl at climax; actions align with patiently strategic trait shown in key decoding. Limited internal contradiction—mostly resolute endurance without shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Earned change at chains snapping feels rooted in prior causality without unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Concrete interiority via synesthetic vibrations and embodied pain ("clutched her ears") earns final endurance; motivation rooted in father's absence compels ritual choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's interior conflict peaks concretely when hesitating before offering the photo, revealing contradictory impulses to steal yet intuit the jar's demand, earning her transformation with the wilted lily as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong particularity in glassblower traits shown through calloused fingers shaping tasks and crack-tracing micro-choices; interior conflict embodied in whimsical narration amid abandonment fears. Final embrace of fractures earned via prior causality with visible cost in lighter steps. Minor slip in overt epiphanies like narrated philosophy slightly over-articulates without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila's phobias embodied concretely (hands shake, breath hitches) fuel adaptive micro-choices like sidestepping the lunge, earning her final readiness; contradictory impulses act in the confrontation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—neutron-star empiricism vs. raw greenhouse chaos—drives every micro-choice (scraping dust, filming chrysalis). Her habitual “preprocessing” is embodied, not labeled, and the final renunciation of institute approval carries visible social cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s “steadily adaptive” trait is dramatized in the frost-reading crawl and the decision to etch panels instead of sellable wares; the link between glass craft and new cartographic purpose is shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers scraping against stone,” “shard warm against her thigh”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is a late, slightly abstract leap from smuggler’s hobby to her life-purpose—cost is felt but could be sharper. Still, contradiction, micro-choice, and earned stance all click.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—voiceless yet driven to “compose”—is embodied in every micro-adjustment of the forks; the silently expressive trait costs her real social friction and shapes the final renunciation of speech. Elias functions as crucible: his silent witnessing forces her to risk the first audible note, crystallizing the Earned Stasis. The laugh-without-sound beat shows genuine irrational layering of grief and triumph. No diagnostic self-talk; trembling hands and frost-scarred case do the telling.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” nature is stated but never complicates choice in-scene; his turn from resisting revival to embracing stewardship is summarized. The interior contradiction between burying secrets and resurrecting them is asserted, not dramatized under pressure; only in the final line does he articulate the shift. Embodied emotion is vivid early (“hands trembled… salt-crusted ink”) but flattens to exposition once underwater. Micro-choices (welding glass, atlas-mending) are generic proxies for transformation; the cost is declared, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands brushing dust from the bell, the decision to “stop hiding”—and her micro-choice to ring the bell crystallizes the stake. The contradiction between fear and trust is dramatized, not labeled. Yet the council remains off-stage, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are muted; the cost is social but not fully embodied in a relationship crucible. Still, the endurance of naming carries credible cost under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“spiritually curious,” “need to understand”) rather than embodied contradiction. The pilgrim memory is recalled, not dramatized, so it informs but doesn’t pressure present choice. Her final shift to healer is declared, not tested by a forked decision with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so no relationship crucible; head-count is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's obsession with "texture of time" drives every beat; the interiority is sensorily anchored ("the fragment bit into her palm") and her final renunciation—designing a maze "to remember"—costs her the visions she craved. Flaw: the retrocognitive ability is declared, not dramatized as a prior burden; we see effects, not the trap constraining earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is lean but embodied—her fingers “brushing the cold floor,” chains “biting”—and her micro-choice to hurl the vial rather than hoard it crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet the transition from captive to liberator is compressed into a single clause (“The liberator was unchained at last”) that tells the shift instead of dramatizing the psychic cost of abandoning the shelter of chains.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s synesthetic cochlea and filial grief are vivid, but the final beat (“she smiled, battered but marveling”) summarizes rather than embodies the cost; the interior contradiction between curiosity and self-harm never crystallizes into a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The memory-forging quest remains compelling, yet the climax is narrated triumph rather than a charged stance with visible fallout. Still, her sensory bias drives every beat, and the filial silence motivates the crucible, so motivation mostly coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s thief-of-light identity is vivid and embodied—her sweat-slick gloves, angled lily stem, final laugh—but the internal contradiction never sharpens into a risky mistake; she trades a stolen photo and walks away richer, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than crucible-forced. The “quietly savvy” trait is shown, not told, yet never complicates her success or exposes a blind spot that would make the win feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interiority is textured—calloused fingers, glassblower’s patience—but the “contemplative” tag is asserted more than dramatized; only the final beat shows a micro-choice (keeping the cracked bookmark) that costs him the illusion of perfect answers. The mentor-backstory flash is a single reflective block that lands within the 20 % allowance and tilts his present stance, so no BRR penalty. Contradictory impulses (hunger for safe zones vs. embrace of fracture) stay largely summary until the last paragraph, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s phobias are embodied (shaking hands, breath hitch) and collide with her stunt-double reflexes; the contradiction fuels the climactic sidestep. The mother-daughter mirror lands via shell standoff, cost felt when Lila withholds it. Interiority stays concrete, though “vulnerability is power” edges label-speak. Micro-choices (decoding, hurling script) track her hierarchy of values cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to map silence while fearing its absorption—surfaces only in abstract rumination; no embodied cost is paid. The final “smile” is unearned because the only prior struggle is the paper “resisting,” not her own psyche. Mild obsession stays verbal; it never complicates her micro-choices or produces a visible mistake. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis (she keeps the scroll, foreclosing return to ordinary oracle work), but the price is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unit-17’s “curiosity” is asserted more than dramatized; its single observable decision—lifting the violin—restates the prompt. The robot never confronts a contradictory impulse under pressure, so the internal arc is flat. The ending’s “philosopher” tag is undramatized summary, not earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s shift from rule-bound registrar to translator-of-silence is credibly anchored in micro-choices—fetching the lens, pocketing the blank ticket—each carrying a visible, accumulating cost. His interior contradiction (fear of unspoken truth vs hunger for it) is dramatized in embodied beats rather than labels. The final refusal to write, instead doodling the lens, is an earned renunciation that forecloses his old identity. Secondary pressure from Lira is crisp, but her motivation stays slightly schematic; still, the relationship crucible succeeds in forcing Elias’s stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her gnarled hands, the feel of marble chips, the way she redirects a vine to block a sensor. The contradiction between refusing algorithms yet outwitting them is lived, not declared. Micro-choices (polishing, redirecting, gifting a marble) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory > metrics. The final refusal to hide cracks feels earned because every prior marble already carried visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s obliging nature stays surface-level; we see no interior contradiction when she obeys LUX’s barked “Recalibrate!”—a missed crucible moment. The “curiosity” ascribed in the final paragraph is told, not dramatized; her micro-choices never risk her self-image or status. Still, her gauntlet clicks and sweat trace embodied cost, keeping her above generic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clara’s timpanist identity is more costume than crucible; her musician-specific skills never face a real test under water. The “ghost-code” obsession is dramatized through tactile choices—dunking the program, memorizing symbols—so the motive feels lived-in rather than declared. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of crystallizing commitment (“I’ll finish it”) is slightly under-prepped; the cost is promised, not yet embodied. Still, her flawed obsession and solitary agency carry the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s fever-shift from precision to margin-haunting is vivid, but her final pivot to “carry the truth” is declared twice rather than shown in one irreversible act; the swallowed truth never gains external pressure (no director confrontation, no crew betrayal) so her cost feels internal-only. Micro-choices—pressing forehead to glass, tracing veins—are specific, yet they repeat the same beat of anxious noticing; stronger contradiction or risk inside the station would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s reckless-explorer trait is credibly embodied (headlamp, valve trophy, descent) and his skeptical bent is stressed in-scene when the valve first speaks. Interiority is concrete but occasionally drifts into outline (“his skepticism fraying”) rather than split-second contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the wheel—carries visible cost yet feels one beat short of a fully embodied knife-turn; still, motivation tracks and flaw complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper’s longing for “to witness change without judgment” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction under pressure; choices are largely obedient to the origami map rather than active value tests. No micro-choice shows the cost of loosening judgment—silence simply arrives as gift. The final renunciation is gentle but causally thin because the stakes were never sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—tout “ordinary magic” yet crave Mara’s conversion—remains credible; soft adaptation is shown via cello invitation and light surrender of the curl. Mara’s visible shift from eyeroll to pocketing the curl supplies a small but earned change. Both characters read as individuals, though backstory stays minor. The cost is light; no path is foreclosed, only a mood captured, so the change feels gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s obsession with “stories walls have heard” is vivid and embodied in tactile sifting of ash; the contradiction between archival reverence and the need to burn/erase is hinted but never crystallizes into a moment where he must sacrifice either the wall-memories or his own safety. Interiority is specific, but the final beat—“he opened his mouth to speak”—is still preparatory; we don’t see the actual cost of voicing the ghosts, so the arc feels one beat short of earned renunciation/change.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—obedience to paternal design vs. desire to “transpose life into a new key”—is stated, not embodied; we never see her struggle between two live options under pressure, only a calm succession of tasks. The inherited-cause motivation is clear but remains abstract; her single micro-choice (typing the new fortune) is under-prepped, so the cost of that turn feels negligible. Emotional states are rendered via label (“restlessness,” “smiled”) rather than contradictory, embodied sensation. Closure choice is rational, not wrung through flaw or desire, so renunciation/change lands as concept, not lived decision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The priest’s obsessive interiority is vivid—his fingers “brushing cold metal,” his mind “racing” while loops build—but the palette remains a prop rather than a contradictory impulse. The loops function as externalized thought, so agency is visible, yet the single color never collides internally with his creed; it only illustrates focus. Because the palette fails to complicate desire, the arc is a clean ascent rather than a bruised endurance, so the cost feels conceptual, not personal. Still, the embodied performance under escalating paradox pressure keeps him credibly flawed and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid and specific—her chronological homesickness is embodied in the way she traces the shell “mapping childhood memories onto its curves.” The flaw (temporal displacement) directly shapes her goal of composing “unheard symphonies” from silence, and her micro-choice to write fortunes that are “maps back” shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she writes until “exhaustion loomed.” Missing 9-band because no second character appears, so relationship crucible and status dynamics cannot test; the arc is solitary renunciation rather than interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to float above risk yet craving grounded connection—are credibly embodied in the tablet choice and final descent. The “feeling it ebbing now” line gives concrete visceral signal of cost. Interiority lapses into thematic labels (“conquer the labyrinth of self”) that feel pre-digested rather than lived, muting full immersion. Still, the earned renunciation of flight for touch carries visible price and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while craving feeling—play out in her micro-choice to accept Elias’s “filament of hush”; embodied tremor when reversed Coltrane vibrates her sternum; renunciation of the needle’s sharpness for a copper wire that prolongs vibration costs her the ability to “hear” in any conventional sense. The deafness is more label than lived difference—no misbelief or stigma is tested—but the emotional arc lands with earned cost: she trades clinical numbness for a quieter, riskier sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s meticulousness is shown through tactile recorder business and the rooftop detour, but interiority drifts into tidy self-labeling (“keeper of secrets”) that over-explains the turn. The vial hand-off is a decisive micro-choice, yet the woman’s instant trust feels schematic, blunting status friction. Contradictory impulses appear early (data vs. intuition) but compress into one narrated beat rather than simultaneous scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her “aromatic caution” is shown through flinching at cedarwood and trembling before the vial—and the final micro-choice to inhale despite risk crystallizes her arc. Yet the causality of that final beat leans on external magic (UV reveal) more than prior flaw-compounded mistakes; the only cost is retrospective tears, not a foreclosed path. The inherited-grief revelation is emotionally specific but lands as epiphany rather than earned renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and the embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak, keeping the portrait above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—poet who flees commitment vs. man now forced to read his own abandoned threads—is dramatized in the final beat of untying; the embodied tremor and throat-tighten give us raw cost without label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: rope first as survival talisman, then as mirror of poetic evasions, finally as confession. The turn from “ethical playfulness” to naked self-reckoning is earned because each loosened knot releases a named memory on the page. Flaw: playfulness trait asserted more than enacted; we hear the label twice before we see it complicate a decision, so motivation apex dips shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing the cracks,” the restlessness of acute hearing—yet the moment she decides to “break” the silence is more declared than embodied; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies the shift from grief to gift. The final gesture of holding up the bowl reads as symbolic rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, her embodied perception and the violin’s damp strings keep her convincingly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—profit-seeking yet empathy-driven—are dramatized in the blotter-petal beat where he both tests and sells the sorrow-dulling scent. His “practiced curve” smile versus interior calculation shows external/inner split without diagnostic speak. The final archiving of the used petal crystallizes his affectionate detachment with visible cost: he keeps the trace of someone else’s erased pain. One hairline slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices—no botched vial or clock pressure tests him.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clara's brittle numeromania and her sudden, unexamined pivot to altruism are rendered with sensory specificity ("heels crunching gravel," pulse quickening), but the interior contradiction between profit-minded broker and spontaneous Samaritan is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final ledger entry feels more symbolic than costly because her professional stake is never pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is shown only in his impulse to seek Veyra, not in any tested contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; the interiority is poetic label (“luminescent ache”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship-as-crucible pressure since Lira is revealed only at the end. Earned stasis is present but thin: the cost of shared loneliness is declared, not dramatized in a beat where he must renounce or pay. Still, the arc from solitary maker to co-weaver is legible and tied to his vocation, keeping it above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lila’s illustrator identity supplies observational precision, but her interiority remains decorative (“poetic nonsense”) rather than contradictory under pressure. The pendant twist is externally driven; her agency is reactive, not a crucible of conflicting values. No embodied emotional degradation—just awe and summary labels. The “cost” is conceptual, not dramatized through her body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is embodied in the way she handles the glass eyes and reads the mosaic cracks. The twin-loss motive is consistent and personal, driving every micro-choice. The final renunciation—accepting loss as alive, not empty—carries credible cost, though the shift is announced more than dramatized. One hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” flirts with diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s kindly-methodical trait is shown through ritualistic caching and cautious tape search, but interiority stays summary-level; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values. The climactic decision to share the cache is stated, not dramatized, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Character knowledge is tight, yet flaw/struggle is muted, keeping her just above stock guardian archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—control versus surrender—runs cleanly through every beat; her palm-on-moss micro-choice anchors the arc. The hellebore’s visible metamorphosis crystallizes her renunciation with bodily cost (hand withheld, breath held). Yet the assistant Mara functions mainly as expository foil; no status shift or conflicting desire pressures Eleanor in-scene, so relationship crucible stays latent. Still, the single-POV interiority is specific, plant-knower’s voice, never label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marin’s insomnia-painter identity is vividly anchored in the first paragraph and keeps paying off: sleeplessness drives her night-walk, her pigment-making, her receptiveness to the stranger. Interiority stays concrete (“wryly earnest” is shown when she mutters about rain giving answers). The stranger’s motivation is thinner—why sketch her for years yet wait until tonight?—but the micro-choice to grind the brooch and paint feels inevitable and costly, earning the closing renunciation of puzzle-solving for conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s curiosity-over-caution mettle rings true in the moment she pockets the pearl; interiority stays sharp (“breath caught… throat tighten”) and contradicts her de facto job title. The pilgrim remains archetype-as-plot-device—shadows & onyx teeth, no interior hinge—so relationship pressure leaks one-way only. The earned cost—hearing the cave’s “unpredictable hum for good”—is vivid and specific, but the choice feels more imposed on her than catalyzed by layered motive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s “reactively visionary” method is shown through embodied ritual (kneeling, listening, placing the valve) rather than label-speak; her patience is dramatized, not declared. Interior contradiction arrives when each returned valve re-awakens private guilt about the exile she survived—yet this stays subtextual. The final micro-choice—handing the reassembled trumpet to the girl—crystallizes her value hierarchy: memory over anonymity, repair over archival purity. Cost is visible: the valve leaves her custody, severing her exclusive claim to the past.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s mapper identity is embodied early—kneeling, tracing, ledger—but the interior contradiction (order vs. craving mystery) is asserted more than dramatized until the final ticket choice. The embodied tremor is present, yet the emotional cost of abandoning his ledger-compass is only implied, not felt in muscle or breath. Micro-choices (slide punch, accept blank ticket) align with motive, but the woman’s pressure is off-stage; we see compliance, not crucible. Earned stasis is credible, but the price is named, not lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interiority is concrete—breath fogging glass, quill cramping—yet her skeptic→wonder shift is slightly under-cooked: the tile’s first memory-dump is accepted with only a generic “heart racing,” no embodied contradiction. Aelia’s courage is relayed as retrospective summary rather than dramatized micro-choice, so the kinship feels inferred, not pressured. Still, the final pocketing of the tile is a tangible, cost-carrying endurance that earns its quiet poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s ennui is viscerally embodied in the amulet-touching ritual and the rare hitch of breath; the mirrored “hollow Kael” crystallizes the cost of stasis. Lira’s entrance, however, is pure function—no contradictory impulse or micro-choice beyond exposition—so the relationship never becomes a crucible. The final leap is credibly motivated by the prior image of self-annihilation, giving us a paid-cost renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is sharp—her risk calculus, sensory memory of the ink, and hierarchy of values (asylum > truth > pride) all surface in micro-choices. The “honest child of a con” contradiction is shown, not labeled, when she tastes the ink she once only smuggled. Cost is visible: she trades the scroll she worships for papers that still leave her fugitive. Yet the agents’ flat villainy and Mr. Harrow’s sudden capitulation blunt relational pressure, keeping the score below the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Althea’s “earnestly studious” posture is embodied early—calloused fingers, violet-pine paste, notepad as sacred text—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a scene-forced choice. The beat where the lamp’s hum “unlocks” histories is passive observation; she writes rather than risks, so the promised cost of invention is felt only as writerly euphoria. No path is foreclosed; the climax is an expansion, not a renunciation or trade-off, so the arc plateaus at fascination rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus/Kael’s synesthetic perception is vividly embodied (“the violet of regret in a widow’s veil”) and directly steers his scavenging choices, turning each fragment into a micro-choice that edges him toward reclaimed identity. The locket moment crystallizes a credible before/after with felt cost: “He pressed the locket to his chest, its metal cold…”—a tactile renunciation of the Kael persona. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; a hair more counter-impulse mid-scene would have pushed to 8+. Still, the arc from erased void to named vengeance is cleanly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her coined term “gloomy cheerfulness” crystallizes her contradiction. The shell-on-bridge micro-choice visibly risks her composure, earning the final renunciation of pure logic. No stock therapy-speak; even “universal riddle” is filtered through her skepticism. The visible cost: she shoulders the cello’s fragile body and an unfinished melody, literalizing her acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—preserve soul vs appease suits—surfaces early and drives the graffiti-map plan, but the final stance crystallizes in a single declarative line (“You can’t privatize that”) rather than a pressured micro-choice; the chip’s tactile presence recurs yet never actively constrains her tactics. Emotion stays embodied in soot-smudged Jax and the torch gesture, giving the ending a collective rather than personal cost. The absence of a visible private concession keeps the arc just shy of earned renunciation territory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s yearning to “outlast indifference” is tangible, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“mirror, reflecting humanity’s fleeting presence”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. The sand-grain act is a clear micro-choice, yet the emotional cost feels declared, not embodied—no bodily stress or sensorial degradation under vacuum. Curiosity is asserted, not tested by contradiction; she never hesitates or recalculates, so stakes flatten. The final smile is unearned because the story summarizes rather than dramatizes her relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s tactile “sight” and her mother’s lullaby ground a blind artisan whose competence is balanced by visible struggle; the servo-recalibration choice costs her dawn’s triumph and she feels the drone’s new balance in her palm. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic labels, and the micro-choice to trust water-light over logic crystallizes values. Marlow functions as secondary pressure, his cane-creak status cue nudging her stance. The earned stasis—another drone already waiting—carries quiet cost: the work never ends.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s interiority is vivid—her finger on condensation, her half-buried grin under snow—yet the final beat slips into thematic summary (“Maps are lies”) rather than a palpable cost. The renunciation is implicitly earned, but the absence of a visible body-price in the last image keeps her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s “infinitely patient” trait is shown through concrete ritual (fork to ground, days of listening), embodying the trait rather than labeling it. His final renunciation—walking away after the bells ring—carries earned cost: he revives the town but forfeits belonging, a trade-off seeded by his lifelong solitude. Interiority stays sparse yet specific (“his chest ache” at the first clapper-strike). The only drag is near-absence of contradictory impulse; patience never wobbles, so the arc feels foreordained rather than chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her gloved fingers scraping algae, the vial pressed to her mask—yet the “harness the ephemeral” motive is stated rather than dramatized in earlier beats. The override of instinct is shown once, at the vial’s stubborn stopper, and carries cost when she absorbs the priests’ grief, but the epiphany that “time couldn’t be escaped” arrives as explanatory summary, softening the final renunciation. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout; only the late articulation of motive keeps this shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory tug—need to outrun paternal deceit yet echo his storytelling—drives every beat; the twin-figure moment crystallizes this. Interiority stays embodied (“lattice’s edges biting into his palm”). Final renunciation of corpse-hunt for self-authored story costs him certainty and is cued by prior hallucinated twin. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ghost bride’s interior contradiction—simultaneous yearning to release and to wound—surfaces only in abstract diction; the only embodied micro-choice in-scene is Elara lifting the bead to the fruit. The story relies on summarized backstory rather than present-tense action to expose motive, so the venomous-love tension is declared, not dramatized. Her final dissolution is earned by prior causality, but we never see a moment of visible cost or hesitation that crystallizes her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—poetic reverence vs. pragmatic mending—surfaces in her raw fingers and backward walk, but the “hauntingly optimistic” trait is declared more than dramatized; no visible error compounds ruin-to-reverence zeal, yet the final smile feels lightly earned because no prior beat tests that optimism to a break-point.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s returnee motive is dramatized through micro-choices—fitting the sundial, speaking to bones—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a single risky decision; the final “choice to follow” is voiced, not embodied. Backstory blocks are anchored and brief, yet the emotional cost stays lightly sketched. Enough for pressure, not yet for flaw-driven compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s contradictory blend of cerebral detachment and emotional hunger is dramatized through micro-choices (tracing chalk, trembling fingers, the decision to teach children). The grandmother reveal supplies a potent interior shift, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because the prior emotional stakes were stated in abstract “ghost-chasing” terms rather than embodied loss. Interiority avoids label-speak and maintains a consistent perceptual signature tied to decoding. Motive intensifies cleanly to the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zara’s contradictory impulses—obedient recorder vs. clandestine plotter—surface in the micro-choice to expose the mutable chart to Jaxon; the trembling needle and laugh embody simultaneous fear and defiance. Jaxon functions as pressure conduit rather than full crucible, but his shift from dismissive to awed supplies credible external mirror. Final “earned stasis” holds: she keeps stitching under heavier shadow, cost felt in the candle-lit silence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s want—recovering unspoken words—anchors every beat, but interiority tilts toward poetic commentary (“cryptic medium,” “fierce tenderness”) rather than on-page contradiction; the shard warms and smoothes as tactile micro-choice, yet no interior impulse clashes with the act, so the beat advances texture more than psyche. Reflection blocks (peatsong, cathedral memory) stay ≤20% and cue present stimuli, satisfying BRR, but the single decisive micro-choice—kneeling to read leaf-messages—restates motive rather than testing it; cost is atmospherically implied, not dramatized, capping full authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s “shrewdly innocent” paradox is dramatized in the moment she touches the coral and then again when she places it on the table; both beats show contradictory impulses in-scene and carry a visible cost (risk of appearing naïve vs. need to broker hope). Interiority stays concrete—coral ridges bite, mist swallows words—without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—offering the coral as talisman—grows directly from earlier micro-choices and forecloses her earlier stance of passive translation. Only the general’s single-line reaction keeps this from full 9-band integration; we’re told, not shown, his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—grief for the orchard vs. the giddy spark the fresco ignites—are rendered in concrete micro-choices (scavenging, painting with stolen sunbeams, pocketing the shard). Interiority is tactile, not diagnostic: “the fog clung…like a second skin.” The final renunciation of elegy for carnival is earned, but the cost is stated more than felt; a single sharper forfeiture (a prism left behind, a mirror cracked) would nail the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marisol’s curiosity and tactile engagement with pigment and coin are vivid; her interior contradiction (yearn for answers vs. fear of erasure) pulses in the moment the mural breathes. The final “rhythm of awakening” renunciation is earned because every micro-choice (angling the dish, pocketing the nickel) visibly closes her prior detachment. Grandfather’s absence is felt, not exposited, giving the arc quiet cost. Still, the emotional peak is slightly underplayed—no bodily register of grief or awe at seeing his era’s dancer—keeping her just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation—guarding “your own spark of defiance”—is declared rather than dramatized; we never see him risk anything tangible or feel a concrete loss. His interiority is limited to grinning and quoting poetry, so the contradictory impulses that would make the final garden reveal feel earned are missing. Lillian functions as a gatekeeper rather than a crucible, so the relationship pressure bullet is moot. The “earned place” moment is too smooth: the moths point, the club applauds, no visible cost is exacted for entry.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—writing as both shield and hoped-for bridge—is vivid and embodied. The centuries-long arc is compressed into lyrical summary, so the micro-choices that would make each tonal shift fully legible are elided; still, her trembling hands and the sleeping/not-sleeping toggle give enough corporeal cost to earn the final renunciation. The flaw: we are told the insomnia “faded” rather than shown the exact beat where surrender costs her something visible. Fits Accumulative lens; character depth sustains mood, but lacks one crystallized decision under pressure that would punch into 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s caretaker-caregiver contradiction drives every beat: her oath to freeze feelings collides with her refusal to let the chime die. Embodied micro-choices—tracing the crack, dismantling the chime, risking orchid bloom—show systemic method warped into creative transgression. The earned renunciation of pure preservation lands as personal cost when she accepts a “new harmony” that leaks extinct joy and grief into the air. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, trembling petals and her own tight chest externalize the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “carefully reckless” tag fuels two visible micro-choices—risking Henrik’s scorn to chase the letter, staying overnight to finish—each with page-cost (stiff back, emptied ink well). Interiority is concrete when she “traces the spine” and tastes mead residue, but the sister silence/backstory is delivered in two expository lumps that mute contradiction-in-scene. The final phone call is a decisive, earned renunciation of avoidance, yet the sister remains off-page, so the relationship-as-crucible pressure is implied, not staged. Still, flaws stay minor; the river/dam metaphor is lived, not labeled, and the glass well’s dwindling ink bodies the price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the chain, the thrill of the chase vibrating “through her bones”—but the emotional stakes remain abstract. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she simply decrypts and smiles. The grandfather memory is a single reflective spike, not a compounding flaw. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and profession-specific details (geological cipher, brass links) anchor her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory motives—guilt over the family lie and hunger for the truth—are kept alive in every beat; the reinvention trait directly shapes his refusal to stay a mere courier. Interiority is concrete (fingers trembling on the harness, chest tightening at the lullaby memory). The renunciation of the safe courier life to walk toward the coast is earned by the dust-mote map and taped song; cost is felt. Flaw drives plot: his obsessive secrecy delays action, letting clients slip away, a credible stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is evocative (“featherly determined”) and her micro-choices (tracing grain, reading codes) track, yet her emotional engine stays reactive; the logbook and codes are handled more than they complicate her. The final “walk on” is credible renunciation, but the on-page cost (loss of terrace, father’s regret) is felt only through his single line—hers remains abstract. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the maze heart arrives as revelation, not tested dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s interiority drifts into atmospheric summary (“a feeling she’d long associated with the surface world”) rather than embodied contradiction. The burnt feather is handled twice but never tests or crystallizes a decision; her final stance is acceptance without visible cost. No micro-choice under pressure tightens her state; she observes, then smiles. Lacks earned stasis or charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “cheerful gloom” is embodied in humming that dissolves into sighs—but the moment of interior contradiction (the micro-choice of pressing seeds into the shard) is under-dramatized; we are told her stance changes rather than watching her body betray her. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira’s analytical lens is credibly threaded—she counts trajectories and times her dissonant note to drop the spoon. The bishop piece does double duty as tactile anchor and symbolic shorthand for strategic art, but the interiority never complicates her stance; she stays calmly above the fray, muting the cost she supposedly extracts from others. The teen’s tattoo and five-dollar tip sketch a follower, not a crucible, so the relationship axis reads thin. A single, embodied contradiction—her fingers trembling as the bishop vibrates—would have vaulted her into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lirael’s ache for renewal is concrete (fading constellations on her skin) and every micro-gesture (pressing dust to collarbone, burning stylus strokes) externalizes her contradictory needs to fledge and anchor. The spontaneous-anchor trait is not merely labeled: it physically limits her leaps and forces her to dance in tension with gravity, so the body-as-crucible test is met. No interior diagnostic clichés; pain is felt, not explained. The final stance—elective exile in the in-between—is credibly foreclosed by the cost glimpsed in the garden’s retreat and the verse’s fading glow.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her calloused hands, the prism’s weight, the chill biting ankles—but the “need to commune” remains abstract; no contradictory impulse surfaces to test her. The only micro-choice is tossing the stone, a low-stakes ritual that never endangers her want or reveals a flaw. The notebook jotting is a summary label, not an embodied cost; the arc is a serene confirmation rather than a change. The reflective lens stays surface-level; we never feel what she might lose by seeing or not seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s survivor-guilt and mother-haunting are vivid, but the interiority drifts into thematic self-explanation (“he realized…”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The hourglass moment crystallizes change, yet the cost feels pre-assigned by the note, not earned by a micro-choice that risks anything tangible now. Voice remains individual; scar and porcelain read as lived-in extensions of self.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Driven, interior contradiction isn’t dramatized—her need “to puzzle out new equations for hope” is declared, not tested against a counter-impulse. Micro-choices (thread tension, silver strand from her own hair) are present and specific, but the cost of failure or the price of continuing is only implied. Closure is Charged Poise rather than renunciation, so a deeper flaw-driven stake is not required, yet the absence of any visible self-interrogation keeps her just shy of high-band interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s curiosity about “what walls dream” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this matters beyond filial piety—stays abstract. The moment she chooses to burn the film strip is a micro-choice with cost, yet the emotional hierarchy (why erase rather than keep?) isn’t embodied beforehand. No genuine flaw complicates the choice; the risk feels aesthetic, not personal. Voice remains coherent, but the arc leans toward discovery rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s grief-linked motive is clear and embodied in the locket, but her interiority repeats “perceptively calm” instead of letting contradiction tear her. The sister-image is vivid yet never complicates Lirael’s choices mid-scene; she executes the plan flawlessly, so no flaw drives a visible cost. The ending renunciation is implied, not dramatized—she simply walks away—so the earned price feels withheld from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“operatively gentle” hands, the clipboard pressed like a shield—yet her contradictory impulse (cling to ritual vs. concede imperfect peace) stays legible only in summary, not simultaneous scene tension. The final “heart heavy yet hopeful” is diagnostic shorthand that blunts cost; still, her endurance carries visible price and earns stasis under the Accumulative lens. Secondary delegates remain placeholders, but single-POV default holds. Micro-choices (finger tapping rhythm, tight smile) show hierarchy of values; flaw complicates without tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Contradictory impulses—profit vs. extinct-bird nostalgia—are dramatized in the egg-handling, the secret nightly recordings, and the final poured vial; each micro-choice costs him social-moral capital and forecloses the path back to pure cynicism. Interiority stays concrete (“the egg’s shell was iridescent, a ghostly blue that shimmered like a mirage”) and avoids label-speak. The Earned Stasis—he walks away without verifying the egg, already planning the resort—pays off the earlier sentimentality with visible self-inflicted loss. Voice remains singular, amorality uncompensated; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lirael’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—“unspoken truths,” “living archive”—so her motives feel declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the dance is pure resolve, never doubt. Still, her body-as-loom is consistent, and the ending’s lighter gait shows a visible cost of effort. Enough specificity to hit the 7-line but not the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt over the tycoon eulogy is cleanly anchored in present ritual, and his micro-choice to reverse the puppet roles crystallizes the ethical question with felt cost—his quiet “Exactly. Half-truths are the only kind worth telling” is a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, not diagnostic, and the serenity trait modulates under crowd pressure without flattening. The beat-count is thin for full transformation, but the earned stasis lands.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s quiet, almost monastic devotion is rendered with tactile reverence—knees in moss, silk between fingers—but her interiority cycles the same paraphrased credo (“transiently rooted,” “ephemeral monuments”) without ever dramizing a moment where that creed is truly tested or shaken. The moth wing stirs awe yet never becomes a crucible; her final “peace” is asserted more than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s grief-scarred silence and “technically gentle” hands are embodied in every tactile beat; the micro-choice to keep weaving despite tremors shows interior contradiction under pressure. The final image of raw but steady hands earns the Earned Stasis closure. Yet the mother’s apparition speaks with therapeutic certainty (“You’ve found me”), a hairline slip that softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s “precisely playful” analyst-artist duality is shown through concrete gestures—tracing the wafer, pocketing the warm seal—yet most interiority is narrated summary (“her thoughts raced”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic recognition that foresight and hindsight are twin lenses is declared, not dramatized; we are told she “understood” rather than shown a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Still, her arc from decoding relics to becoming the directive’s architect is clear, and the final image of her dancing with storms retroactively pays for her earlier passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s frugality is more than back-story; it governs her micro-choices (bartering wages, kneeling to brush sand herself) and sharpens the final refusal to treat knowledge as coin. Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs hunger for transcendence—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The mentor’s death is the only interior block; it is concrete, brief, and quickly tied to her present hunger for pattern. Closure is an earned renunciation: she swears by curiosity itself, a visible cost that forecloses easier mercenary uses of the tile.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s “scheming pacifist” profile is vividly anchored in the opening paragraph—her mind “sharp as flint and heart soft as moss” crystallizes the paradox and every subsequent micro-choice flows from it. Interiority stays embodied (the vial drawn from her own blood) and her value hierarchy is legible: risk self to gift release. The only flaw is that the final beat with Kael re-states the thesis rather than revealing a new contradiction, so the cost feels slightly pre-announced instead of discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s calm artisan persona is vivid, but his interior contradiction—yearning to breach the unseen yet fearing the cost—never crystallizes in a single, pressured micro-choice; the final gift of the etched mirror feels generous, not wrested from a visible internal split. The stranger’s urgency is palpable yet remains a narrative device; his mirrored breathing partnership never forces Elias to risk a concrete forfeiture. Earned stasis is hinted at when Elias turns the sextant inward, but the cost is asserted rather than embodied. Still, the steady accumulation of sensory labor keeps characterization above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s grief-linked stubbornness is vivid in embodied beats (ribbon flutter, copper wire burn), but daughter Mara stays off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only recalled. Interiority drifts into thematic paraphrase (“mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures…”) that flattens contradiction. The decision to keep climbing tomorrow is credible endurance, yet the cost feels generalized; no specific flaw boomerangs. Characterization is strong-bordering-exceptional, but the epiphanic shorthand keeps it just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “simply complicated” label is shown more than told: her obsessive pursuit of forbidden knowledge collides with the board’s warning and her own trembling hands. Interiority stays specific—she catalogues relics but crumbles at her own past—yet the emotional cost of pressing the cameo into the tree is declared rather than embodied in a final beat. Still, her contradictory impulses (hunger vs. fear) remain active in scene and the final choice forecloses the museum path with visible institutional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test within the length cap.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to salvage her life’s work through forbidden knowledge is vivid; her willingness to admit ignorance at the mirror-door is a credible, costly shift. Micro-choices—humming the childhood tune, pocketing the orchid—embody her resourceful, obsessive nature. Flaw: we’re told Kael is “wild” but he never acts it on-page, so the relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—hope vs. Veyra’s scorn—stays embodied (card-clutch, wing-brush) and drives the descent. The final micro-choice to sew their joint name into soil crystallizes a hierarchy of values (memory > escape) with visible cost: the ship dissolves behind them. No diagnostic speak, no stock labels; flaws complicate rather than decorate. Antler-nudge and serpentine tail keep bodies legible throughout; status shift from skeptic to co-planter is understated but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “archivist” label is vivid—she handles ink, seal, and parchment in tactile beats—and her braided-rope micro-choice directly re-opens the door, so agency is visible. Yet her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“translate chaos into order”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction; the final beat shows no new flaw cost, only a tidy self-coronation as “weaver of timelines,” so the change feels announced, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is textured through bodily resonance (“her ribs ache”) and micro-choices (pressing the stone to the spiral). Her flaw—obsessive attunement to lost sound—drives every beat and is paid for in physical pain and exhausted stillness at the end. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the single-POV arc is credible and fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift vs. stubborn hope—drives every tactile micro-choice (bleeding fingers, shard-alignment). The final renunciation of needing the stars fully returned is earned by persistent embodied cost and crystallizes her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lirael’s shift from passive recorder to active participant is embodied in her kneeling to trace shadows and feel the crystal’s hum; the final decision to leave the archive and “let her own story unfold” carries earned cost. Interiority stays concrete—her palm on frosted glass, vibration in her bones—avoiding label-speak. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets N/A. The only drag: “preemptively nostalgic” is declared early but never complicates a mid-scene choice with visible trade-off, keeping the arc tidy rather than contradiction-laced.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s guilt-driven quest and her mentor-shaped “filter” reflex give her a sharp, embodied interior life; every micro-choice (touching apron hem, kerosene knot flare, chant cadence) is character-specific and advances her climb from shame to self-ignition. The only drag is a late, slightly abstract epiphany—“shadows aren’t darkness but unlit potential”—that is told more than dramatized, blunting the cost ledger a hair. Still, her flaws combust into the final stance with credible fire-craft logic and earned upward spin.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to record vs. need to connect—survives one beat; the embodied “cold seep” and micro-choice of rotating the cicada show motive in scene. Yet the later shift to talking-about rather than living the conflict (“I’ve been thinking about the cicada”) lets diagnostic label-speak leak in, softening the cost. Kael’s passive acceptance lacks a status push that would force her to pay visibly. The final stance is credible but not irreversible; the path foreclosed feels gently, not painfully, shut.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s hunger for “flavors of silence” is embodied from the first breath of rust to the final sprout; her contradictory impulses—cling to the doll vs. let it go—activate simultaneously in the weightless hatch beat, giving the renunciation bite. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial, never drifting into label-speak. The micro-choice to release the doll costs her the only relic of the old world, earning the closing sprout and a credible shift from claustrophobia to hopeful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her shoulders carry tension, her breath catches, her grip tilts the vial—but the “teach silence how to comfort” motive is declared rather than dramatized as a contradiction she must act out. No secondary character appears, so status crucible and voice distinction are N/A; micro-choices (tilting the vial, rerouting tomorrow) are present yet low-stakes because no live passenger or social cost is risked on-page. The earned insight is credible, but the cost is purely internal and intellectual; the story never forces her to gamble reputation, income, or safety, so the closure feels lightly rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—spectacles, ruby flake, murmur—yet the “wisely adventurous” label is asserted not dramatized; the final self-recognition is earned but the bones-of-failures mural is skimmed, reducing felt cost. Still, her micro-choice to question, not fight, crystallizes values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—self-protective isolation vs the need to re-connect—are dramatized in concrete gestures (hand on cold ring, trembling fingers brushing Kael’s shadow). The “tender shadow keeper” label stays mostly ornamental; her interiority slips into diagnostic shorthand (“emptiness had become a cage”) rather than embodied contradiction at the climax. Still, her final grip on Kael’s hand crystallizes a credible micro-choice that costs her prior absolutism, earning a modest but visible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s pyramid-scheme past is sketched via label (“knack for spotting lies”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction; the turn of the bolt is plausibly “mischievous,” but interior cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, her wary competence under pressure is consistent and the final grin lands as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is rich—her “fingers tracing the rim,” the tremor in her chest—but the dynastic motive never collides with a present-tense dilemma that would force a visible micro-choice; the emotional turn is epiphanic rather than embodied. The letters give her knowledge, not an on-page refusal or cost; the dynasty ender choice is announced, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cedric’s muteness and fixation on the program give a concrete wound; the final laugh and blank program page show earned release. Interiority leans on abstract tags (“shivering bliss,” “motivation crystallized”) rather than embodied contradiction, muting full pressure. Still, his micro-choice to snap the strings and descend carries visible cost—armor gone, world remade—so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s ache is palpable in embodied details—finger on the folder, breath catching—but the promised “contradictory impulses” never collide in-scene; he observes rather than chooses until the final quiet vow. The interiority is rich yet static; no micro-choice risks anything before the last sentence, so the arc is more mood than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s scrapper backstory is vivid, but her interior contradiction—yearning to prove worth yet fearing failure—only surfaces in label-speak (“she’d prove them wrong”). The key-as-father relic and the lagoon’s sensory chokehold nicely externalize motive; still, no micro-choice in the climax visibly prices her flaw—she escapes unscarred, so the renunciation feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—hush a coded prophecy—grounds every choice; his interiority stays concrete (“his lungs burning,” “saxophone warm”). The final renunciation carries visible cost: exhaustion, dew-mirrors, lingering uncertainty. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets NA. One slip: “strange peace” edges toward unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elinor’s seed-sorting precision and tactile care are vivid, but interiority stays safe; the moonstone prod is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her prior skepticism. Folklore shift from dismissive to believer happens off-stage, so the decisive stance change feels lightly earned. Still, her embodied ritual—tracing light with calloused thumb—anchors a credibly solitary, vocation-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession and tactile tinkering are vivid; the contradictory impulse to impose order yet embrace randomness is dramatized in the final image. Interiority stays concrete (“grinding his teeth,” “laughing…echoing off the cave walls”). The renunciation of certainty is earned, but the middle flashback block is pure reflective summary—no on-page micro-choice—so the arc’s hinge feels slightly floated rather than pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s grief-grafted drive is palpable; the coin-drop moment crystallizes his need to act. Interiority is concrete (molten-metal ache, soot-streaked memory). Yet the sister’s appearance is accepted too calmly—no embodied shock, no contradictory reflex—so the emotional leap feels slightly performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—fear that laughter may be insufficient—drives the single decisive beat when she offers the tooth; the embodied chill and throat-ache keep emotion concrete. Modest fearlessness shows in the unflinching walk and the final lighter-heart beat, but the “quiet resolve that burned like a candle in a storm” drifts toward label-speak and is never tested by a visible mistake or loss. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; occupation as soul-collector is color, not crucible here. The choice to wield the tooth for translation is earned, forecloses the ghost’s challenge, and carries felt cost via the pulsing relic—just enough for 8-band, capped at 7.8 by the soft epiphany phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clutching the torture-strap while craving mercy—grounds every beat; the embodied PTSD (UV spores burn like needle-light) keeps emotion specific. Micro-choice chain (presses forehead to pulsing bark → catches slipping strap → exhales spores) steadily tilts his stance from quantifying forgiveness to accepting unmeasurable choice. Final “I’m bracing” crystallizes Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of numerical absolution with the strap still splitting his palm—cost felt, not lectured. Voice stays coherent, never slides into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s translator gift is concrete from line 1; she *must* decipher runes, then *must* match starlight vials to memories. Interior contradiction arrives mid-mural when childhood recollection and present breath-rhythm collide, forcing her hand to the crack—choice is embodied, not declared. Cost is tactile: the shard’s “sharp yet soft” edge cuts her palm memory, a price felt at once. The arc is a single, earned release of memory reclaimed; no epiphany clutter. Voice stays hers alone; the weaver’s status is readable in silver eyes and parchment push, never explained.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with ghosts is shown through tactile micro-choices—pressing forehead to metal, pocketing the mainspring—rather than labels; the final moment of shared weight with the clown ghost crystallizes a believable, earned endurance rather than tidy growth. Interiority stays concrete and profession-shaded; only the “second skin” line flirts with cliché. The lack of any second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relationship crucible off the table, but solitary POV is coherent. Closure is a renunciation-repair stance whose cost is felt in his trembling legs and the cold hand on his shoulder.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“she believed,” “she knew the risk”—but we never inhabit her body under duress; the rupture is watched from outside, so the final smile feels reported rather than paid for. Her motivation stays coherent, yet the absence of a visible cost on her person keeps the arc just short of earned. The spiral choice is causally clean, but the emotional price is displaced onto the collective, muting her crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motive to expose a stolen past is clear and emotionally grounded; the “burnished sorrow” registers in embodied beats like wrapping the shard “like a relic.” Interior contradiction is sketched (revolutionary turned archaeologist) but the turn is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. Micro-choices (draping mirrors, planting fungi) visibly enact values, yet no moment forces him to risk present safety for the truth, so the arc feels incremental rather than costly. The final stance is legible but leans on poetic assertion, not a crucible choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority stays concrete—goggles, finger on grooves, tool names—yet never slips into cliché. His micro-choices (needle into mainspring, palm to wall) visibly wager competence against the stone’s moral infection, so the final “smile” feels earned. Lira’s single contradiction—clenched hands vs. stepping closer—gives her enough presence for a two-character crucible at this length. No stock therapeutic labels; even “cowardice” is pinned to the husband off-stage, keeping diagnostic speak out of peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s curiosity, eccentricity, and collector’s compulsion are shown through tactile beats—cataloguing jars, palming the compass, kneeling to read rock—so motives remain embodied. Internal contradiction (scientist vs mystic) is hinted but never pressed to a visible micro-choice under the lagoon pressure; the final “hunger” is declared, not dramatized. Still, her steady attention and sensory filtering feel idiosyncratic and alive, sustaining single-POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and driftwood-sculptor identity threads every perception; contradiction is mostly absent until the late epiphany, so the final “Teach me” feels slightly unearned—no interior cost is dramatized on the page. Micro-choices (pressing slide to keystone, dropping sculptures) anchor agency, but the lack of visible hesitation or flaw keeps the arc just shy of high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “quietly driven” trait is shown through concrete, costly choices—creeping into the cathedral at night, climbing scaffolding, tracing patterns until her teeth ache. The contradiction between public mural duty and private obsession sharpens when she paints the shadows, not the jasmine, showing a visible pivot. Her grandmother’s echo (“reckon through the hidden layers”) seeds internal conflict that culminates in the final smile, paying the cost of accepting an unending mystery. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s archivist identity is embodied through ink-stained fingers and diary-obsessed choices; the retrocognitive cost is shown rather than told. The final refusal to seize the codex is a credible renunciation, but the interiority flirts with diagnostic shorthand (“her identity fraying”) instead of dramatized dissolution. Still, the micro-choice to hurl debris and descend is character-specific and pays visible cost. Fits 600-word scope, one POV, one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s refusal of false comfort is visible in his refusal to smash the bottle; the memory-as-alchemy method is dramatized through his scavenging and arranging, not merely declared. Contradictory impulses—hollow exhaustion vs. furious will—co-exist in the first beat and again when tears mix with salt spray, giving credible interior tension. Final endurance (bottle remains sealed) is foreshadowed by early rejection of easy exit, so the renunciation feels earned. Voice stays in his gaunt body; no label-speak slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elder Voss’s obsession with emotional archives is vivid, but his internal contradiction—preserver vs. prophet—stays verbal. The micro-choice to replay the shaving crystallizes stance, yet we are told rather than shown the bodily cost of that decision; the smile at the end feels unearned because no prior flaw is punished. Diagnostic label “皱纹” in parenthesis yanks us out of his POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her ear pricks, her brow furrows, her hands ache—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. duty) stay verbalized rather than enacted in split-second body choice. The moment she “grins” at the sharper bell tone instantly shows embodied emotion, but the later stance shift back to “humble” reads more label than cost. No genuine flaw complicates her final maestro beat; the cost is atmospheric, not personal, so the arc feels competent rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zara’s interiority is rich—calloused hands, dawn-glass lantern, spiritual curiosity—but the “cosmic janitor” tag never constrains or enables a concrete choice; her walk to the crater reads as poetic inevitability, not a micro-choice under pressure. The final smile at Veyra is the first visible cost, so renunciation is earned, yet the emotional arc leans on abstract empathy rather than a forked decision with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s solitude-sought silence turns to compelled speech at the climax, a credible renunciation of his life-long stance; the shift is prepared by steady interiority (“the weight of unspoken words”) and micro-choices at the box. Emotions stay embodied (trembling hands, breath catching) rather than diagnostic. The only gap: we never see a moment where silence costs him something concrete before the ghosts arrive—his flaw is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—frayed cufflinks, palm on cold wall, the urn fragment’s weight—yet his emotional turns hinge on abstract realizations (“time wasn’t absence but layering”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation is credible: he walks away lighter, numbers now meaningless, carrying the cost of having seen his wife’s laugh. Still, the micro-choice that triggers the climax—placing the shard beside the coil—reads more symbolic than driven by a prior, legible stake. Enough contradiction pulses to satisfy the 9- gate, but not with the seamless cost-charge required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s interiority is textured—bare feet skimming water, fingers tracing feather barbs—but her motives stay lyrically abstract (“harmonize the world’s discord”) rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses. She makes only one micro-choice midway: wading in, feeling “truth.” That moment is too summary to expose cost or flaw; the fisherman’s nod is external validation rather than crucible pressure. Earned stasis is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s “brazen calm” is repeatedly named but never contradicted; no interior friction or competing impulse is dramatized, so her final acceptance feels pre-scripted rather than earned. The six-month death sentence is declared, yet no beat shows her fatigue, fear, or tactical recalculation—she remains serenely competent throughout. The copper-wrapping micro-choices are tactile but flatten into ritual; they never force her to question, improvise, or relinquish anything. Closure still lands with visible cost (her death), so the arc reaches Earned Stasis, but the absence of internal struggle keeps the score just below the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s skeptical drive is concrete (refusing Kael’s guidance, placing the amber), but her emotional shift from intellectual detachment to “familiar longing” is declared rather than embodied; the interior contradiction is asserted after the amber dissolves instead of being dramatized under pressure. Kael functions as explanatory foil, never exerting status pressure that forces Lirael to recalibrate values on the page. No visible cost for the insight—she laughs, rain stops, no path foreclosed—so the change feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—'the narrow vastness of hope'—and micro-choices (scattering pods, listening to gull) embody the arc. No second character onstage, so status/relationship bullets off. Flaw: motivation stays static; he ends where he began, so the ‘earned cost’ is only the dawn ride away, not a sharpened renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    Hush’s nose-as-reader is a fresh conceit, but the story tells us she “bark[s] once, and the settlement erupt[s]” rather than dramatizing a visible, costly choice. Interiority is asserted (“she seemed to say”) rather than embodied. Motive is declared early but never tested under pressure; no contradiction or forfeiture accrues. The dog remains symbol more than agent, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elio’s interior contradiction—yearning for exile yet aching for direction—remains embodied in trembling ink and fist-around-compass. The grandmother visitation externalizes his split, but her dialogue drifts into prompt-speak (“Confusion is just exploration’s first draft”), blunting the emotional edge. Closure earns a credible renunciation: he steps through an unmapped door, compass hot, confusion now accepted as engine—cost legible, choice his.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “chivalrous thief” label is declared, not dramatized; no greedy victim or needy beneficiary appears on stage, so the trait stays ornamental. Interiority is limited to heroic self-talk (“guardian of wonder”) without contradictory impulse or embodied cost. The only micro-choice—swap the king—succeeds frictionlessly, so no flaw compounds and no earned renunciation occurs. The arc is static competence, not tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s survivor-guilt interiority is vivid (“quiet weight… mimic grief so well she forgot where art ended”), but the “benevolently ruthless” trait is asserted rather than dramatized—no moment shows her harming someone kindly. The pawn = herself epiphany lands cleanly, yet the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. Still, contradiction under pressure (walking vs. gallery whispers) keeps her above stock.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s need to grasp “the shape of home” is concrete from the first paragraph and every beat grows from it; her embodied silver skin and feather-touch micro-choice show contradictory impulses in scene. The final endurance—accepting obsidian shards—pays the visible cost and re-prices her identity. Interiority stays specific: “mercury skin substituted reality” not abstract “I felt lost.” The mother’s apparition is handled as remembered voice, not convenient on-stage helper, so motivation remains character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Alaric’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are viscerally embodied in the black-thread memory; the ring-fidget micro-choice recurs under pressure and links directly to the pedagogical reframing at the end. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and the final “weight lifting” is earned by the on-page unravelling of threads. Flaw: the prince’s last look is the only moment we feel two contradictory impulses simultaneously; elsewhere the emotional layering is sequential rather than concurrent, keeping this just shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s defiance is vivid, but interiority stays on-theme rather than in-body; the single contradictory beat (“the price of forgiveness wasn’t submission—it was the courage to let go”) is declared, not dramatized with embodied cost. His micro-choice to paint “Forgive” is visible, yet the shift from prank to sacrificial stance is summarized, not felt under pressure. The elders’ one-note villainy flattens the crucible, so the status swing lands as concept, not relationship change.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s uncertainty is embodied through trembling hands, masked breath, and the choice to remove the respirator—each action costs. The final renunciation lands because the charm’s hum and the acid’s mirror have already forced her to confront her own cracks. Interiority stays concrete; “quilt memories together” is shown via the constellation map that reweights her past. The only drag: the line “Kintsugi isn’t about perfection” is diagnostic label-speak amid an otherwise visceral beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s nostalgic painter identity is vivid—salt-smudged fingers, harbor light, sketchbook reflex—yet his interior contradiction (restlessness vs. vow never to return) stays summary until the cavern pool. The shell’s weight and the mirror crack serve as external proxies for inner fracture, but we don’t feel the embodied tug-of-war until he kneels; earlier beats are coasting on label (“the world was fraying, and so was he”). The final letting-go is credible because the drawing act is already established, so the renunciation carries cost, but the emotional crescendo is slightly front-loaded on exposition rather than simultaneous contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to be heard yet terrified of shouting—are embodied in the trembling vial and the low hum she dares release; the micro-choice to exhale her swallowed words into glass is specific, irreversible, and carries the felt cost of possible ridicule. Thalos as secondary pressure works: his unexpected complicity re-casts the garden from ornamental to instrumental, forcing Elara to revise her taxonomy of allies. The endurance smile in rain, tears, and silence is a credible renunciation: she accepts that proof may never be acknowledged, yet the beacon inside the cork now burns for her alone. Only minor erosion: the fisherfolk reaction is summarized, not dramatized, so the social cost is slightly abstracted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority—“the geography of loss,” the tactile ritual with the censer foot—gives us a believable, idiosyncratic mind in scene. Contradictory impulse is present: she obeys disembodied voices while fearing their cost, yet the choice to weave her own hair into the antenna is a credible micro-choice that tilts values. The final stance crystallizes her hierarchy: summoning ghosts matters more than physical safety. Hairline slip: “raw solace” is diagnostic self-label, not embodied, but it sits outside a peak beat so damage is capped.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s “rational” label is asserted, not shown; her interiority is thin and generic (“her heart sinking,” “her mind racing”). The glass-eye insertion is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her, momentarily sharpening perception—strong, but it’s the solitary beat where contradiction, embodied emotion, and visible cost coincide. Relationship with Jorn is sketched in paranoia rather than lived status moves, so the crucible effect is muted. Closure choice—“We occlude”—is declared, not dramatized; we don’t see her weigh or pay for it, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—grief-soaked obsession and reluctant caretaker—are embodied in the moth-wing petal, the lantern swing, the decision to open the trunk. The final renunciation (“I’ve carried enough”) is seeded early through his wife’s locket and pays off with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the woman’s hollowness leans on trope, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her glasses-squint, the chip’s weight in her palm, the heartbeat-water-drip sync. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—choosing the lived shop over the portal—is credibly rooted in the father-garden vision, so the cost is felt; still, the flaw-compounding promised by the rubric is only lightly present.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—her fear of irrelevance, the taste of iron, the damp sheets—but the climactic recognition (“you are not disenchanted, you are afraid”) is delivered by an external chorus rather than forced out by her own contradictory choices. No micro-choice on the ridge visibly tightens the screw; she climbs, listens, accepts, and leaves without a fresh wager or forfeiture. Earned stasis is hinted at but not paid for in an on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “scientifically romantic” lens feels particular, not pasted on. The micro-choice to place the shell atop the core rather than force it shows a credible shift under pressure. Jorin functions mostly as sounding-board; status dynamics stay flat, preventing 9+. Still, her flawed persistence and embodied trembling after past explosions earn the closure renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for past selves while hating their certainty—are dramatized in embodied beats (the limping climb, trembling hands). The final micro-choice to “shed the weight” is foreshadowed by the scroll’s imperative and costs him the safety of denial, earning a credible renunciation. Interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic self-labeling (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused”) that flattens immediacy, but the hierarchy of values is legible in the climb. Character remains individual, not archetype, though the jealousy mechanism is stated more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s anosmic synaesthesia—reading emotion through rusted tools—gives her a sharp, particular interiority; the micro-choice to polish and annotate the screw crystallizes her values. Yet the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the moment she connects “E” to Eleanor, so the decisive change feels lightly earned, not paid for under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, itching scars—but the decisive “I shed” moment is narrated rather than dramatized; the micro-choice of carving the second airborne rune is shown, yet the emotional pivot still leans on summary. Still, contradictory impulses (fear vs. craving clarity) coexist in real time under the platform’s shudder, and the glowing re-patterning of his scars supplies visible cost. Enough embodied tension to earn the shift, though the beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s sardonic pragmatism (“imperfect miracles require imperfect methods”) is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to upend the bottle while squeezing Elias’s shoulder crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she smells regret, fingers Braille-like spines—never drifts into label-speak. The enduring flaw (commodifying grief for copy) is never soft-hedged; the cost is felt when she admits the bottle now “felt heavier,” foreclosing her glib detachment. Missing 9.0 only because the shift from cynical prop-collector to co-exorcist is fractionally abrupt; one more preparatory beat of doubt would seal it.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Witness’s calm omnicompetence keeps interior contradiction off the page; every beat lands as serene declaration rather than embodied struggle. “Journeying inward while walking out” is announced but never dramatized with micro-choices that cost something now. The blank dictionary payoff is elegant, yet the inner path to it is summary, not staked craving or fear. What should be a crucible of self feels like a guided tour narrated by someone already enlightened.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lorn’s interiority is tactile—the filed key biting his palm, the backward count as a ritual—but his motives stay abstract: we’re told he “suspects” clocks measure silence, yet no contradictory impulse forces a visible trade-off. The climactic insight (“clocks measure longing”) is lovely but declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something on the page. Because the final stance is epiphany rather than irreversible action, the character beat feels slightly under-cooked for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s “spatially gifted” label is announced but never exploited under pressure; his only decisive move is to retune the laser to Lira’s voice frequency—an external prompt, not an earned interior turn. Interiority drifts into thematic paraphrases (“physics of letting go”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final nod is understated, but the cost of surrender is asserted rather than dramatized through bodily or relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s gambling itch and academic lineage are vividly anchored in the opening beats; her lantern-touch micro-choice under pressure (“grip tightened”) shows embodied contradiction. The interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final nod to visit her father is credible renunciation, but the beat is compressed to a single sentence—cost is felt yet could have carried more bodily weight.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s vocation as “connector” is crystalline, but interiority stays at a broadcasting level; we hear her philosophy (“cultivated estrangement”) more than private contradiction. No moment of personal cost or risk to her own isolation is dramatized, so her final smile feels curiously unearned. Micro-decisions (patching calls) are visible, yet they don’t tighten a private stakes screw; she remains a benevolent switchboard.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—dread that beauty fades vs. thrill that it might not—remains verbal, never crystallizes into a scene-level choice; the locket is caressed but never risked, so “preserve small moments” stays an abstraction rather than a costly act.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s “elusive” logistician tag is shown more than told—he dodges paperwork, vanishes from camps—but the interior contradiction between duty and evasion is only sketched, not dramatized under pressure. The moon-rock gift and geologist debt supply motive, yet that debt is asserted, not tested; we see no micro-choice where refusing the rock would cost him. Closure shows a felt softening of his chest-ache, so a minimal arc is legible, but the absence of a visible price paid keeps the change from feeling earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is sensorially rich—ring-borne vibrations replace sight, and every step is a tacticle choice. The final reunion is earned: he has paid with solitude, risk, and the map’s unstoppable trembling. No secondary character shares the scene, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. Micro-choices (kneeling to dig, wading the river) visibly foreclose retreat, satisfying cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt and “confidently uncertain” mantra give him a usable interior contradiction; the pen-as-key and humbled editor arc track cleanly. Lira functions mainly as oracle, not crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin. Final renunciation—handing the farmer back agency—lands with modest cost yet feels pre-explained rather than viscerally discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory pull—yearning to be remembered yet fearing exposure—drives every micro-gesture; the camera-touches and signed “listening” beat embody his grandmother-inherited flaw. The final smile costs him: he forfeits anonymity and accepts tomorrow’s amnesia, earning the quiet renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; “silence has a shape” is shown via fingertip choreography. One hairline slip: the fisherman’s late rough voice is the only voiced line, slightly diluting Kael’s deaf-universe texture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—destructive fire as tender rescue—stay active in every beat; the final tear-painted restoration crystallizes the cost of her promise. Interiority is concrete (“calloused hands,” “volcanic tenderness”) rather than diagnostic. The only slip is a slight over-articulation of the archive-as-garden metaphor in the grandmother’s quoted line, nudging toward thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    Eli’s scars and “quiet rebellion” give him a body-level hook, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“sorrow that felt borrowed”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. The moment he accepts the entanglement is gracefully embodied, yet the prior beats rely on declarative emotion (“I finally understood”) instead of micro-choices that cost him something visible. Relationship with the woman remains a gentle silhouette; no status shift or tension is legible between them, so the crucible test is only half-met. Overall, a promising arc of endurance, but the causality of his change is more announced than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—gloved hands trembling from cold and static, the coin warming in his palm, the silent counting of steps. His contradictory impulse—accepting the challenge not for money but to test a private theory—drives every move, and the final quiet humming and light footsteps show a micro-choice hierarchy that costs him the “long way” and Voss’s approval. The flaw: we never feel a genuine struggle with fear or doubt; competence dominates, so the endurance lacks visible cost beyond a grin. Still, his perceptual signature (ozone taste, container groans as positional cues) remains individual and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s “spiralingly calm” attribute is shown through steady micro-choices (tilting shutters, angling the mirror) that align with her goal; the mirror as maternal gift gives personal back-story cue without summary overload. Interiority stays concrete—“the silence was a wall, but also a bridge”—and her final pause SHOWS earned stasis rather than announcing change. Cost is subtle—she leaves the patterns to fade, accepting perpetual return—but visible enough for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clara’s grief-turned-rebellion is credibly embodied in tactile micro-choices (cradling board, setting pieces on moss). The “hears unspoken words” gift is shown rather than told when she answers Lila’s silent scream. Lila’s arc from *I’m alone* to *I’m learning* is legible and earned, though her father-feelings are relayed more via Clara than through her own risky micro-choices. Cost is present but pooled in shared mood rather than a sharp, personal stake-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—she scoffs at tales, clenches the scrimshaw, laughs through tears—yet the “true nature” she embraces is asserted more than dramatized. Contradictory impulses appear early (pride in dock work vs. pull to sea) but flatten once the whale appears; no micro-choice after the swim back tests her new self. Still, the embodied arc from clutching to releasing the talisman carries visible cost and forecloses return, satisfying the 9− threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lirael’s flat-affect puppeteer past and family loss are cleanly anchored; the spoon-carving ritual embodies her refusal to forget without overt grief-display. Interiority stays concrete (“smoothness is a lie”) and her final whisper earns its cost. The static mask never slips into contradiction, so endurance feels earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s aesthetic obsession is vivid—her fingers “reading frost,” her voice “paraphrasing the wind.” Yet the promised interior contradiction (craving dissolution yet clinging to beauty) is asserted, not dramatized; she never risks failure or moral cost. The final step onto liquid glass should crystallize a value hierarchy, but reads as triumphant fait accompli rather than earned renunciation. No micro-choice visibly forecloses an alternative path, so the “tremor of certainty” feels given, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative—his synesthetic ambition, his sideways seeing—but the pivot to “I’ve just started to see” feels sudden; the moth’s whisper and mural-vision are imposed more than earned by prior micro-choices. Marla’s motives (phoenix fire as deliberate gift) are asserted in expositional flash rather than dramatized contradiction, so the relationship crucible never truly heats. The colorblindness is shown pressing one choice—accepting cobalt dust—but the final stance leap overshoots the visible stair-steps of causality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s curiosity and “powerfully gentle” stance are consistent, but interiority stays safe; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final “keep questioning” is credible yet costs nothing on the page—no risk, forfeiture, or visible flaw confronted—so the arc feels complete but not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s grief is vivid, but interiority slips into label-speak (“subdued thrill,” “quiet, burning certainty”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the first lantern is tested; folding cranes is repetitive, not escalating. Atonement motive stays static—no moment where he risks or forfeits anything tangible—so the final pendant feels commemorative, not costly. Missing a beat where the stencil’s living shadows could force a decision that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s onyx-card cartomancer identity and “reverse-engineer” drive are vivid, but her interiority drifts into explanatory shorthand (“reverse engineer chaos by measuring its echoes”) that tells us the motive rather than staging a contradictory impulse. The moment she rewinds the tape and says “This is how we rebuild” is the first time her choice carries visible cost; earlier beats show pattern more than pressure. Mara functions mostly as witness, so status dynamics and crucible pressure are thin; the story meets single-POV defaults but keeps secondary character too peripheral to deepen Elara’s stakes. The curiosity trait is asserted, not tested—no beat where it collides with risk—so the arc is more portrait than compelled transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her contradiction between hunger for truth and fear of corruption is embodied in trembling hands and the veil she uses as armor. The micro-choice to press her palm to the pagoda crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet Kael functions mostly as a fear-fog mouthpiece; his absence after the hummed pagoda feels like a missed status/relationship crucible rather than earned escape. Cost is present—she accepts the “warm, alive” light that clings to her skin—but the final beat remains more image than irreversible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s “softly deliberate” trait is shown through her decision to study footage instead of alerting the council, but interiority stays general (“her mind raced”) and the final word-choice beat feels lightly motivated rather than driven by a visible contradiction or cost. The twin-stone gesture is elegant yet the emotional price is implied, not embodied. Enough micro-choice links action to motive to clear the 7-band, but the peak beat lacks a charged internal split that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hands, the weight of betrayal, the way sunlight once coaxed plants back—yet the “shedding” epiphany is articulated more than dramatized, nudging into diagnostic label-speak at the hinge moment. The ethical calculus is present and personal, but the micro-choice that commits her to the new stance (the exact second she decides to keep softness) is elided; we see the adhesive dry, not the irrevocable yes. Emotional layering is credible; still, the beat where fear of naïveté is actually jettisoned happens offstage, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s scar-as-map desire is vivid, but the leap from “closure seeker” to “coffee-ring tunnel diver” feels externally scripted; no interior contradiction surfaces before she kneels. The mother’s voiceovers supply thematic labels instead of pressure-tested memories. Micro-choices (touch frost, descend) are obedient, never surprising. Earned renunciation lands, but the emotional cost is declared—“heart light”—rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to resurrect “unused love” while fearing its cost—peaks when she cups the lilac-scented air, a tactile micro-choice that forecloses leaving the Alhambra. Emotional embodiment is strong (‘the ache in her chest’), but the film-vision epiphany is slightly performative (“Her throat tightened”) rather than physically disruptive under pressure. Grandmother’s letters act as an off-stage motivator; on-page causality is filtered through smoky-quartz sensation, so the drive feels inherited more than personally forged. Still, the renunciation—accepting custodianship of strangers’ grief—carries visible cost and is earned within the single-scene arc.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s longing for lost stardust and “trapped creativity” is vivid, but the interiority drifts into poetic label-speak (“mind hummed with half-formed symphonies”). The moment he tips the jar and the dust melts into his skin is a visceral micro-choice that alters him; the cost is felt. Yet the prior causality is dream-logic, not character-logic: the archway, voice, and jars appear because the sextant “captures memory,” not because Kael actively risks anything. The arc lands in credible elation, but the stakes feel pre-ordained by wonder rather than by his flawed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s dreamlessness is stated, not dramatized; the coat-of-light gift externalizes change instead of forcing him to pay an internal cost. The final beat—“for the first time, Kael dreamed”—is declarative summary; we feel no bodily shock or contradiction. Interiority stays generic (“chest ached”) and never shows conflicting impulses under pressure. The woman’s flickering presence is vivid but functions as oracle, not crucible; thus Kael’s turn feels assisted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s longing to recover her lost “wild frontier” is stated early and re-stated rather than dramatized; the only embodied choice—inserting the gear—happens once and costs nothing we feel. Interiority drifts toward abstract self-labeling (“sixth sense,” “wild frontier”) instead of contradictory impulse. The father-hologram delivers thematic summary in place of a final micro-choice that would lock in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s calm authority and Jorin’s tentative curiosity are cleanly drawn through gesture and dialogue, but both remain archetypal “guides” without contradictory interior texture. The punch-passing ritual hints at history yet never complicates either guide’s motives under pressure. Jorin’s final brightness feels more conferred than earned; we witness no micro-choice that visibly costs him. Relationship stays mentor/acolyte throughout, so the crucible never tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elric’s shift from muteness to speech is legible and tied to a tangible cost (the bench bolt, the child’s first clumsy chord), but his interiority is couched in abstract sermonizing (“safety is not a cage but a garden”) rather than body-level contradiction. The moment of decision is externally prompted by Lady Veyra’s scream rather than a prior interior fracture we witness in scene, so the change feels managed rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s drive is crystalline, her interiority tactile (“weight in her palm felt like destiny”), yet the “regally unpretentious” trait is asserted twice without a visible trade-off or cost; the moment she claims the throne is decisive but her internal contradiction is told, not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s inner contradiction—grief for the reef versus the need to decode the atlas—is vivid in her tapping and sleepless cross-referencing. Kael exists mainly as a foil; his single on-page challenge (“You’re obsessed”) still forces Lira to double-down, so the relationship functions as a crucible. The final choice to sail into the storm is foreshadowed by her dream and the plankton coordinates, but the cost (abandoning the station, physical risk) is more asserted than felt—no bodily friction, no tool loss, no moment of “we may drown.” Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak, but the endurance lacks a visible price on the page, capping the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity is vivid—calloused feet, opera glasses, outsider stance—but “awkwardly confident” is asserted, not embodied in micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes (“the mess had meaning”) yet the cost is communal, not personally etched into her body or future. Interiority is specific until the peak beat, where diagnostic shorthand (“madness is just clarity”) flattens contradiction. Still, her pattern-recognition drive fuels every beat and the closure choice is hers.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Nana Marisol’s insurgent past and plant telepathy are shown through memory and momentary sensation, not label-speak, and her final choice to plant the embryo is rooted in her lifetime of balancing tradition and change. The interiority stays concrete—hands trembling, sulfur mist, blistering palms—so the emotional stakes feel earned. The only slack is the instant leap from “legend” to decisive action; a micro-beat of her recalling a specific wartime loss tied to the embryo myth would have locked causality. Still, her refusal to control the future crystallizes a credible endurance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lila’s grief is credibly embodied—trembling hands, the photograph ritual—but her interiority occasionally slides into therapy-speak (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”) that flattens contradiction. The freeze action is dramatized twice, each time with visible cost, earning the final unfurling of the photo. Mrs. Voss functions more as thematic mouthpiece than independent pressure source, softening relationship-as-crucible. Still, the contradiction between clinging to and releasing Elias is held in scene, not summary, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—painting ghosts while despising tarot’s “pretense of fate”—is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every micro-choice (tearing the Hanged Man, weaving threads). Embodied stress shows in smudged glasses, rib-ache, candle flame reflected in the portrait’s eyes. The shift from passive cataloguer to active re-weaver is earned: grandmother’s loom memory plus present claustrophobia force the redesign, paying the price of abandoning paint for thread. Crestfallenness is shown through client abandonment and city indifference, not label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s grief-propelled quest is vivid, but her only on-page choice—spilling ink and walking off—feels lightweight; the brother-stake stays abstract, so the final step carries limited cost. Interiority is atmospheric yet drifts toward poetic summary (“serene anger burned through restraint”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The child momentarily sharpens her resolve, but no relationship shifts state, keeping the crucible narrow. Still, traits (albino tracker, wild intuition) color perception and action consistently, satisfying baseline credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—archive loyalty vs. truth—surfaces early and drives the chamber release, but the moment of risking everything is narrated rather than embodied; Kael remains a thawed symbol whose only micro-choice is to stand up, so the dyad’s status shift is declared, not dramatized. “Bravely conflicted heart” is label-speak repeated without new bodily cost after the first mention, flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s pacifist stance and inherited mission are stated rather than embodied; no moment forces her to test or betray that creed, so the arc is static. The final “revolution” is asserted, not dramatized—no visible cost or contradiction proves she has staked anything. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“the farm was a manifesto”) that tells us weight instead of letting us feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s cool-headed stoicism stays consistent, but interior contradiction is only hinted—no clashing impulse is dramatized in-scene. His single visible cost is the goddess’s dissolution, yet the emotional price is felt more through atmosphere than through Kael’s body or choice. The rail-spike micro-choices are present, but they read as competent technique rather than wrenching gamble; still, the calm-grief fusion is memorable and specific to him.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s contradictory motives—idealism vs. dynastic loyalty—are dramatized in the moment she palms the sharp nib and decides to research. The embodied tremor of her hand and the memo’s paternal betrayal ground her pivot; cost is the cut skin and severed filial myth. Endurance (continued testimony, op-eds) shows earned stasis, though late-line “truth is a compass” drifts toward epigram. Interiority mostly stays concrete; a hairline slip is the compressed jump from discovery to congressional testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—“guilt etched into her bones” lands—but her final surrender to the firmware rewrite feels abrupt; the mother-letter beat supplies motive yet no visible micro-choice on the page. The contradiction between star-map escapism and maternal duty is asserted, not dramatized in a single observable action with cost. Voice remains coherent, but the climactic renunciation lacks an embodied beat that forecloses her prior identity as tattooist.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her chalk pouch, the way she “traces” the tile, the micro-choice to press it into the wall. The “lilac unease” is a label, but it is quickly grounded in bodily tension and later traded for “quiet determination,” so the epiphany feels earned. Flaws are hinted (whimsy vs. obsession) but stay mild; the cost is conceptual (she forfeits observer safety) rather than relational or material, acceptable at this length. Voice stays coherent and specific; no head-count or status issues.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s “aberrant mercy” creed is dramatized in the single physical act of re-setting the tessera, but the interiority drifts into circulated phrasing (“cradle empathy in arms of steel” appears three times) rather than fresh contradiction under pressure; the retrocognitive flashes show memory but never force a micro-choice that risks failure, so the final stance feels pre-decided rather than earned at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s hunger for one more curtain-call is vivid, but his interior contradiction—why an immortal echo still craves mortal applause—stays abstract. The synesthetic gift is shown (“apples tasted of autumn twilight”) yet never complicates or costs him on the page; it decorates rather than drives choice. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under threat; he simply keeps humming until the world heals. Because the final fade is graceful but not renunciatory, the cost feels aesthetic, not existential.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for clarity yet distrusting engineered shortcuts—remains vivid in embodied tics (tingling wrist, geode palm-press). The micro-choice to keep mapping instead of swallowing a refund pill crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Mara’s pressure as witness sharpens his stance; her willowglass hope mirrors without merging voices. Cost is felt: the shock’s persistent burn and the grandmother-gift he might fracture if wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her gloved fingers, the pulse under her skin—but the epiphany “I was no longer just…” is a touch diagnostic. The fossil’s crumbling to dust supplies visible cost, yet the renunciation of her old mapper identity is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure. Still, embodied emotions and a coherent arc lift her into strong territory.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tracing glass, breath catching—but the “quietly inspired” trait is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she glides from discovery to mastery without visible flaw or hesitation. The final stance is credible, yet the cost is only atmospheric, not personal or tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured—“the hollow where her courage used to live”—and her decision to vouchsafe the codes is embodied in kneeling, quill-in-dirt action. Yet contradictory impulses stay mostly sequential (dream memory → present resolve) rather than simultaneous; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is more asserted (“the real journey…had only just begun”) than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Thaddeus’s “closely attentive” trait and distiller motive stay consistent, but every beat is interior observation; no micro-choice tightens or forecloses a path. The yarn needle warms yet never pricks a decision; the ferry ride ends where it began. Interiority is atmospheric, not conflicted; contradictions and cost are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—zen detachment vs. the need to anchor memory—remains abstract; her single on-page decision (leaving the oasis) is causally clean but cost is stated, not embodied. The younger-self vision supplies back-story motive yet no present-tactic pressure; embodiment stays in “hands steady, heart quiet” shorthand rather than sensory tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “calloused hands,” the jasmine he “coaxed into bloom,” the dock water “chill” on his feet. The contradiction between light-seeking and pragmatic endurance is present but stated more than acted; only the final gift of the gauge to Mara forces a visible micro-choice. His motivation is consistent, but the moment of personal cost (handing over the talisman) is slightly under-dramatized, muting the felt price. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—clinging to species-memory while forging a self—are dramatized in the sundial scene where she whispers separation (“I see you, but I am not you”). The micro-choice of laying her palm on the dial crystallizes renunciation with visible cost: the ancestral images vanish, leaving her alone with the spiral. Interiority stays concrete and embodied (“her breath fogging the brass”), avoiding label-speak. The earned endurance of solitary writing forecloses return to collective soul, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers brushing the cool stone,” the chest-tighten of hollowness—but her moment of change is narrated rather than dramatized: “now, she understood.” The spiral memory is embodied, yet the final resolve (“she’d encourage them… write a letter of her own”) is asserted without a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s cautious hope is shown through tactile micro-choices—trembling hands, the coffee sip—but her interior contradiction (scientist’s doubt vs. believer’s resolve) stays stated more than dramatized. The final refusal to flinch under the voice-in-her-skull crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral because prior beats summarize stakes instead of embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s claustrophobia is shown through embodied beats (shallow breath, back against stone) and alters his tactics; the compass jab to still the corridor is a crisp micro-choice. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but “prudently adventurous” is label-only until the final lunge, so motivation feels slightly front-loaded rather than discovered. The earned moment—key drops into palm, cathedral shudders—carries visible cost and crystallizes his stance. Flaw complicates action; endurance is credibly costly, but the shift from dread to chase is abrupt, thinning the arc’s middle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s synesthetic, texture-driven perception is vividly particularized (“charcoal-stained glasses,” “light pooled in hollows”) and consistently steers her micro-choices—every tactile sketching stroke doubles as investigative action. Interior contradiction surfaces when her proclaimed empiricism collides with intuition about the ribbon’s “plea,” but the beat is compressed into one declarative line rather than dramatized tension. The final renunciation—setting the ribbon beside the portrait—carries visible cost (she forfeits private obsession to communal memory), yet the emotional price feels lightly registered because the prior “numbness” was told, not shown. Still, her perceptual signature is unforgettable and motives track cleanly under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her “fingers tracing faded ink” and the micro-choice to pocket the nail show embodied motive. The internal contradiction between duty to archive and hunger for ancestral justice is active in-scene, not summarized. The final rooftop beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values: ancestral truth > institutional safety, with the warming nail as tactile cost. Only minor slip: “nervously confident” is named twice rather than shown through idiosyncratic bodily tell.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s sharply observant nature is felt through percussion of sensory cues, but the interior tension between his skepticism and emergent credulity is reported rather than dramatized; the flake ignition scene is mostly declarative. Marisol exists only as projected cipher, so status crucible is not on page. The final “chance to sculpt” is telegraphed, not visibly costly yet, leaving ambiguity over what path he forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s desire to break patrimonial greed is concrete; the foreign bills as talismanic reminders work. Interiority stays vivid (“polished calm” refracts through micro-choices). Yet the pivotal turn—his decision to use territorial markers—arrives via summary, not a pressured scene, so the renunciation feels slightly intellectual rather than embodied. Father’s “snake” aphorism haunts effectively, but Elias’s final emotional cost is more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s grief for her brother and chronicler’s detachment are cleanly dramatized; the moment she lets the prism’s light “warm her” embodies the decisive surrender of detachment. Interiority stays concrete, though the brother’s voice remains off-stage; a single hairline slip keeps this from 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s guardedness is shown through tactile detail (bark-rough hands, thorn-walled heart) and a single micro-choice—releasing the seed—that externalizes her need to confront the buried memory. The interior contradiction is present but compressed; the blood-stained past is revealed more by vision than by pressured in-scene decision, so the final acceptance feels lightly earned rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lirael’s scars ache and guide her, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“constellation of white lines”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The golden-eyed double voices the thematic payoff aloud, stealing the moment of earned realization from Lirael’s own choice. No visible micro-choice in the final beat—she simply “walked out”—so the renunciation feels declared, not dramatized. Diagnostic label-speak in peak beat triggers −0.5; cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—reckless forward motion versus the need for gentleness—are dramatized in the stitching scene where she literally sews her own regret into bone; the moment is embodied, costly, and particular. The skeleton’s prior bargain and the keeper’s teasing of “doubt” create credible pressure that forces her to renounce certainty, earning the change. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, knowledge states shift through tactile contact with bone and fruit. The only limit to 9-band is that the keeper’s motivation remains functional rather than fully dimensional, but within 750 words this is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is vivid (“hollow space where purpose used to live”) and embodied emotion surfaces in trembling fingers, yet the decisive shift to “resurrecting forgotten stories” is announced rather than dramatized in a micro-choice on the page; the phone call compresses the moment of agency. The flaw is softened because the cloth talisman is kept in pocket, a tangible cost, giving Earned Stasis lite.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s kindly-methodical nature is shown via tactile micro-choices—comparing spirals to magnetic fields, chanting softly, pressing palm to trunk—each anchoring her interior contradiction between scientific detachment and caretaker responsibility. The “haunted ambitions” echo is never wrestled with as a lived flaw; it hovers as theme-label, so the internal cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Final “earned stasis” lands because she foregoes definitive answers for ongoing stewardship, but the absence of a second character or status clash caps relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The librarian’s identity flux is stated, not dramatized; the woman’s fear→dive→feather arc is legible but compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels light. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; both characters speak in therapeutic slogans (“Fear is a tide”). The micro-choice that earns the change is off-stage—she simply “plunges” and re-emerges transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is sharply particularized through sensory-filtered perception and occupational habit; his micro-choice to place the pearl is embodied, irreversible, and charged with visible cost (the pearl dissolves, his life purpose pivots). The only slack is a trace of therapeutic self-label (“I was a conduit”) mid-rapture, but interior contradiction hums throughout and the final stance is causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied; the contradiction between her cartographic precision and emotional stagnation is visible in her “meticulous, daringly methodical sketches” versus the “stagnant pool” of guilt. The accordion-playing is a tactile micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values—art over pharmacological silence—and the final map-of-the-heart beat earns the renunciation of linear forgiveness. The only slip is the shorthand “quest to map the labyrinth of her regrets,” which momentarily abstracts what the scene otherwise dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s hunger for “unspoken words” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“she wondered if he had known”) rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. The stolen watch crackles with potential backstory yet never collides with a visible moral cost or relationship crucible; we are told obsession, not shown it compounding. Micro-choices (pulling the book) arrive late and feel predetermined by cipher logic rather than personal blind spot, blunting the final renunciation’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. insurgent ambition—peaks when she chooses renunciation, but the leap from coffee-stain prophecy to throne-usurpation is asserted more than dramatized; no single micro-choice shows the exact hinge where ambition flips to refusal, so the cost is felt only atmospherically, not through a visible, character-bound forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tremble, her breath syncs with aurora pulses—yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. risk collapse) stay mostly summarized, not enacted in a single, pressured beat. The beautician-mortician duality is shown through the moonlight-painting and lullaby choices, but the final renunciation (grotto intact, echo safe) costs her exhaustion rather than a visible path foreclosed. Micro-choices are present, yet the emotional hierarchy between “save Elion” and “save all echoes” is asserted, not dramatized with a moment of irreversible trade-off. Meets 9- gate: cost visible, lens held; falls short of 9+ because the decisive internal contradiction is not crystallized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is mostly concrete (fingernails in bark, shell weight), but the moment of forgiveness three years ago is delivered as retrospective label—“a quiet understanding”—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elara’s return of the hairpin is externally motivated by off-stage “guilt,” so Lirael’s choice to trust again feels eased rather than earned in-scene. Still, the climbing/tree-thinking habit tracks as a character-specific ritual that reveals hierarchy of values. Micro-choice at the end—pinning the shell and hairpin together—visibly forecloses vengeance and lands a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s “conscience for hire” premise is credibly lived-in: the hollow mirror shard appears twice with different clients, his shrug is both mask and habit, and the choice to let Mira remove the final chime is a micro-choice that costs him the cloak he might have kept. Interiority stays concrete (“the word tasting foreign on his tongue”) and avoids therapeutic gloss. The only drag is the faint safety-hedge in his rare smile—still, the flaw is sub-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. guardian of secrecy—are alive in every beat; her decision to let Lira struggle is dramatized, not declared. The spiraling ripple that triggers Lira’s “becoming” is the earned payoff of this withheld facilitation, with felt cost in Elara’s own unspoken loneliness. Interiority stays sensorial (“silver hair catching starlight”) rather than diagnostic. Minor slip: Lira’s interiority is reported rather than embodied, so the crucible is slightly lopsided.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the arrowhead warmth and “resolve hardened” are stock. The epiphany—alignment not stillness—lands, yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized; we are told decades of failure, not shown one beat of micro-choice under pressure. Cost is asserted (“numbers dwindling”) rather than felt. Earned Stasis is nominally reached, but the price is abstract; the character never risks or loses anything on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s “underachieving mage” label is shown rather than told through the failed-spell backstory and his trembling approach to the keystone; the garden memory and final sketch choice give a credibly embodied cost. Interiority slips into mild therapy-speak (“he realized then that…”) twice, blunting contradiction. The micro-choice to pour starlight is sharp, but the later “tears freezing” feels cosmetic rather than driven by a fresh contradiction. Still, the arc from insecure failure to earned quiet pride lands with visible forfeiture of grand magic for a humble garden, satisfying the 9− test.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s grief for Lila is embodied through the key-tag burn and the auditory “stain” her last words left; the interior contradiction between nightly “truth” and secret quest is visible. Yet the pivot choice—surrendering the key and admitting self-seeing—arrives with only a single whispered line; the causal cost feels light because no alternative path is foreclosed on-page. Micro-choices (wading, unlocking, book-opening) repeat but do not escalate stakes; the emotional crescendo is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, his perceptual signature (lamps, salt, color-of-sound synesthesia) remains particular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s quiet enthusiasm is shown through tactile coin-handling and sensor-tuning, but interiority drifts into abstract cosmology-speak (“wavelength align with purpose”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallizes when the coin-tower circuit becomes a bodily conduit, paying visible cost as the deck shudders and coins spark; still, the emotional before/after is more conceptual than embodied. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; micro-choices stay coherent but never truly risk failure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s grief over Lira is concrete—his trembling hands, the whispered answer to her final question—and his micro-choice to name the monsters anyway crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays specific to a reaper who no longer reaps: “the reaper’s heart, once broken, now beat with distant intimacy.” No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc is linear rather than torn, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s earnest naiveté is vivid—we feel the bell’s rim bite his flesh—but his interiority edges toward diagnosing his own brittleness (“clung to the idea…”). The moment he collapses and concedes imperfection crystallizes a credible, costly stance; still, the brief self-explanatory flicker keeps him just shy of the 8-band where full contradiction-in-scene would live.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s watchful vigilance is concrete—boots on gravel, flashlight beam slicing dark—but her interior contradiction (guard duty vs. memory-keeper) stays summary. The moment she lays her own photo beside the ghosts, a micro-choice finally embodies the “precisely humane” trade-off, paying the cost of shared stewardship. Prior beats lean on label-speak (“chest tightened”) rather than embodied emotion. Daughter’s entrance is too late to test status dynamics; still, the final stance crystallizes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich and sensorially anchored; the hand-in-flame beat embodies her hierarchy of values. The “secretly sentimental” trait is shown only in the final beat—till then it’s told—so the cost feels previewed rather than earned in scene. Still, the contradiction between logic-parent rigor and poet-parent wonder pulses throughout, and the final spiral-in-mud image crystallizes her earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s grief-linked vigilance and tactile “listening” give him a sharp, embodied signature; the buckle-as-key feels lived-in. Yet the interior contradiction—yearning for mother vs duty—is stated more than dramatized in-scene, and the final “smile” lands tidy, muting cost. Still, micro-choices (node presses, binary clicks) track motive cleanly and earn the spiral fix.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Intriguing premise, but Kael's psychology relies on diagnostic shorthand ("ego death," "emotional numbness") rather than on-page contradiction; the clone taunts but relationship/status pressure stays one-note; the pivotal renunciation ("you're a choice") feels asserted, not earned by displayed interior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity-driven autonomy powers every beat; the envelope/seed triggers a credible cascade of micro-choices (testing, planting, brook pursuit) that externalize his “notably receptive” trait. Interiority stays concrete—hands calloused, spectrometer borrowed, dream image—avoiding label-speak. The earned laugh-key moment crystallizes a value hierarchy: puzzle-solver yields to nature’s puzzle, foreclosing sterile control. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the plant’s agency mildly absconds with true flaw-compounded error, keeping him just shy of 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motive is legible—restore laughter—but interiority drifts into abstract “unspoken” therapy-speak; no visible flaw or contradiction drives final collapse. Embodied cost is present (blisters, hoarse voice) yet feels listed, not lived. Micro-choice hierarchy missing: he never considers quitting even when arms “like lead,” so endurance reads default, not earned. Leaf-blower-as-music idea stays external; tool never becomes extension of self, keeping conductor persona ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s feral patience, dimensional homesickness, and clawed stillness are vividly embodied; the tossed pendant crystallizes her refusal to surrender uncertainty. Interior contradiction is present—longing for home yet guarding this world—but the final beat could sharper show the cost of that renunciation. The mentor’s reappearance feels slightly gift-wrapped; a trace more earned doubt would push the arc to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “stoically sensitive” trait is dramatized through contact with the crozier: the ivory bites, he bleeds, he still presses on—embodied cost under pressure. Interiority stays particular (“the phrase tasting of rust,” “truthsayer of his own marrow”) and avoids label-speak. The final self-wounding choice is causally prepared by earlier failures and the mentor’s voiced paradox, yielding Earned Stasis with visible scars. Cap at 8.7 because the single-POV isolation means no status crucible or relationship shift to deepen the beat further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his mantra “Discard assumptions” is concrete and reiterated through tactile dismantling. The emotional arc moves from cerebral curiosity to awestruck comprehension, embodied in the searing palm that lifts the fragment. Yet the transformation feels slightly unconflicted; no real flaw or doubt complicates his ascent to insight, so the change, while legible, lacks the cost that would push it to the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s trait—resilient optimism—shows early, collapses under the grotto’s pressure, then rekindles after the merge, giving a visible arc. Interiority stays concrete (“tears streaming down his face” vs. earlier grin). The moment he whispers “Okay” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values: ferry-keeper duty > personal safety. Cost is felt—ferry, passengers, hourglass all gone—but the beat is summarized, not dramatized live, so the endurance lacks full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clara’s interiority is sensuous—“fever dream architect” hints at a mind that sculpts delirium—but the text leans on label-speak (“rational enchantment,” “texture of connection”) instead of contradictory impulse in scene. Micro-choices are present (thread-handling, step through door) yet remain symbolic gestures; we feel no genuine flaw or cost that would foreclose a path. The curator is a cipher-prism, supplying thematic commentary more than secondary pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is muted. Emotional progression is steady but tidy; the calm feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is serviceable—her quiet need for grounding is anchored to the chain-link relic and the dome vista—but contradiction, micro-choice, and embodied cost arrive late and mildly. The “anchor” object does re-weight her final pedagogical moment, yet no prior beat shows her tempted to abandon teaching or to hoard the relic; the emotional turn is asserted rather than dramatized. Students remain a polite chorus; Tarel’s question is the single pressure spike, too brief to act as crucible. Result: character resonates but does not compel under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lila’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—“her persistently curious mind” is label-speak rather than embodied thought. The only embodied emotion is the throat-tightening beat, too brief to show contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (placing hearing aids, jotting words) align with motive yet carry no visible cost; the closure gift feels gifted, not earned. Because the man’s apparition does the emotional labor, her arc is observational, not crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s claustrophobia and gold-obsession are viscerally anchored, but the brother motive is told in one flash; her decisive act (slapping the fleck) is abrupt, so the cost feels neat rather than earned. Interiority is concrete, yet the emotional turn is compressed into a single exhale before escape.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s compulsive heartbeat-count and porcelain-pressing embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the final “defragment” is a credible micro-choice that accepts the ghost as compass. Interiority stays concrete—“ink climbed its ridges”—never drifting into label-speak. The only flaw is that OBS-7’s status and power remain vague, blurring the cost of overriding it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Her obsession with translating texture into sound is viscerally embodied (copper shimmer, stylus on vein). The diamond throw is a credible renunciation, but the interior turn “I am the extinction” arrives as a declarative epiphany rather than a dramatized contradiction; still, the embodied cost (burnt palm, echo-roar) keeps the score in high-low 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s undercover motive is clear, but her interiority oscillates between researcher detachment and mystic surrender without a visible micro-choice that tips the scale; the metamorphosis is imposed by the arrowhead rather than catalyzed by a conscious, costly decision. The “bitterness → cosmic joke” stance is asserted, not dramatized in a beat where she risks anything. Result: credible arc, but the final stance feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s longing is vivid—her bleeding fingers, moth-wing hands—but the interior contradiction between “reawaken beauty” and “let chaos hold order” is asserted, not dramatized. The locust-shell heartbeat is original embodiment, yet the final leap to “trust chaos” feels lightly earned because no prior choice shows her risking failure on that belief. Still, her micro-choices (pressing shell to crack, playing past snapped string) visibly cost her body, satisfying the 9+ quick test for endured price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s motivation stays abstract—‘to find where broken promises heal’ remains label-level; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice shows why this particular bottle-storm matters to him. Interiority is rich in metaphor but thin in specific personal stakes; we never learn what loss or betrayal drives him. The only visible cost is shoulder-strap pain—too generic to foreclose a path. Endurance earns no new knowledge, so the arc plateaus rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elio’s “quietly persistent” trait is shown through tactile searching and wordless singing, but interior contradiction is only hinted at; the final choice to sing feels gentle rather than costly, so the arc stays light. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices are present (kneel, pocket shard, open ivy door) yet none force a visible trade-off; the halo fragment warms but never cuts or compels sacrifice. Earned stasis is implied—he leaves without reclaiming the train—but the cost is atmospheric, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on the scarf’s raised threads, the restlessness that “the silence had grown heavier”—and her micro-choice to light the candle at midnight drives the portal beat. Yet the sanely-eccentric label is announced, not dramatized; no visible cost attaches to her decision, so the arc feels more discovery than crucible. The young patron functions only as prompt, not pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the embodied attention to analog texture keeps her idiosyncratic and believable.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Contradictory impulses (chase vs. fear of loss) are dramatized in the feverish brush-strokes; renunciation of further painting is earned by the prior epiphany and carries visible cost in the emptied palette. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Emotional progression layers credibly: obsession, panic, recognition, quiet release.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative—‘his eyes burned with a quiet intensity’—and his trembling pick embodies the cost. The contradictory impulse to honour yet betray the woman’s secrecy is dramatised in the beat when the ribbon unravels. Still, the moment of conceptual release is slightly abstract; we feel the whispers but not a concrete, character-specific memory that would fully nail the renunciation. Closure is earned, but the emotional specificity could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s curiosity is credibly lifelong and obsessive; the dream prompt and locket discovery give concrete micro-moments that externalize his interior. Yet the interiority stays safely “professor-ish,” never letting contradictions or fatigue fracture his diction under pressure. The final seated vigil is a convincing renunciation, but because the decision is narrated as serene rather than charged with cost, it lands as stasis, not earned. Still, within 800 words the motive arc is coherent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s habit of walking backwards and reading tea-leaf geometries are vivid, embodied quirks that align with her mirrored, fate-divining role; her interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak. The contradictory impulse—to guide others while fearing her own reflection—remains latent but implied rather than dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict never spikes under visible pressure. Her choice to mentor the girl is soft; the cost is atmospheric rather than a palpable path foreclosed. Still, voice-specific gestures (back-steps, shard pocketing) individualize her above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief for vanishing color is vivid, but her interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“tapestry of whispers”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The climactic choice—hurl the seed—feels inevitable yet the cost is borne by the orchard, not by her body or value system, so the personal price stays ornamental. Still, her pruning gestures and dream obedience give a concrete occupational spine that lifts her above symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her needle-work embodies fear, duty, and awakening—and her micro-choices (kneel, push faster, pocket the key) track a believable shift from avoidance to listening. The “broken mask restorer” identity, however, is asserted rather than dramatized; no cracked mask appears, so the promised vocational lens never shapes action. Elias remains functional cipher, emitting lore but no status pressure; his smoke-like movement is cliché, not earned. Dialogue is terse and goal-driven, yet the climactic line “Now you listen” lands as directive, not crucible—Mara’s assent feels lightly motivated rather than wrung through contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through tactile beats (aligning sextant, frame-by-frame comparison) that drive every major turn; the final descent is credibly motored by his grandfather’s journal cue and his own perceptual habits. Interiority stays concrete—breath fogging the lens, chest tightening—avoiding label-speak. The only slack: we never feel a genuine flaw that could betray him; competence is too smooth, so the cost feels intellectual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s obsession with “quantum decay” as grief-metaphor is vivid, but her interior contradictions stay verbal (“physics of letting go” repeated) rather than acted upon under pressure; no micro-choice shows her risking failure or forfeiture. The mother-globe memory motivates the search, yet the climactic realization feels transferred from tape analysis rather than earned by her own tested gamble. Competent, but the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivations—grief, guilt, the need to speak the unspeakable—are vivid in the graffiti beats and in the tremble of the bolt-plate; interior contradiction is shown, not told. The final “Speak” mirror-stroke crystallizes a credible micro-choice that costs him the safety of silence. Missing is one beat where the ghost resists or complicates his act; the stakes stay internal, so the external world feels slightly frictionless. Still, the arc of pressing flowers and pressing secrets into stone gives a felt, character-specific cost that lands as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s warmly inquisitive nature is stated early and drives her to open the diary, but the trait never complicates her path or costs her anything; it remains a label rather than a crucible. Her decision to hand the goggles and diary to the widow is the only visible act that alters the relational state, yet the interior motive is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The moment of pressing her hand to the widow’s chest gestures toward embodied emotion, but the beat is too compressed to register cost or irreversible change. Interiority stays coherent, but the absence of a stakes-bearing mistake or loss keeps the characterization short of high-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid—her mother’s laughter in the farmhouse silence, the brass telescope against her palm—but the “spooled wholeness” belief is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory choice. Voss functions as skeptic foil only; no status shift or mutual pressure alters Lila’s stance. The final “it’ll change me” lands as self-summary, not earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s face-blindness is never permitted to complicate a single on-page choice; it stays a label. The one moment she could be forced to trust texture over sight—finding the panel by feel—is handed to her via coincidence of the coin fit. Interiority is vivid (“fractally precise patterns in the grain”) and her final artistic act credibly renounces facile commemoration for codified sky, but the missing causal friction between her supposed perceptual limit and the discovery keeps the arc short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, muttering constellations under breath—but the final leap reads slightly unearned: no prior beat shows her risking physical danger, so the jump feels more author-willed than character-compelled. Interior contradiction is strong early (desire vs. captain’s scorn), yet the climax lacks a visible internal cost or irreversible stance shift. Still, micro-choices (kneeling on cold metal, tracing squares) keep her alive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s want to “learn the rhythm of repair” is stated early and re-anchored to filial memory, but interiority stays general (“weight of that legacy”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the moment of triumph carries warmth yet no micro-choice reveals a cost or risk that would sharpen contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s altruism is constant but never complicated by contradictory impulse; the absence of interior contradiction keeps her just shy of full individuation. The settlers’ shift from fear to solidarity is sketched in collective strokes rather than through single named exemplars under pressure, so micro-choices that would make the group feel like discrete people are missing. Still, her transparency and the visible cost of her fading at the end give the arc a credible, gentle sting.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—calloused hands, trembling breath, the memory of solder-smell—and her flaw (doubt in her own calculation) is embodied, not labeled. The moment she presses her cracked palm to the pane, contradictory impulses (fear of error vs. duty to gentle the end) collide on-page, driving the climactic song. Cost is visible: the puppet head shatters, the pane fractures, her voice is permanently roughened; the path foreclosed is any future recalibration. Missing 9+ only because the micro-choice that tips her into singing is slightly under-dramatized—readers see the decision, feel the stakes, but not the visceral instant of yes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied through his jerky, ungraceful movements and the way he “tolerates” the birds; the nut-in-pocket micro-choice anchors his knowledge state and motivates every marker he leaves. Interior contradiction is present—he curses yet obeys the curse—but the traveler beat is too thin to test his hierarchy of values under real pressure, so the final shove reads as dutiful rather than costly. Still, the earned endurance of locking the door with the cracked nut gives a palpable cost that forecloses retreat, satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is alive—her polymer-eye reading foam as "temporary unity" is idiosyncratic and stakes her guilt. The sisters’ reunion beat, however, flattens into mutual label-speak ("we’ve been like this") that spells out the arc instead of embodying it, trimming the top band. Still, the chrysalis-handling micro-choices trace a credible hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s want—"to find the place where stories begin"—is declared early and recurs, but her interiority stays abstract ("her mind racing") and no micro-choice under pressure shows a value hierarchy; the renunciation at the end is gentle rather than costly. The milk-eyed stranger remains a cipher; no status shift or relationship crucible tests her. Still, the clean-slate premise is particular and her stall actions track with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nessar’s memory-tasting need and his “sand-papering” desire are dramatized in the coral-pool scene: he palms the door, kneels, fingers go numb, takes the founder’s guilt into his own tongue and body. The contradictory impulse—absorb to dilute—peaks when the pool blanks and the fortress air feels lighter; remorse is not removed but redistributed through him. Micro-choice hierarchy (taste vs. bear vs. cook) threads every beat, giving visible cost: the tingling tongue, unsteady legs, salt-stiff apron. Only gap: we never see how this gift first manifested or what limits it, so the interior rules feel porous.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown only in gentle humming and multilingual murmurs; no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized. Interiority drifts into therapeutic labels (“felt the harmony”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final address to villagers is summarized, not staged, so her micro-choice hierarchy is asserted, not tested. Still, her voice is specific, her obsession with bridge-building is continuous, and the occupation detail (mending hymnals) seeds the mechanical empathy that carries the story.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s helix-minded engineer trait is shown through tactile tool use and chaotic precision, but interiority drifts into diagnostic self-talk (“chaos in his own thoughts”) that flattens embodied emotion. The memory-bleed risk momentarily threatens passivity, yet his micro-choice to dial the headband while tasting ash embodies cost. The archeologist motive converts into an earned, visible act—rewiring the mirror—so renunciation lands with credible sting. Voice remains coherent; only the therapy-curl in peak beat keeps this shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lira’s prism-minded trait is shown only by label; no interior contradiction or kaleidoscopic perception appears under pressure. The key choice—taking one key—aligns with her goal but costs nothing on the page and is not complicated by flaw or fear. The ending stance shift (“keeper of thresholds”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the arc feels tidy rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s refusal-to-let-silence-win motive is declared early and restated rather than tested; the single decisive choice (shatter the insulator) is vivid but arrives without interior contradiction or visible trade-off, so the arc feels inevitable, not earned. Still, her embodied listening-through-bones and bleeding fingernails give tactile cost, keeping her above abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Alaric’s exile, chess metaphor obsession, and “thoughtfully precise” trait are dramatized through the tactile handling of the basalt stone and the micro-choice to plant the star-seed; the memory of Lira crystallizes his pedagogical drive and anchors the final renunciation with visible cost. Interior contradiction is present—hope vs. exile—but the star-mage’s appearance ventriloquizes his epiphany, blunting the full weight of earned self-confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael’s pacifism is stated, never pressure-tested; no contradiction or cost attaches to it. Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction (“catalog the varieties of silence”). The final empathy insight is earned by resonance, not by a visible choice that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. the hush—drives every beat; her olfactory micro-choices visibly constrain tactics. The seed-scent shifts are embodied, not labelled. The final renunciation (patience over push) is earned by prior causal tests and carries felt cost in the village’s re-calibrated energy. Only the grandmother dream feels slightly convenient, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s curiosity and protectiveness surface early, but interiority drifts into explanatory paraphrase (“she theorized”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels tidy; we see no residual fear or cost after the planet-scale rewiring. Competent, yet the emotional ledger stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Anya’s mentor-loss motive and professional training ground her choices; the buzzing patch embodies her internal conflict between rational procedure and uncanny intuition. Her embodied reactions—steady sensor adjustments, fingertip tremor on rust—show tension without cliché. The climactic recognition that the port “is hungry” feels earned because her earlier micro-choices (climbing toward the hum, pocketing the patch) foreshadow surrender to instinct. Cost is present but muted: she decides to “document it all,” accepting complicity with a machine she cannot shutdown, yet this forfeiture is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s synesthetic gift and her need to “certify wonder” give her a clear, idiosyncratic drive; the embodied color-perception beats (“sound bloomed as color”) keep interiority concrete. Micro-choice under pressure is thin—only the final bell-ring carries visible cost; earlier beats are more ritual than risk. The sculptor’s switch from skeptic to co-creator is announced rather than dramatized through staged status shifts. Earned stasis is present—the cavern’s new song is irreversible—but the emotional tax is felt more by the setting than by Lira herself.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s grief-stricken need to “harvest insights from failure” is palpable in every beat; his trembling fingers, broken flute, and final surrender show embodied contradiction under pressure. The mentor’s spectral appearances function as a crucible that forces Kael to confront successive past selves, each mistake materialized. The micro-choice to snap the reeds and accept silence is earned by the prior cascade of failures; the cost—his treasured tool destroyed—scales to the story’s brevity. Interiority stays concrete (“quiet hum in his chest”) and avoids diagnostic cliché; the only minor slip is the slightly abstract “need to harvest insights” phrasing at the open.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “mind racing with equations” and the tear-fogged goggles embody the arc. Mirroring habit and borrowed personalities shape key beats (confusion tactic, empathy overload). The final renunciation—accepting felt chaos over solved variables—carries visible cost and is causally seeded. Minor slip: “diagnostic” flavor in “emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires” could be more embodied, but contradiction is dramatized within two lines, limiting damage.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kail’s “jittery” trait is shown early through bodily detail and micro-choices, but the interiority drifts into stock phrases (“nerves frayed,” “instincts screamed”) that tell rather than embody tension. His final moment of earned calm is credible and seeded, satisfying the arc. Yet the mentor and the lantern-woman are vessels for cryptic exposition rather than real relational pressure, so the crucible test is weak. Interior contradiction is present but not layered deeply enough to reach the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her storm-cloud eyes, the prism biting her palm—and her micro-choice to whisper “Show me what you’ve seen” crystallizes her need. The final renunciation (“the arbor didn’t need her emotions”) is earned, but the shift from absorption to mirroring is declared rather than dramatized with new bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s stoic solitude and tactile obsession with the beads are vivid, but her interior contradiction—hope vs. acceptance—stays summary; the “wistful” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final renunciation (letting the bead float away) is credible and costly, yet the pivot from self-saving to messenger-saving is asserted more than earned in micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Jorin’s “quiet fire” is declared, not dramatized; the only embodied cost is the brief shard-cutting, which reads as ritual rather than earned wound. Interiority stays generic (“his throat tightened”) and never contradicts itself; we get no micro-choice that shows meekness colliding with resolve. The orb acceptance is smooth but foregone, so the arc is flat. Meets baseline credibility, misses contradiction-in-scene required for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s compulsion toward the shard is visceral and embodied; the “second heartbeat” line makes the urge legible. The final renunciation lands because the shard has hurt him all along—its absence now registers as cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the mother-parallel-world double is sketched too thinly to exert crucible pressure, so the relational stake feels assumed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s reticence is shown through gruff silence and pocketed hands, but the interiority never cracks under pressure; the “warmly observant” shift is told, not embodied. The final smile arrives without a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him—his arc is emotional but not crucible-tested. Interior contradiction is absent; the sea glass hum is sensed but doesn’t force a conflicting response. Still, the lone POV is consistent, and the endurance stance is credibly tied to his occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Herald’s interiority is vividly embodied—her laughter is a tactile force, her grip on the lantern a live wire of want. Contradictory impulses (yearn for prophecy vs. fear of what it costs) are present but compressed; the moment she decides “Let’s do this” feels more declared than earned, so the final cost is inferred rather than suffered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lin’s interiority is evocative—dye-master perception, post-transplant estrangement—but her contradictory impulses stay summary-level (“felt as though she were now two people”) and never collide in a single pressured beat. The final resolve to “illuminate stories” is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page pays the cost of that vow. Without an embodied fork-in-the-road moment, the arc reads as gentle uplift rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s curiosity about the trees is stated repeatedly but never dramatized; he never makes a micro-choice that risks anything or changes tactics because of that desire. His interiority is atmospheric (“he wondered… he believed…”) rather than conflicted under pressure. The healing cut is the only embodied cost, but it is passive—moonlight acts on him, not vice-versa—so the renunciation/stance feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s loneliness and bodily fatigue are lightly embodied, but her interiority leans on poetic abstractions—“fragments of a thousand lifetimes,” “scattered memory keeper”—rather than concrete, idiosyncratic thought. The remembered lullaby is a vivid micro-choice, yet the story never admits a contradictory impulse that might complicate her saintly resolve. The ending’s cost is atmospheric rather than personal; we feel the realm breathe, but Lira’s own future path remains unthreatened, so renunciation reads as gentle victory, not charged endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is specific—her thumb on frayed gold, the hush of empathy in a hooded room—and her contradictory desire to hide inside revelation drives every beat; the final cradle of letters earns her renunciation with visible cost. Flaw: “compassionate recluse” is named once rather than shown through micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s quiet, watching nature is credibly particular, but interiority stays on the abstract side (“he understood,” “he smiled, understanding”) rather than embodied contradiction. The single micro-choice—planting the seed—earns mild cost yet feels more emblematic than urgent. No genuine flaw complicates the act; the arc is gentle acceptance rather than pressured change. The absence of an on-page second character keeps status/relationship bullets inactive.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s trait of “gently meticulous” is repeatedly embodied in tactile beats—aligning quills, tuning the beam, scribbling ledger columns—so the label becomes behavior. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “quartz hush settling over the room,” not abstract labels. The final exhausted smile is earned by a causal chain of micro-successes and visible stamina cost. No secondary character on page, so no status crucible; headcount is appropriate for length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s stubborn persistence is embodied in every beat—crouching in brine, smashing the recorder with the fob she once clung to—so her final smile arrives as earned renunciation. The watch fob’s shift from talisman to weapon crystallizes her contradictory allegiance to both father and self-silencing code. Micro-choices (handing over the fob, smashing the reels) visibly price her loyalty. Only slight reserve: her interiority leans on inherited maxims (“Trust’s a currency”) rather than fresh self-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s skeptical-scientist streak and hunger to decode “weather-carriers” are concrete from the first sensory beat; the metallic-ozone taste test shows interior contradiction in-scene. His micro-choices (kneeling, palm-to-soil, spitting copper) externalize value-hierarchy under escalating threat. The closing refusal to keep the compass is dramatized, not declared, giving Earned Stasis with visible cost—he swallows “lavender and regret,” foreclosing disbelief. Only the blacksmith/Marlow axis stays off-page, so status crucible and secondary-pressure bullets are NA; no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—charcoal-black fingers versus starved soul—but the contradiction never sharpens into an immediate micro-choice that costs him something we can feel. The “quiet, persistent melody” and “cave listening” are evocative, yet the emotional risk stays generalized until the final beat; we sense relief but not the specific, embodied price of opening the shadow-door. Motivation is consistent, but the link between grandmother’s mnemonic gift and his own block remains thematic rather than a tool that pressures him here-now. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, so the arc is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than corporal.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s grief-driven quest is vivid, her quill-curse gives instant interior contradiction, and the final “seed” choice costs her the fantasy of intact last words. Yet the mother’s absence is only asserted, not dramatized, so the emotional peak leans on prior exposition rather than fresh pressure. Still, micro-choices (bribing plants, confronting the keeper) track motive cleanly and the renunciation lands.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The vow of silence and “preserve the color of wonder” give Elara a clean, if abstract, motive; she acts—tuning, descending, building—but her interior contradiction never sharpens into a moment where speech would have saved or cost her something. Seasonal muteness stays a label; no beat forces her to choose between voice and bell, so the muteness never complicates tactics. The iceberg fragment triggers the arc yet the stakes feel external to her body; the cost is borne by the ice, not her psyche. Closure is elegant renunciation, but the lack of a prior fork where voice/bell trade off keeps the arc short of 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara-7’s interior contradiction—mechanical caretaker haunted by organic static—lands early and drives the burn choice. Yet her “nostalgic” layer is told, not embodied; no memory-flash or sensorial cue shows longing, so the emotional cost feels generic. The final poise is earned, but the arc’s turning point is more concept than lived crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clara’s curator eye is shown in one micro-choice—pocketing the locket—but never tested again; her interiority is generic (“mind already racing”) and the final tears feel performed rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her discovery, so the “earned” closure is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is evocative—ink-stained fingers, breath fogging the visor—but the contradiction between “not here to solve puzzles” and immediately solving puzzles blunts motivation. Embodied emotion is strong early (dice warming, pulse quickening) yet flattens in the climax: no visible tremor, breath, or stumble while dancing under drone fire. The final smile feels unearned because the cost (antidote secured) is logistical, not emotional or bodily. Character is vivid but the arc leans on declaration rather than a palpable, body-level change.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief for his erased wife is palpable in the tactile handling of pressed wildflowers; the object acts as an emotional prosthetic that stays consistent under fluctuating gravity. His micro-choice to lay his flowers beside the salt-rose reconfigures the chamber’s gravity and triggers memory-restoration—an earned turn that scales to the fable-logic of the piece. Internal contradiction—yearning for memory yet fearing its cost—remains mostly told rather than dramatized, muting full high-band resonance. The final stance crystallizes: he accepts stewardship of the chamber, a visible cost paid by relinquishing private reclamation for communal guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The summoner’s interiority is lyrically specific—“terrestrially cosmic” eyes, micro-mapping silence—yet her choices never fork under contradictory impulses; the prophecy is accepted, mapped, fulfilled. No credible alternative path is weighed, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than costly. Still, the embodied ritual detail keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s occupation as “dead-language tutor” is more label than lived; the interiority is generic (“his breath caught”) and no contradictory impulse acts in scene. The woman’s nimble patience is asserted, never embodied under pressure. The final choice to speak to the building is causally thin—no prior flaw or cost makes the refusal or assent meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—“charmed skeptic” who hoards pain yet yearns for release—are embodied in every micro-choice: pressing the shell to earth, arranging the circle, letting sparks burn without flinching. The final stance crystallizes credibly: she walks away lighter not because pain is erased but because she has weaponized it into independence. The “tragically radiant” label is shown, not told, via the garden’s mirrored gaze and her own willed incandescence. Only the mother-abandonment flashback edges toward diagnostic summary, blunting full urgency. Cost is visible: the garden reduced to ash, her shadow a wraith she outgrows.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—precision forger seeking forgiveness, not deception—are live on the page; her micro-choice to prick and bleed for the seal visibly costs her. The heritage thorn as penance/tool and the hair-thread binding the scroll crystallize a hierarchy of values. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic: “tasting of iron and regret.” The Earned Stasis of leaving the scroll and exiting the sanctuary lands because every beat has rehearsed the same renunciation-in-advance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s yearning to understand “why some echo” is vivid, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a micro-choice that costs him something on the page; he listens, climbs, and accepts wisdom without testing or risking his own voice. The final “raise his voice” moment is epiphanic rather than earned—no prior beat shows him tempted to withhold the song. Hooded figure acts as oracle, not pressure source, so relationship crucible is absent. Result: motivation clear, but no visible flaw or trade-off to foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s quiet “gift” and his gentleness are sketched with evocative interiority, but the three dream-visitations are reported, not dramatized, so we never see him make a risky micro-choice under pressure; the final placement of the globe feels like a foregone ritual rather than a costly renunciation. The widow’s dream lands hardest because it re-weights the sailor’s motive, yet Kael’s own stake in exposing vs. withholding the truth remains abstract, muting character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s obsessive attention to unseen labor is viscerally embodied in the net-mending and whisk-handling beats; the contradiction between his philosopher’s detachment and compulsion to decode gives him texture. Interiority stays concrete—never abstracts itself into jargon. Yet no second character enters to test his values under status pressure, so the “relationships as crucible” criterion is moot and the arc is only a quiet crystallization rather than a costly renunciation; the cost is felt but not dramatized as irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's "truth excavator" identity is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page debunking act until the letter reconstruction. The final choice (sacrifice flawed diamond) is credible, but the interior contradiction between truth-seeking and world-saving is only summarized, not shown in scene. Still, her perceptual specificity ("trees leaned...fingers grasping") keeps the score solid.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for isolation yet magnetized by the storm’s voices—is dramatized in scene through micro-adjustments of dials and palm-on-glass tremors. The embodied cost (aching joints, gritty laugh) makes his shift from passive listener to active prism credible. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; lone-POV focus stays sharp. Final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causal chain: static → prophecy → self-revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s scavenger-poet identity is vivid—boots crunching sand, notebook of dog-eared margins—yet his interiority toggles between lyric self-label ("thief of echoes") and Diagnostic-speak ("gnawing need to sweeten the world’s sharp edges"). Micro-choices—opening each jar, the final refusal to hoard the music—are embodied and legible; the cost is the surrender of personal memory to communal air. Contradictory impulse (hoard vs. share) is staged, not summarized, but the climactic renunciation is softened by poetic paraphrase rather than a sharp, felt forfeiture. Still, the arc from solitary collector to public transmitter of grief-earned song is coherent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his gloved hands on the dial, sweat in his collar—and his contradictory gear-head vs. bone-deep mystic impulses collide live in scene. The micro-choice to match the ghost’s wail with the resonator crystallizes his hierarchy: family duty > self-preservation. The earned cost is legible—he staggers, vision blurs—yet the “logically emotional” label is announced rather than dramatized, blunting flaw complexity. Ghost’s bow feels slightly convenient, capping motivation below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—impatience vs. the elders’ mantra—drives every micro-choice; the final “listen” moment crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost (aching back, dawn exhaustion). Flaw: the acolyte beat merely repeats the lesson aloud, adding no new pressure or flaw exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse-synced lantern, the “weight of centuries”—and her shift from compliant pawn to defiant actor is legible. Yet the turn pivots on a single summary paragraph (“She’d been a fool…”) rather than a dramatized beat; the epiphany feels delivered, not earned under pressure. Director Cole remains an off-page label, so the relational crucible is missing and status dynamics unaired. The earned cost is present—she will expose him—but the internal contradiction that triggers it is asserted, not embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s deliberate nature is shown through tactile, quiet choices—tracing the box, murmuring the line about light—but the interior contradiction never crystallizes into a risky micro-choice; he observes and decides off-page rather than risking status or belief under pressure. The clockwork heart momentarily embodies regret, yet Marcus’s reaction remains solicitous, not crucible-tested. The final “apology into action” is declared rather than dramatized; we are told the cost is felt, not shown through a forfeiture or public stance. Interiority is present but stays safe, never exposing a competing impulse that would force visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s obsession with the arrow tip and bell is concrete, embodied, and propels every risky tweak of the *Skein*; her “irreverent awe” is shown in whoops and grins, not labels. Interiority stays sharp and gear-specific (“gears with feet”). The final hurl of the tip is earned—years of stylus tracing pay off in one charged, irreversible act. No contradictory impulses live side-by-side, so the 9-bar misses by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her pulse, the rough fabric under her fingertips—yet the “diagnostic label-speak” on the final beat (“And she was done letting the company erase…”) nudges her into textbook resolve rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to upload coordinates while drones advance is visible and costly, earning her renunciation, but the prior emotional layering is slightly smoothed into a single heroic arc. Still, her attentional bias toward data streams and frayed patch is specific and sustained under pressure. Voice coherence is high; only the closure beat lacks a last contradictory tremor that would cap the arc at 9.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered—“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “quiet fire”—but contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see her tempted toward violence or withdrawal, so the alleged anomaly stays ornamental. Micro-choices (walking the mirror circle, placing the fragment) are ritual, not crucible; no moment forces her to pay or renounce. The earned smile at the end feels un-taxed because no flaw or blind spot is exposed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lila’s numb detachment is concrete: she volunteers for disaster relief to "dull the ache of her purpose," a micro-choice that fuses grief with action. The parasol-tip hooking the antique boat is a perfect externalization of fragility meeting frozen weight. The rescue offers a credible micro-shift—she acts without claiming heroism, letting the earned flicker of peace arrive as stasis rather than cure. Interiority stays specific and avoids label-speak, though the “fold in patience” concept is still somewhat abstract in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet, embodied guardianship and Lila’s painter-block feel lived-in; his “nudge” and her wry smile are micro-choices that shift status. Burned letter as talisman anchors contradictory impulses without glib epiphany. Final shared walk costs them both complacency—Elias risks his solitude, Lila her numbness—earning the closure under a lyrical causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her peripheral awareness feels tactile, not abstract. Yet her motives stay opaque; “preserve the echo” is declared, not dramatized through competing wants. The prophet is a catalyst, not a crucible; no status shift or mutual pressure forces Mara to reveal or rethink anything. The mask drop is honest, but the cost is asserted (“disarming”), not lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lila’s interiority is textured—her perceptual filter for arcs, her ritualized return, the dove-gray case as extension of hand—yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens her calm. The final “enough” is a label, not a tested renunciation; we never see her refuse an actual alternative, so the cost is conceptual, not embodied. Still, the micro-choice to photograph again is earned and particular to her vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his reticence shown through tactile dictionary-touching and pacing—but the “fractured sequences” epiphany is declared more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (returning the crystal) is mild, so the cost feels inferred rather than visible. Still, his embodied emotion and pattern-obsessed worldview stay consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s “precognitively forgetful” trait is stated but never dramatized as a live constraint; he never visibly forgets a vision that then alters tactics. The chalk and driftwood rituals show repetitive behavior rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Interiority drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“tidal longing”) instead of embodied conflict. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows him confronting the cost of remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “steady as star charts,” his humming as a “thread weaving through chaos.” Yet the leap into the portal feels more conceptually required than emotionally foreclosed; we are told the “luminous ache” but not shown its specific cost to him. The contradiction between taming time and surrendering to escape is dramatized in the solder-and-song beats, so the arc earns partial credit.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s “flawless goodbye” motivation is vivid and embodied; her tactile handling of the vinyl shard and micro-choice to give it away crystallize her hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—clinical detachment vs. personal memory—surface, but the interiority slips into therapeutic shorthand (“scent of hope”) that blunts edge. Elias remains a symbol more than a person; his single whispered line is too slight to earn the reunification weight the story assigns. The final gift of the shard is earned, but the cost to Mira feels generalized rather than singular.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: Mira’s renunciation of the shard and adoption of the next case forms a clean Charged Poise with conceptual cost—her perpetual service. Causality is causal-lite; the hymn literally revives Elias, a contrivance the text embraces rather than motivates. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the single-scene window holds. The “blood work” stake is announced early and honored at the bedside, satisfying lens coherence under Causal.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
    <comment>The vinyl fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; the sky-haven is sketched with selective lavender and sunrise cues rather than white-room. Spatial choreography stays clean—turntable, window, hand-off. Professional detail (hospice music therapist) is accurate but ornamental; no choice hinges on it. The shard’s tactile return in the last paragraph charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lirael’s quiet, patient scholarship is embodied in tactile desk work and star-charting; her interiority remains concrete (“bloodshot but sharp”) without label-speak. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—she proceeds steadily—so the required internal friction is missing. The final breakthrough feels inevitable rather than wrested from risk, softening the cost. Still, her perceptual signature (celestial mechanics as thought-rhythm) is individual and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s skepticism-plus-curiosity is etched in tactile micro-choices (testing thorns, palming the tooth) and a credible internal split between needing proof and fearing what she’ll find. Elias’s re-appearance carries visible cost—lined face, “voice rough with disuse”—and their shared history is evoked in one deft clause about getting lost as kids. The closing forgiveness is earned: the fountain’s re-flow parallels the re-alignment of their relationship, and her final line accepts complicity. Missing the 9-band because the “shrewdly innocent” adjective pair is never dramatized in a moment that forces a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically specific (“pause before a star’s light reaches earth”), but contradictions are stated rather than dramatized; the decisive release is motivated by inherited maxims, not an on-page clash of impulses. Micro-choices (selecting the pitted shard, the scale test) are present yet feel pre-ordained by the mother’s voice-over rather than wrestled with. Still, the embodied patience of polishing and the refusal to keep the pearl give the arc credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory fear of “losing him twice” versus her willingness to unclasp the pendant is dramatized in one continuous beat; the moss graft into the amber externalizes the shift with visible cost, earning the lighter-pendant close. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of the pendant lighten”) rather than label-heavy. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: protect relic vs. accept Elias’s offer—she risks the former to secure the latter. Secondary pressure from Elias is present but gentle; still, status tilts when she cedes control of the pendant setting.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s interior contradiction—wanting neat endings yet craving messiness—is cleanly dramatized in the micro-choice to delete the last chapter. Embodied emotion (“the seashell fragment grew warm”) is specific, but the self-diagnostic line “she hated herself for it” edges into label-speak, slightly blunting the beat. The final renunciation is earned and costs her the safety of closure, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically specific—her belief that “secrets hide in the cracks between moments” is a lived perceptual habit, not an aphoristic sticker. The ache in her hands and the tear/sweat mix show embodied cost, and her final micro-choice to plant the seed while inviting the creatures to co-tend is a credible renunciation of solitary genius. Flaw: the creatures’ instant, docile assent flattens status dynamics; she alone drives the turn, so the “community” claim feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is evocative—his measured gestures and tactile ritual reveal a man calibrating himself against cold and failure—but the “clarity he had never known” is asserted, not dramatized, flattening the climax. The contradiction between impatience and ritual is shown early yet never compounds into a mistake that costs him on-page, so the final beat feels slightly gift-wrapped.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s reflective, peripheral focus is shown through his methodical mirror-work and preference for “looking sideways,” but his interiority remains mostly observational; the moment of triumph is reported rather than embodied, so the cost of success feels external. The keepers’ desperation is stated, not staged, so the crucible of relationship never pressures Elias into a visible trade-off. A stronger internal contradiction or a renunciation scene would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s grief-soaked precision—sweat on temples, trembling hands, the locket he still can’t touch—gives embodied contradiction real-time weight; renunciation of his mother’s burden is earned, costly, on-page. Interiority avoids label-speak, stays concrete (“fragile thread in the grotto’s damp throat”). Micro-choices (re-angling flame, deciding not to light the locket) reveal value hierarchy. Only micro-gap: calcified-vanished mother motive is told more than dramatized, slightly blunting flaw-driven mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clara’s grief is embodied in sawdust-scented breath and the tremor of first cut; the internal contradiction—needing the lion to be both memory and muscle—activates every micro-choice. The ash blank as last gift anchors motive, but the epiphanic “This is how we survive” drifts toward label-speak, slightly softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s regret and erosion of ambition are embodied in calloused fingers, the act of dropping the camera, and her final wade into the lagoon; contradictory impulses (cling vs let go) play out in the ghost exchange. The interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic talk—and the final smile feels un-tidy, earned. Micro-choices (plunge, release, wade) telegraph a hierarchy of values with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; head-count clear.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s “functional creativity” is shown, not told—she scavenges conduits, rigs a generator, trades sweat for light. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through spatial/engineering perception. No contradictory impulses on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails, capping at 8.7. Micro-choices (kneeling, rerouting, pocketing the sextant) align with motive and foreclose the “restore-old” path, paying visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—dream of wildness vs life of gears—is embodied early and re-anchored by micro-actions (excruciatingly gentle adjustment, trembling hand on quartz). The bear encounter crystallizes her renunciation of “smallness” with visible cost: she stays inside the keep but forfeits the walls’ power to define her. The moment of earned stasis is understated yet felt; only the diagnostic tag “to make peace with an abandoned dream” flirts with label-speak, slightly blunting the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with “architecture of lies” is vivid and embodied; the sundial warms in his palm, he smiles at the inscription, his boots sink in mud—each micro-action reveals a seeker who risks comfort for truth. Internal contradiction is missing: he never doubts the quest or fears the cost, so the arc is a straight line rather than a crucible. The final beat lands as earned stasis—he stands in the warehouse, revelation “settling in his chest”—but because no alternative path was ever tempted, the cost feels conceptual rather than personal. Still, the voice is specific enough to lift him above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “infinitely patient” hands enact micro-choices (kneeling, brushing snow, coaxing rope) that externalize inner contradiction between belief and failing eyesight; the decision to lay the warm glass beside the rope is a visible, costly renunciation that seals his new stance. Interiority is concrete (“heart racing”), embodied, never diagnostic. The woman’s storm-cloud eyes supply external pressure that sharpens his hierarchy of values. No head-count or status drift; single-POV default met.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s vocation—writing obituaries for the living—gives her a sharp, specific lens, and her kneeling to “listen” to the thread is a vivid micro-choice. Yet the interior contradiction promised by the premise (chronicling absences while craving presence) is stated more than enacted; we never see her tempted to break her own rule, so the arc feels pre-decided. The embodied emotion is strong (“chest ached with lonesome splendor”), but the vanished woman remains a gentle projection rather than a pressure that forces Elara to reorder her map. Earned stasis lands, but the cost is poetic rather than tactical—acceptable at this length, yet not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears streaming,” “bones ache”), but the epiphany-into-orchard pivot is articulated in thematic shorthand (“We’ll grow”) rather than a final micro-choice that costs him something concrete; the renunciation is felt yet not dramatized on-page. Still, motives escalate cleanly from solitary obsession to shared stewardship, satisfying the 9- gate minus the hairline soft landing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-rooted restlessness vs. firefighting need to mend—are dramatized in the micro-choice to lie “This’ll keep her safe” while touching the coin; the splinting beat embodies the arson-daughter guilt and the need to graft new roots. Interiority is concrete (coin weight, sand hiss) rather than label-speak. Earned renunciation is visible: she releases the grain into the lagoon, accepting that scars remain but can sing; the cost is the forever-carry of her father’s stigma. Secondary pressure from Mara’s fear sharpens Lira’s stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s “luminous skeptic” interiority is vivid—her refusal to surrender to silence is embodied in every scraped knuckle—yet the internal contradiction between doubt and belief is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final smile is earned, but the absence of visible cost to her body or future options caps the score. No secondary character pressure to test her stance keeps the arc solitary and slightly under-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lumin’s ache for fire’s warmth is vivid (“heart ached”), but the decisive shift from ancestral shame to hopeful sharing is delivered in a single expository paragraph (“I’ll share it”) rather than through a tense micro-choice under pressure; the gear is handled but never risks or costs Lumin anything on the page, so the renunciation feels pre-scripted, not earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marlow’s interiority is vivid—chisel-calloused hands, lantern flicker in his chest—yet his contradictory impulse (to speak grief vs. to carve it) is declared rather than dramatized in-scene. The final poem is earned, but the prior silence is summarized, so the cost feels literary rather than lived. Voice remains consistent, gravestone craft is textured, but secondary pressure is absent; no one else on stage to force a status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s lineage duty and tactile care for the tower give her a believable stake; the rake-handle discovery triggers a micro-choice that re-weights her stance. Interiority stays concrete (“hands raw,” “throat tightened”) and the final endurance costs her skin and solitude. Yet the ethical-diligent trait is asserted more than tested under competing pressures, and no contradictory impulse complicates her ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s curiosity about “the shape of intentions” anchors every tactile choice—kneading soil, tracing threads—so her final decision to rebury the case feels like the inevitable collision of blithe patience with discovered responsibility. The only slack is the off-stage arrival of the chess-clock beat; we’re told she pauses, not shown her body jolting at the sound, so the moment doesn’t quite crystallize contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lira’s lone POV is interior-rich, her trembling hands and obsessive cataloging of freeze cycles make the “ignorance cartographer” feel lived-in. The contradiction between scientific rigor and superstitious fetish (kingfisher quill) is onstage throughout, driving every micro-choice. The cost—bloodshot eyes, splintered nib, burnt journals—pays for her earned stance. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity remains perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her breath fogging the dial, the pencil snagging—showing a copyist’s tactile precision. The “dust remembers” motive is embodied in frantic transcription and the rare fragile smile, not declared. The only slack is the father memory: delivered as summary rather than sensual flash, so the sailor lore feels inherited, not earned. Still, her final step into the gravel carries earned stasis: she chooses to keep listening, cloak warm with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—needing the mask to erase self while chasing an emotion she refuses to name—lands early and powers every beat. The porcelain mask’s bite into her skin at the end is a crisp embodied cost, earning her renunciation of completion. Without another on-page character exerting status pressure, the relationship crucible is absent, but her self-to-mask dynamic supplies sufficient tension. The final micro-choice—leaving the portrait unfinished—grows logically from the established trait of deliberate omission.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “ache of understanding” and the bleeding hands give us embodied cost, but the interior contradiction—preaching anti-progress while chasing a mechanical grail—stays asserted, not dramatized in a single decisive beat. Mara’s presence supplies external pressure, yet her stance flips from scorn to semi-attendance without a visible micro-choice that changes the relational state. The final image of continued digging is credible endurance, but the emotional turn feels incremental rather than foreclosed by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clara’s motive—braid vanishing voices into harmony—stays clear, but her interiority repeats the same abstract desire without fresh contradiction; the single micro-choice (inviting Elias to play) is gentle, not costly. Elias’s regret is sketched only through label “weight of a man’s regret,” never embodied contradiction. The ending’s “something new could take root” is declared, not dramatized as renunciation or loss; the emotional price is inferred, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s synesthetic gift and “gentle rebellion” motive are vivid, but interiority drifts toward therapeutic self-labeling (“she’d proven that even in a world of rust…”) rather than embodied contradiction under peak pressure. The pruning micro-choices do crystallize values, yet the felt cost is displaced onto the plant; her own bodily risk or forfeiture remains abstract. Still, the occupation-specific sensorium and persistent altruistic drive lift her above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clara’s compulsive honesty is vividly dramatized in her first paragraph and directly shapes her climactic decision to “weaponize” candor at the booth; the contradiction between her bluntness and her yearning to re-enchant the city is felt throughout. Interiority is specific (“It tastes like regret”) and embodied (breath fogging glass). The drones’ failure and the riddle give her an earned pivot that costs her social safety; the final smile shows a credible, stakes-scaled change. Minor: Voss functions more as expositional mouthpiece than secondary pressure, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—“she’d spent years cataloging the subtleties others missed” roots her lens—but contradiction under pressure is only lightly sketched; her decision to sanctify feels more conceptual than costly. The “inadvertently profound” self-tag is diagnostic-speak that flattens voice at the exact beat where embodied complexity is needed. Micro-choices exist (placing each object) yet don’t tighten stakes visibly; the arc is more ritual than irreversible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is sharply particularized through the thread/needle body metaphor and her sensory-filtered memories; the final swallow is earned because her attention has already re-priced “cure” as “catalyst.” Lumen’s motivation stays abstract—its kindness is asserted, never contradicted, so no interior contradiction operates in-scene; the statue functions more as oracle than character. The emotional cost is visible (she drinks, garden breathes), satisfying the 9+ gate for this category, but the living statue falls short of full characterhood.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is evocative—“tarnished silver” eyes, dice as compass, ozone-tasting air—and Kael’s contradictory impulse (motion as surrogate for silence) stays live. Micro-choices are dramatized: counting loops, rolling the chipped die, the fist-rupture, the final refusal to grab the orbiting dice. Earned endurance costs him the only talisman he still possessed, visible on the page: “Let them be.” Flaw remains present (cheating past) but does not complicate the final beat; grim optimism is asserted more than embodied in speech cadence. The 42.7 % figure is the single diagnostic-speak intrusion in an otherwise visceral interior monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lila’s insomnia and painter identity are declared early, but the canvas never dictates her tactical choices; the portrait’s eyes are painted only after Mr. Voss arrives, so the “insomniac painter” trait never alters her agency. The “methodically hopeful” label is asserted (“cataloging kindnesses like fossils”) yet never forces a visible trade-off or error under pressure. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“daydreams sparked”) rather than embodied contradiction, so motivation feels performed, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lila’s impulse to “rescue dying arts” is declared early and re-articulated through bread-making and festival planning, but the interior contradiction between grief and hope is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Micro-choices (handing children dough, lifting “LV” loaf) are visible yet low-stakes; no moment forces her to risk social credit, time, or the lens itself. The final “fragile optimism” is earned, but the cost is atmospheric rather than embodied—no foreclosed path or tangible loss is shown on-page. The lens-carrying gesture could have crystallized a harder trade-off; instead it remains symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with defying time is vivid—his backward clocks, kneeling in wet sand, trembling hands—but the “neatly inventive” trait is asserted more than embodied. The interior contradiction (awe vs terror) is present, yet the final laugh feels unearned because the stakes shift from personal legacy to cosmic horror too abruptly. A single micro-choice—pouring mercury—carries the scene, but the cost (cold stone, shuddering island) is external rather than internalized as irrevocable loss. Still, his pariah-prophet texture and embodied ritual work keep him above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s fear-and-lie paradox is dramatized through the clasp beat, giving us embodied cost. Yet her interiority slips into label-speak (“Your power is an illusion”) that flattens the peak beat. Vey’s opaque motives keep him from exerting crucible pressure; he watches rather than alters. The earned shift in the clasp’s glow lands, but the emotional price feels under-cooked because the prior beat was told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied—her soles damp, mallet pulsing in palm, throat humming—yet the psychic cost of her obsession feels slightly undertested; no contradictory impulse surfaces after the first plank fails. The final smile tastes of “salt and victory,” a tidy abstract where a sharper physical or moral price would have deepened Earned Stasis. Still, her attention hierarchy (clouds > driftwood > apples) is idiosyncratic and consistent, and every micro-choice is filtered through her synesthetic calling. Characterization is strong; it only misses the top band because the climax does not force her to relinquish or doubt the gift she prizes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s quiet obsession with “answers” over bread is shown through tactile obsession with shells and whistle; the interior contradiction—curiosity vs survival—remains vivid. Embodied stress (trembling hands, hitching breath) tracks escalating risk. Final stance crystallizes credibly: she stays to play the whistle, accepting apocalypse-cost foreshadowed by mother’s journal. Micro-choice hierarchy (truth > life) earns its place, though mother's off-page vanishing is a touch too convenient as primal driver.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s historian drive is present from line 1, but her contradictory impulse—whether to expose or protect the compromised truth—only surfaces in the chamber scene. The internal split is named, not embodied; we get no bodily cost or micro-choice that dramatizes the tug. Tomas functions as pressure, yet their status dynamic stays flat; he hands her the final insight rather than forcing her to pay for it. The closure choice (“she would write…as a cautionary parallel”) is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—stoic surveyor vs. sensitive dream-archeologist—are dramatized in the inkwell quiver and the decision to leave a note that smears; the choice to sign the desk feels earned, carrying ancestral and personal cost. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic, and her perceptual signature (compass, silt, algae-veined stone) stays particular. The flaw: the grandmother-link arrives as retrospective gift rather than prior constraint, so the final identity fusion feels slightly convenient, not compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s indexer mindset is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming grooves, sketching spirals—so her “logical” trait alters tactics, not décor. The moment she aligns stamp to indentation and the lock clicks, her professional tool becomes personal agency; stamp weight turning symbol is earned. Interiority stays sensory, avoids label-speak; “quiet confession of failure” lands as embodied cost, not diagnosis. No contradictory impulses in scene, so 9+ gate missed, yet characterization is vivid, specific, and closure-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—"polish until the stone weeps" shows embodied craft—but the brother’s absence keeps relationship pressure off-stage; the final stance-crystallization ("I’m not afraid") is earned yet costs are more conceptual than visceral, capping the 8-band. Still, contradiction ("laugh…brittle as winter ice") and micro-choice (pressing the gem) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—“each fissure a timeline”—and motives stay tethered to grief-rage, but the epiphany “she was a seer. A disrupter” arrives as label, not dramatized turn. Micro-choices (slam console, step into node) show hierarchy of values, yet the shard’s hold on her palm is repeated without new charge. Cost is felt, but the final self-definition is asserted, not earned by visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s drone-pilot acuity and “perpetually surprised” trait are shown through sensory, embodied beats (goggles flicker, breath hitches). She acts: tracks, scans, grips tools, pulls the lever—each micro-choice escalates cost. Interior contradiction is light but present: skepticism vs. star-struck wonder. The final stance—coat tightened, listening—earns a quiet, visible cost: she foregoes certainty for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s guilt is vividly embodied in the trembling watch-hand and the visceral pull toward the driftwood; his decision to break silence is credibly forced by the visions he absorbs. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final renunciation carries visible cost: he walks back to confess, pocketing the cold watch. Flaws (complicity in erasure) actively shape the climax rather than decorate it. Missing higher band: we never see micro-choices under live client pressure; the brother reveal is received, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clara’s interiority is sharp—“between apology and forgiveness, lay the razor’s edge of trust”—and her micro-choice to drop the pull carries earned cost. Yet the fisherman’s son and cartographer remain abstractions; we’re told their fears, not shown how those fears recoil on Clara’s tactics. The final renunciation lands, but the absence of visible stakes from the exchanged weakens the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for star-guided freedom yet fearing adult conformity—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (paddle grip, leaving the compass). Interiority stays embodied (“salt air bit through her jacket”), not diagnostic. The final renunciation feels earned because every beat of regret is tied to a sensory cue and the lighthouse climb literalizes cost. Could edge higher if one earlier beat showed her actively botching a navigation decision on the water rather than only recalling past failures.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s “clean-slate” premise is vivid, but her guilt manifests in abstract labels—“fragments of guilt surfaced like ink”—rather than embodied contradiction. The moment she names J.T. feels telepathic; no sensory cue or prior knowledge justifies the leap. Interiority leans on diagnostic shorthand: “a jaded wonder, fragile but real.” These lapses keep her change evocative yet not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s refusal-to-surrender humanity under duress is dramatized in feather-sprouting flesh; the cost (permanent hybridity) is felt in the final image. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic, and the paradoxical steadiness shows in micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, dipping fingers). “I’m not ready” is a believable blind spot that drives the climax. Only hairline slip: “gift” abstraction mid-paragraph could be embodied one beat earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for her mother while fearing the answer—are embodied in the trembling hand on the cracked saucer; the final traced palm on the cloth shows a paid cost. Interiority stays concrete (“the phrase tasting of ash and honey”). The Earned Stasis of accepting that repentance is a choice, not a place, is fully motivated by the vision in the glass city. Only the slight over-articulation of “willingly perplexed” keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s pacifism is active—she refuses the weapon, faces the AI’s challenge, and chooses to stitch with words, embodying Earned Stasis. The gravitational lightness is shown only in her floating laugh; it never constrains a tactical choice, so the trait stays ornamental. Interiority is rich and embodied (“hands that trembled only when she laughed”), but the lack of physical cost keeps her arc just shy of highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interiority is evocative—her empty pockets/full heart paradox and trembling hands—but her contradictory impulses stay summarized (“I just… wanted to fix things”) rather than enacted in a single visible micro-choice under pressure. The final shift to “purpose, not just habit” is declared, not dramatized; we see no immediate behavioral cost or renunciation that forecloses her old pattern. Relationship/status dynamics are absent; the hooded man functions as oracle, not crucible. Overall competence balanced with genuine struggle is asserted, not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kieran’s vigilance and Elara’s inventiveness are sketched efficiently, but internal contradiction is thin; both feel like cooperative plot avatars rather than individuals with clashing stakes. The quill-holder choice is concrete, yet no micro-choice dramatizes real risk or personal flaw. Their partnership is cordial, so status crucible never ignites. Closure relies on communal uplift, not a personally-costed stance, so earned stasis is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s grief-linked vocation and precognitive burden give her a sharp interior contradiction; the “listen, don’t solve” renunciation is earned. Yet the eels remain symbolic scenery—never once bite, slip, or tax her body—so the occupational crucible feels theoretical, not lived. Still, her micro-choices (theta rock, Möbius reordering) visibly track a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradiction-rich: “furiously tranquil” is lived, not labeled. The envelope/timetable object anchors micro-choices—open, read, write back—each with visible cost (ash-choked filter, aching scars). Renunciation of masked poetry is earned: he seals the new poem with wax from his sole light, foreclosing anonymity. No head-count or relationship pressure on page; single-POV focus stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s mechanical-arm micro-gestures and Elyra’s blade-adjustments give embodied contradiction, but interiority tilts toward label-speak (“chaos is honesty”). The final shared grin and “I evolve” renunciation is earned, yet the arm’s loss-origin is told not shown, blunting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cedar’s contradictory impulses—clutching the tin for identity yet yearning to outgrow its cycle—play out in embodied beats: the trembling lift of *Leaves of Grass*, the floorboard hiding ritual, the quill dip that accepts anarchy. Monthly molting is more label than dramatized cost until the final poem appears, but the moment he re-reads “become the anarchy” and smiles, we see earned acceptance of flux. Interior voice stays concrete, never diagnostic; the friendship with Marla offers pressure but not full crucible. Cap at 8.7 because the decisive internal shift is legible yet the price (what he forfeits by embracing chaos) is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clara’s interiority is lush—her tactile piano ritual, the smear on glass, her bristle at “strategically creative” show a lived contradiction between control and surrender. Yet her improvisational flaw never visibly trips her; the hidden piano offers relief, not reckoning. The final “surprise fate” remains an assertion, not a costly renunciation shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically sketched—her perceptual lens is vivid—but we never see contradictory impulses acting at once; doubt is declared (“luminous doubt washed over Lira”) rather than embodied in tense micro-choices. The single decisive act—pressing then surrendering the seed—holds, yet the cost feels conceptual, not personal; she smiles immediately after, muting any felt forfeiture. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status crucible is N/A. Overall, a strong poetic consciousness, but emotional stakes remain safely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Yorick’s calm, rooted persona and Lira’s grief-driven urgency read distinctly, but the interior contradiction promised by “cerulean regret” never surfaces in scene; both remain exactly who they appear to be from entrance to exit. The ghost-father’s sudden forgiveness feels convenient rather than compelled by prior flaw or pressure, so the emotional cost is announced, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her scientific lens filters perception (“waveform of a dying pulsar,” “dust as language”) without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (scraping dust, ignoring the institute) reveal a hierarchy of values: observation over validation, process over prestige. The final renunciation of institutional expectations is earned by her gradual reorientation to decay’s “quiet language.” However, emotional contradiction remains slightly muted; her humility feels more epiphanic than wrestled from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her glasswork metaphors, frayed creativity, and tactile responses to frost feel character-specific. Her motivation to “discover purpose in the pauses” emerges organically from trauma and artistic identity. The final choice—to teach others to read frost—is earned by her prior perceptual training and hollowed post-survival state. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“ache to fill the silence”) without deeper contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s trauma and motivation are embodied with precision—her trembling hands, soundless laugh, and reliance on gesture convey interiority without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (e.g., initiating written notes, fine-tuning forks despite fear) reveal a hierarchy of values: expression over safety, connection over isolation. Elias functions as a crucible, not a fixer; their silent rapport deepens her agency rather than resolving it externally. The final renunciation of voice-as-validation is earned through cumulative, tactile experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s stubbornness and grief are embodied through tactile detail (calloused hands, shard in palm) and micro-choices (resisting Marisol’s stories, staying to mend books). His arc from “rest as end” to “rest as beginning” is earned via the gold-mended lens and childhood dream. Interior contradiction—clinging to permanence while burying the dead—is consistent and crystallizes in his final renunciation of surface life. Flawed but not hedged; his emotional calibration avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to transform survival into solidarity. Her internal conflict—balancing communal fear against the need for trust—is embodied in micro-choices like ringing the bell and naming donors. The final line (“And who listens”) crystallizes her arc without overstatement. Minor deduction: secondary characters lack individualized interiority, though choreography remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is rooted in a coherent spiritual curiosity, and her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, favoring embodied sensation (e.g., breath, taste, warmth). However, her transformation lacks contradictory impulses—her choices flow too smoothly from insight to action without internal friction. The pilgrim memory informs but doesn’t complicate her present decisions, flattening emotional stakes. Final renunciation feels earned but costless; no path is truly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to touch time as fabric—is vividly embodied through her tactile engagement with the garden, photographs, and halo fragment. Her retrocognitive trait fuels contradictory impulses: a hunger for clarity versus fear of dissolution. The final renunciation (“time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story to be told”) feels earned by her sensory overload and the garden’s collapse. However, her internal conflict leans slightly more on poetic abstraction than concrete psychological friction under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is vividly embodied—her chains, the vial, the arrow—and her final renunciation (shattering the seeds) crystallizes her role as liberator with tangible cost. Contradictory impulses (patience vs urgency, self-preservation vs sacrifice) operate simultaneously during key beats. However, her internal conflict leans slightly declarative (“motivation burned in her chest”) rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under duress. The chains snapping at climax feels earned but borders on symbolic convenience without prior physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—forging the sound of betrayal to fill her mother’s silence and recover her father’s disappearance—is rooted in specific, embodied history. Her synesthetic hearing shapes micro-choices (e.g., selecting roots, stirring absences) with visible cost. Internal contradiction pulses between scientific rigor and emotional desperation, especially when she severs the root: a tactile act charged with both hope and self-harm. However, the final smile (“battered but marveling”) risks tipping into unearned epiphany without deeper hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her sweat-slick gloves, the smirk under her hat—and her contradictory impulses (thief vs. giver) culminate in a credible, costly choice: offering her mother’s photo. The final renunciation (“left something better”) feels earned by her quietly savvy ethos and prior actions. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile detail (wilted lily, jar’s warmth). Her flaw—hoarding stolen moments—directly complicates the climax and is transcended without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his calloused fingers, glassblowing philosophy, and grief over his mentor ground his motives in tactile detail. His contradictory impulses (abandonment vs. preservation) act simultaneously during the search, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of “perfect answers” feels earned through prior micro-choices (e.g., narrating tasks, reinterpreting the crack). However, his emotional shift lacks a visible cost beyond abstract “lighter steps,” slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s phobias and adaptive resilience create compelling internal contradiction, embodied in trembling legs that still move toward danger. Her final confrontation reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over safety—with visible cost in severed trust. The mother’s reappearance risks sentimentality but avoids it through withheld reconciliation (“Not yet. First, you have to earn it”). Minor slip: the enforcer’s sudden confession feels slightly convenient, though notes provide plausible leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s obsession with silence is embodied in tactile, specific actions—tracing cracks, sketching with shell ink—and her contradictory impulses (to capture vs. accept impermanence) manifest simultaneously in her handling of the shedding gold flakes. Her motivation stems from a consistent, character-particular trait, not abstraction, and culminates in a credible renunciation: she lets the map be imperfect, embracing decay as part of its truth. The final choice—rolling the scroll and walking away—feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her aching fingers and vanished starlight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through sensory labor and resistance of materials.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit-17’s motivation—to find where thoughts come from—is compellingly rooted in its post-procedure curiosity and drives every action, culminating in a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) that forecloses passive janitorial existence with visible cost: the burden of omnitemporal awareness. Interiority is concrete (“processors whirred,” “logic core flickered”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, the robot’s emotional progression lacks contradiction; it remains “remarkably composed” without internal friction between data and dawning sentience, softening the stakes of self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meticulousness, discomfort with silence, and latent curiosity drive micro-choices (e.g., fetching the lens, following the map). Lira’s presence forces a credible reconfiguration of his worldview without over-explaining. His shift from record-keeper to “translator of silence” feels earned through embodied actions, not epiphany. However, Lira remains slightly archetypal—her motives are clear but her contradictions aren’t dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her hands, marbles, and vine-tending reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in tactile wisdom over algorithmic precision. Joren’s arc feels slightly underdeveloped; his shift from skepticism to marble-polishing lacks micro-choices that show internal contradiction. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak and shows emotion through action (e.g., redirecting vines to block sensors). However, Elara’s “wisely pragmatic” trait borders on idealized competence without visible struggle or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Veyra’s interiority is vividly embodied—thermal gauntlets clicking, breath fogging her visor—and her micro-choices under pressure (rerouting energy flow during destabilization) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her motivation leans heavily on the director’s cryptic prompt (“Time moves sideways”) without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle; her competence borders on effortless, flattening emotional risk. The final smile feels earned but lacks a visible cost that reconfigures her prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation—driven by skepticism, artistic longing, and ghostly obsession—is consistent and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is embodied (“hands trembled,” “breath quickened”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final vow (“I’ll finish it”) emerges from prior micro-choices (decoding symbols, risking submersion) and carries felt cost: she commits to a spectral burden with no guarantee of success or recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her smudging, pacing, and tactile engagement with the illustration reveal contradictory impulses (precision vs. intuition) without diagnostic self-awareness. Her final choice to descend is earned through escalating micro-choices (stealing maps, redrawing roots) that foreclose her role as oracle with tangible cost. The director functions effectively as off-page pressure; no extraneous characters dilute focus. Her flaw—rigid certainty—is authentically destabilized by fever, not conveniently overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s recklessness and skepticism are embodied in concrete choices—the valve wheel as talisman, descending despite fear—and his internal contradiction (dismissing ghosts yet chasing whispers) drives the arc. His final renunciation—leaving the valve—feels earned, with visible cost: the burden of truth too heavy to carry. However, the transition from skeptic to believer lacks a micro-beat showing cognitive dissonance mid-revelation; his shift feels slightly abrupt at the hologram moment. Still, his flawed pursuit and moral endurance satisfy Earned Stasis under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicle keeper’s motivation—to witness change without judgment—is embodied through concrete, escalating choices (e.g., unfolding the swan, shedding layers of self in the black pool). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (“fingers trembled,” “hands scraping against stone”). The final renunciation feels earned: their loosening grip on reality culminates in Earned Stasis, with visible cost (abandoning identity, returning to a transformed library). Contradictory impulses—desire for silence vs. duty to record—are active throughout, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent, with micro-choices (offering the curl, playing cello) revealing her values under pressure. Mara’s skepticism-to-wonder arc feels earned through concrete beats, not summary. Their dynamic shifts credibly: Mara’s final acceptance (“I’ll keep it”) carries quiet cost—abandoning her default cynicism. The “softly adaptive” trait manifests in Elara’s responses without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the environment, and his internal conflict—between belief in lost stories and the silence that threatens them—drives every micro-choice. His sensitivity feels particular, not generic, and Clara’s off-page presence exerts pressure without diluting focus. The final act of acknowledgment is earned by his consistent attention to fragments, though the emotional shift at climax borders on epiphanic without sufficient prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—transposing her life into a new key—is credibly rooted in inherited trauma and intellectual legacy, not abstract yearning. Her internal conflict (duty vs. autonomy) manifests in embodied choices: trembling hands, steady hands, the flare as signal. The father’s letters deepen rather than dictate her arc, and her final act (writing a blank fortune) shows earned agency. Minor deduction for slight emotional summarization in “motivation crystallized,” which edges toward diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The priest’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving increasingly complex rhetorical acts. His interiority is vividly embodied through sensory engagement with the palette, pedal, and indigo paint, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. However, his emotional state remains somewhat monolithic; we see conviction but little contradictory impulse or struggle beneath the performance. The final renunciation feels earned, yet lacks a palpable cost beyond conceptual victory.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is richly embodied—her “chronological homesickness,” tactile engagement with the nautilus, and emotional contradictions (longing vs. creative urgency) feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (writing before exhaustion hits, holding the shell to her ear) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: time slipping away, energy waning. However, her motivation borders on abstract (“conductor of unheard symphonies”) without concrete friction in action; the story leans into lyricism over dramatized struggle, slightly softening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s internal contradiction—desiring connection yet floating above it—is embodied consistently, especially in her hesitation before choosing the right path. Her final descent feels earned through layered self-confrontation across timelines. However, some emotional transitions (e.g., from vigilante despair to childhood memory) rely on summary rather than micro-beats under pressure, slightly flattening causality. The cost of her choice is felt but not fully dramatized in bodily detail at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s motivation—emotional numbness as a deaf music teacher—is embodied through tactile perception (“numb hands,” “hollow chest”) and credible micro-choices (returning to the cavern, selecting Coltrane). Her internal contradiction—yearning for sound yet finding refuge in silence—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of the broken needle as a “gift” feels earned, with visible cost in her months of isolation. Elias functions effectively as secondary pressure without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation evolves credibly from data-driven solitude to moral witness, anchored in embodied choices (e.g., climbing the trellis, accepting the vial). His internal contradiction—trusting instruments over intuition until both align—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost: he burns the note, choosing action over archival purity. His flaw (excessive reliance on order) directly enables his transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensory reactions and micro-choices (e.g., hovering fingers, uncorking the vial), avoiding diagnostic labels. Her aromatically cautious trait fuels authentic hesitation and grief, culminating in a credible reconfiguration of her relationship to sorrow. The inherited-memory revelation risks sentimentality but is anchored by the specific vision of the seed-packing woman. Final renunciation of fear feels earned, though the “DNA” phrasing slightly over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior conflict—between flight and commitment, art and survival—is embodied through tactile choices (untying knots, tracing rope) rather than abstract reflection. His “ethically playful” trait surfaces in dialogue but lacks on-page tradeoffs that alter tactics; it reads more as label than lived constraint. The final act of unraveling feels earned by prior accumulation of regret, though the thief backstory risks sentimentality. Flawed yet coherent, he avoids diagnostic self-awareness even at peak vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is compellingly embodied through her tactile interaction with the violin and bowl, and her emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak. Her acoustically perceptive trait informs micro-choices (e.g., positioning the violin over the bowl) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the crowd remains a monolithic chorus rather than individuals applying pressure, limiting relational crucible depth. The final renunciation of silence as a “wall” is earned, but the internal contradiction between grief and hope could be more simultaneous than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, with interior contradiction subtly rendered through his “affectionate detachment” and moral calculus around half-truths. His micro-choices—offering the blotter petal, selecting *Eclipsed Memories*—reveal a hierarchy of values: empathy over honesty, artistry over profit. However, Lira remains underdeveloped beyond her weariness; her role serves Elias’s arc more than her own agency. The final renunciation (accepting partial forgetting) feels earned but lacks deeper friction or cost beyond abstract sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “restless” mind loops between freight rates and unspoken ache, grounding her emotional shift in professional identity. Her micro-choices (tucking the envelope, forging the letter) reveal a hierarchy of values: compassion over efficiency. The locket triggers authentic memory, not epiphany, and her flaw—absorption in work—drives the initial oversight and later repair. Final renunciation of transactional thinking feels earned through concrete action, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—“to graft himself onto community”—is rooted in his “boldly sympathetic” nature and drives every action, culminating in a credible emotional shift upon discovering Lira is Veyra. His interiority is embodied (“luminescent ache,” stained hands) and avoids diagnostic labels. The revelation feels earned because his pursuit stems from consistent values, not plot convenience. However, Lira’s interior remains underexplored, limiting full crucible dynamics despite their shared closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motivation—driven by professional curiosity and ancestral legacy—is clear and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through embodied choices: skepticism warring with wonder, fear yielding to courage. The final act of sketching the giant as “a weary parent” earns emotional weight through prior micro-choices (testing the pendant, leaning into the fissure). Flawed yet capable, she remains consistent without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—ambiguous loss tied to her brother’s disappearance—is vividly embodied through the glass eyes and mosaic ritual, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her interior contradiction (desire for resolution vs. fear of finality) manifests in tactile micro-choices: aligning chips, pouring sap, trembling touch. The memory beat is anchored by present stimuli (the fogged glass), and her epiphany emerges from sensory experience, not abstraction. Her gently inventive trait shapes action with cost—she risks emotional collapse to pursue a fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in kindness and invisibility—is consistent and intensifies credibly when the tape reel promises visibility for others. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers calloused,” “breath fogging the metal”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her shift from observer to “messenger” leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene; the choice feels earned but lacks a visible tradeoff or renunciation that would ground its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she clings to control yet yearns for transformation, embodied in her hesitation before the hellebore. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring insight in tactile observation (“They’re not trying to survive. They’re trying to transform”). Mara functions effectively as a pressure source, though her role leans slightly functional. The final renunciation of control feels earned through prior micro-choices (withdrawing her hand, watching rather than intervening).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marin’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied insomnia and painterly perception, with micro-choices—like following rain trails or grinding amber—that reveal her hierarchy of values. The stranger functions as a pressure-applying foil without over-explaining, and the wry earnestness feels character-specific. However, the final renunciation lacks a visible cost beyond emotional ease; the insomnia “eased” reads more like relief than earned stasis with sacrifice. Contradictory impulses (seeking meaning vs. fleeing memory) animate early beats but soften at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath catching, fingers brushing crystal—and her micro-choice to accept the pearl reveals a hierarchy of values (curiosity over caution) with immediate cost. The pilgrim’s enigmatic presence functions as pressure rather than full characterization, which fits scope. However, his motives remain abstract, and Elara’s shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves from surprise to acceptance without visible struggle, slightly undercutting motivation depth required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her tactile engagement with the valve, journal, and locket reveals a character shaped by absence. However, her internal contradictions remain underexplored; she operates with near-perfect competence, lacking genuine struggle or blind spots that would deepen her arc. The fisherman and girl serve as memory conduits but don’t pressure her emotionally or morally. Her final endurance feels earned but slightly frictionless, missing a micro-choice that forecloses a personal path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—meticulous cartographer vs. yearning dreamer—is embodied in tactile choices (tracing cracks, using the ticket punch) and crystallizes in his final acceptance of unmapped paths. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; instead, trembling hands and breath-fogged air convey vulnerability. The veiled woman functions as a projection of his buried desire, not a fully realized secondary character, but this fits the single-POV scope. His renunciation of total control is earned through prior obsession, with cost felt in the relinquishing of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s interiority is richly embodied—her skepticism, loneliness, and yearning for clarity feel specific and grounded. Her micro-choices (descending the stairs, transcribing the tile) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over fear, connection over isolation. The memory transfer avoids epiphany by anchoring revelation in tactile action (tracing grooves). However, Aelia’s backstory arrives with minimal friction; Clara accepts entangled memories too readily for a “sympathetic skeptic,” slightly softening motivation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s immortality-driven ennui and fear of the unknown are embodied with specificity (“boredom shattered,” “breath hitched—a rare sensation”), and his final choice to embrace uncertainty feels earned. Lira is less developed but functions effectively as a mirror and catalyst. The hesitation before joining fragments reveals layered motivation—fear versus longing—with visible cost in the hollow alternate self. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory and spatial cues over abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her reliance on math, distrust of appearances, and embodied fear (“fingers tightened around the ink pot”) feel authentic. Her final choice to trade the scroll for asylum is earned through prior causality (father’s lessons, ink-induced clarity) and carries visible cost: she risks everything on a con artist’s promise. The agents’ pressure forces micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. However, the father’s moral ambiguity remains underexplored, slightly softening the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Althea’s interiority is vivid and consistent—her calloused hands, violet-pine paste, and belief in textures as memory ground her motivation in tactile specificity. Her contradiction (studious restraint vs. fervent invention) manifests physically in trembling hands and frantic writing. The final renunciation isn’t explicit, but her endurance—returning daily to chart hums—constitutes Earned Stasis with opportunity cost (isolation, eccentricity). However, the lack of a decisive micro-choice under pressure (e.g., choosing notepad over lamp, or resisting the hum) slightly limits causal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael/Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his synesthetic perception, tactile handling of fragments, and micro-choices (e.g., following men, prying open the locket) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. His contradiction—craving identity yet fearing what it entails—is dramatized through action, not summary. The final renunciation (“no longer afraid”) feels earned by accumulated pressure. However, his emotional shift at the climax lacks a visible cost beyond resolve, slightly undercutting full Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “gloomy cheerfulness,” tactile handling of the shell, and reimagined conversations reveal a mind wrestling logic with longing. Her motivation (to validate the astronomer’s riddle) intensifies credibly, culminating in a choice that trades debunking for belief. The final grin “despite the ache” shows contradictory impulses coexisting without resolution. Flaws feel lived-in, not decorative, and her arc earns its emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s internal conflict—dual allegiance to both carnival soul and corporate order—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., decoding graffiti, deploying the chip) rather than stated abstraction. Her orderly intuition directly shapes tactics, and her moral ambiguity feels lived-in, not balanced for safety. Jax serves as effective secondary pressure without overshadowing her agency. The final renunciation (“leave this place alone”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: ongoing tension with the Council.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—rooted in familial legacy and quiet defiance of automation—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her “purposefully curious” trait drives concrete micro-choices (decoding notes, positioning the vial) with visible cost: isolation, obsolescence, emotional exposure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; her trembling gloves and fogged visor convey emotion physically. The final renunciation—walking away as drones arrive—is earned by prior causality and forecloses her role with melancholic dignity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception and professional intuition, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her blindness informs but doesn’t define her competence—she “sees” via vibration, heat, and refracted light, a credible, consistent trait. The micro-choice to trust the water basin over pure logic reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in mentorship and sensory wisdom. Marlow functions as effective secondary pressure, his status as retired engineer lending weight without overshadowing Lira’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s motivation—to find rivers’ “reasons,” not just sources—is vividly embodied and drives every choice, from her reliance on the phrasebook to her trek across the ice. Her dry wit and subtle confidence manifest in action (“Only if the rivers stop flowing”) rather than exposition. The final renunciation—“Maps are lies”—feels earned through her lived discovery of living rivers. Jorn functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting Clara’s singular arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—restoring balance through rhythm—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (striking the fork, kneeling, listening) rather than abstract longing. His patience isn’t passive; it’s active endurance that forecloses haste, with cost implied in his solitude and calloused hands. The townsfolk’s cautious return reveals his influence without dialogue, showing how his method reshapes their agency. No internal contradiction is needed; his singular focus *is* the character, rendered with poetic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in a desire to “harness the ephemeral,” and her internal conflict—between instinct to smash the vial and the temple’s demand for patience—is rendered with embodied tension. Her micro-choice to override action in favor of stillness feels earned and reveals a hierarchy of values (preservation over extraction). However, the backstory surge (“crown she’d never worn”) leans slightly toward unearned mystique rather than grounded character history, risking diagnostic abstraction mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in a potent filial legacy of deceit, and his internal conflict—between truth and inherited myth—is embodied through tactile interaction with the lattice and spatial navigation of the prison. His micro-choices (clutching the lattice, hovering, placing it beside his father’s) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The doppelgänger confrontation crystallizes his arc without over-explaining, and the final renunciation (“I’m not running. I’m writing”) earns its poise through prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains physical and contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ghost bride’s layered motivation—grief, vengeance, and reluctant mercy—is embodied through precise sensory details (e.g., “veil of smoke-gray silk,” “fingers brushing the cold air”) and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses her eternal vigil with palpable cost. Elara’s arc is lean but credible: her curiosity-driven agency triggers the climax, and her trembling yet decisive act (“held the bead aloft”) reveals a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction thrums in the ghost’s “loving and venomous” smile and final dissolution—a refusal to linger that costs her existence. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains tactile and ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—carving reverence from ruin through thread—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action. Her interiority is poetic yet concrete (“fingers raw but steady,” “heart hauntingly optimistic”), avoiding diagnostic abstraction. The sleepwalker encounter reveals her silent pact-making, showing how her method shapes micro-choices under pressure. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible contradiction or struggle beyond steadfastness, slightly softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “cautious enchantment” manifests in embodied choices (e.g., speaking to bones, pausing at roots). Her motivation—restoring faith—is filtered through personal grief and doubt, not abstraction. The final choice to follow faith feels earned by prior micro-decisions (clearing debris, aligning the sundial). However, her internal contradiction (“didn’t fully believe them—not yet”) lacks simultaneous tension; belief shifts too cleanly without active resistance during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is rooted in personal history and deepened by her grandmother’s legacy, with micro-choices (e.g., scanning margins before opening the letter) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile engagement with chalk, water, and paper. The final decision to “teach the children to code in chalk” feels earned, closing one path (private decryption) while opening another with visible cost: continued anonymity in service of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zara’s motivation—preserving lost celestial knowledge as covert resistance—is consistent and embodied through her meticulous stitching and strategic foolishness. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing tension through tactile details (trembling fingers, humming songs). Jaxon’s presence sharpens her choices without flattening her agency. The final act of holding the flame to the embroidery crystallizes her role as guardian of hidden truth with visible cost: she risks exposure to activate the chart’s message.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation—recovering unsaid words—is embodied through tactile actions (tracing condensation, handling the shard) and internal contradiction: she seeks healing but denies needing it. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; grief manifests as physical sensation (“throat tighten,” “warmth in her chest”). The final renunciation—carrying regrets as reminders, not burdens—is earned by prior micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, staying till dawn). Flaws feel lived-in, not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “lotus-hearted ache,” tactile engagement with coral, and micro-choices (tracing condensation, translating scribbles) reveal layered contradiction between professional detachment and emotional vulnerability. Her motivation—to graft meaning onto ruins—is consistent and intensifies through concrete action. The general’s interaction validates her arc without overstatement. Minor deduction: the child exists mostly as off-stage catalyst, slightly thinning relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation to rediscover lost joy is embodied through tactile choices—scavenging, painting with light, displaying the fragment—and deepens credibly as external validation (Marla’s recognition) catalyzes internal change. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic label-speak; joy returns as “a living thing,” not an epiphany. The final grin and “Everything” feel earned by her prior renunciation of elegiac art. Minor deduction: secondary characters lack individual pressure beyond thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marisol’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grandfather’s legacy, her tactile relationship with pigment and sound, and her “methodically playful” ethos cohere into a specific, flawed sensibility. Her micro-choices (angling the dish, whispering to the mural) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over control. The final beat—slipping the nickel away, accepting rhythm over resolution—feels earned by her inherited restlessness. However, Dr. Lysander remains slightly archetypal; his pressure on Marisol is thematic more than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—defiance masked as academic curiosity—is consistent and embodied through ink-stained fingers, poetic quotes, and garden-based subversion. His internal conflict (scholar vs. saboteur) manifests in micro-choices like quoting Lillian’s phrase back to her. Lillian’s piercing gaze and selective trust reveal her own stakes without over-exposition. However, secondary characters remain lightly sketched, and Elias’s “spark of defiance” lacks a tangible personal cost beyond abstract idealism.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is embodied in trembling hands, sleepless scribbling, and moss-lined solitude. Her internal contradiction (shield vs. bridge) manifests physically and poetically, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses insomnia with visible cost: centuries of exhaustion surrendered to trust. The postcard catalyzes change without overriding agency; her micro-choices (venturing outside, planting the seed) reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains tactile (“clutched it to her chest, her breath catching”).

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “foxglove regret,” systematic care, and quiet defiance feel lived-in, not labeled. Her micro-choices (dismantling the chime, singing the lullaby) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation through evolution, not stasis. The contradiction between duty and invention pulses in every action. Final renunciation of “perfect repair” for “remade song” is earned by her tactile, emotional engagement with legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, trembling voice, the crumpled invitation—and her “carefully reckless” trait drives concrete choices (e.g., pursuing translation against Henrik’s skepticism). Her motivation to restore trust with Mira fuels every action, and the final phone call feels earned through accumulated vulnerability. The emotional contradiction between scholarly control and relational fear is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. Cost is visible: years of silence, now risked in one fragile outreach.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her slyly heartfelt nature, tactile engagement with tools, and emotional contradictions feel authentic. Her micro-choices (measuring adhesive, humming her grandfather’s tune) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the “encrypted compassion” concept leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak in the climax (“a confession—a plea for understanding”), risking abstraction over dramatization. Still, her final act of reading aloud earns emotional payoff without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling fingers, chest tightening, dust-mote mapping—and his contradictions (truth vs. reinvention, caution vs. curiosity) drive micro-choices like ignoring clients to decode the chip. His grandfather’s legacy isn’t just backstory; it actively shapes his present risk-taking. The final decision to deliver the chip himself feels earned, with visible cost in abandoned livelihood and emotional exposure. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars his flawed, specific humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her tactile reading of wood grain, her decoding of weather codes as emotional cartography, and her “featherly determined” resolve all reveal a coherent, embodied psyche under pressure. Her final choice to step through the door is earned by prior micro-choices (trusting grain over path, writing her own code) and carries the cost of irreversible departure. The father’s brief presence crystallizes their shared history without flattening either character. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her belief in “rhythm” and longing for belonging manifest through tactile choices (handling the feather, initiating the shared exhale). Her contradiction between surface nostalgia and deep-sea commitment feels lived-in, not abstract. However, secondary characters remain impressionistic; their shift from skepticism to awe lacks individualized pressure or micro-choices, flattening relational stakes. The final realization about belonging reads earned but borders on diagnostic (“grand, chaotic symphony”) without deeper flaw confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—cheerful gloom, hope tinged with resignation—is vividly embodied and consistent. Her micro-choices (pressing seeds into glass, walking to the geode’s heart) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in her role as recollectionist. Motivation is clear and intensifies through tactile interaction with shards and seeds. However, the final realization arrives with minimal struggle or resistance, slightly undercutting the earnedness of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s analytical nature and "lightly attentive" demeanor are embodied through precise observation and micro-choices (e.g., noting trajectories, adjusting bow tension). Her motivation—to disrupt monotony through orchestrated randomness—is consistent and drives her pivotal decision to play discordantly. The teen’s compass rose tattoo subtly mirrors her thematic stance without over-explaining. However, the final renunciation lacks a tangible cost; applause and collaboration feel like reward, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation—renewing her fading constellations—is rooted in consistent traits (tide dancer, cosmic scribe) and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (fledge vs. anchor) manifests simultaneously in embodied gestures, not alternating summaries. The final act of writing the verse is earned by prior causality: the stolen dust, the dance, the ache. No diagnostic label-speak; pain is welcomed as proof of existence, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile detail and profession-specific perception, grounding her epiphany in lived experience. Her motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is consistent and embodied via the prism and ripples. However, her “noctilucent reckonings” verge on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the emotional arc leans tidy rather than fraught. The final notebook jotting feels slightly expository, softening the cost of her insight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scarred face, the weight of guilt, and tactile interactions with the box ground his emotional arc. His contradictory impulses (self-blame vs. yearning for peace) act simultaneously during the hourglass moment. The final choice—to walk downslope “enlightened”—is earned by prior causality and carries the felt cost of relinquishing self-punishment. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“You are not broken”) that borders on unearned articulation mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “logical dreamer,” and her micro-choices—tying threads, igniting the balloon, interpreting the gauge—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on hope-as-equation. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile engagement with tools and environment. The silver thread from her own hair introduces a personal cost that deepens stakes without melodrama. However, the absence of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (e.g., doubt vs. determination clashing in real time) prevents full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—rooted in childhood stories and sharpened by climate grief—feels deeply personal and consistent. Her micro-choices (kneeling to sift ash, placing the film in fire) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over preservation, transmission over hoarding. The final locket revelation lands because it’s earned through tactile engagement, not epiphany. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied in breath, tremor, and touch.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation—reaching her dead sister through mirrors—is clear, emotionally grounded, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is vividly embodied: sweat, heaving chest, trembling locket heartbeat. The borrowed heartbeat and coded lullabies reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; her calm masks grief, not suppresses it.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied contradictions—her “operatively gentle” hands versus calluses from past pacts—and micro-choices (e.g., tracing the clipboard) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to anchor ideals in practice is dramatized through active negotiation tactics, not just stated. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“the price of redemption… flawed beauty in compromise”) without sufficient irrationality or hypocrisy to feel fully human in crisis. The final renunciation—accepting an imperfect treaty—is earned but lacks a decisive internal fracture that would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The philanthropist’s contradictory impulses—amoral destruction versus secret sentimentality—are embodied in concrete actions (stealing the egg, pouring river water) rather than stated. His micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: he preserves only an echo, not life itself. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (“salt crunching beneath his knees”) and private ritual. The final renunciation—walking away without checking the egg’s fate—is earned by prior causality and reflects a credible endurance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation is vividly rooted in resistance to conformity, and her bodily poetic form serves as both identity and rebellion. Her internal conflict—between imposed silence and expressive truth—is embodied rather than summarized, especially in the dance sequence. However, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible testing, and the “chaste courtesan” archetype risks tokenism without deeper socio-historical grounding. The final renunciation (carrying echoes as resistance) is earned, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior conflict—between artistic integrity and complicity—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., rehearsing lines, manipulating puppets) and anchored in his backstory without therapy-speak. His serenity reads as a practiced armor, not detachment, and his final renunciation of “full truth” feels earned. Mara’s brief but pointed interjection tests his stance without flattening her into foil. Flaw: the drifter’s scoff lacks individuation, slightly weakening secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, aching fingers, and breath cadence convey emotion without diagnostic labels. Her motivation (honoring overlooked deaths) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices like precise knotting under physical strain. The final renunciation—accepting the lattice’s impermanence—is earned by her prior actions and worldview. However, internal contradiction is muted; her esoteric realism lacks counter-pressure that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—preserving erased voices—is deeply rooted in personal trauma and consistently drives his actions. His interiority is concrete (“hands raw but steady,” “fingers...trembled”), and his flawed, scarred competence feels lived-in. The final renunciation of fire for light is earned through tactile struggle, not epiphany. Cost is visible: voiceless endurance replaces molten creation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “precisely playful” nature manifests in tactile choices (tracing the seal, interpreting dreams) and emotional contradictions (fear and curiosity during the storm). Her motivation—to understand why paths choose walkers—is consistent and deepens through micro-choices (heating the seal, inviting chaos). However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from analyst to “architect” feels swift, lacking a tangible misstep or resistance that would ground the cost of transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s frugality is vividly embodied as both armor and lens, driving micro-choices (bartering wages, brushing sand) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—skepticism versus yearning for cosmic meaning—animates every beat without diagnostic label-speak. The mentor’s off-page presence deepens motivation credibly, and her final renunciation of certainty (“I’ll honor it”) feels earned. Only slight abstraction in the “grief etched into numbers” moment slightly distances embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly rendered—her “scheming pacifist” duality and moss-soft heart contrast compellingly with her flint-sharp mind. However, secondary characters (Elara, Kael, etc.) function more as thematic vessels than individuals; their emotional shifts feel declarative rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The final visitor Kael shows the strongest friction, but his resentment-to-acceptance arc leans on dialogue exposition (“This is a trick”) rather than embodied struggle. Lirael’s motivation remains consistent, yet her flawless success across multiple visitors strains credibility without visible cost to her own resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—grounded in craft and curiosity—is consistent and deepens under pressure, culminating in a meaningful renunciation (helping the stranger without personal gain). His interiority is concrete (“hands steady,” “breath caught”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The stranger remains enigmatic but functions effectively as a catalyst; their synchronized labor reveals mutual vulnerability without over-explaining. Minor deduction: the stranger’s emotional shift lacks micro-choices that would fully individualize him.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation—rooted in maternal devotion and professional integrity—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (heating wire, catching the ribbon). Her internal contradiction between feistiness and tenderness manifests in micro-choices, like tucking the ribbon away rather than discarding it. However, Mara exists only in memory; without on-page interaction, relationship-as-crucible can’t fully land. The final endurance feels earned but lacks a live interpersonal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her hunger for cosmic truth clashes with her personal fragility, shown via tactile details (sunburned face, trembling hands) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice feels earned: pressing the cameo into the tree crystallizes her renunciation of institutional validation in favor of lived legacy. The “simply complicated” trait informs her professional competence and emotional vulnerability without over-explanation. One minor slip: the grotto vision risks epiphany-as-revelation but is grounded by immediate sensory return.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in her scholarly pride and desire for transformative knowledge, credibly driving her actions. Her internal conflict—between expertise and ignorance—is embodied through tactile choices (humming a childhood tune, pocketing the orchid) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. The “carefully resourceful” trait manifests in micro-choices like using Old Thalassic charms and leveraging the diary as both guide and key. However, Kael’s limited presence reduces relational crucible depth, and her epiphany about ignorance feels slightly tidy given the high-stakes context.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira and Veyra’s contradictory impulses act simultaneously—Lira’s hope against Veyra’s skepticism—and their fused physiology mirrors internal conflict without diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to sew their name is earned by prior causality (journal, card, ship) and carries visible cost: relinquishing the myth for active remembrance. Voice distinction in dialogue (“blissfully aberrant dream” vs. “unkindled solace”) reinforces individuality within symbiosis. Minor deduction for slightly tidy emotional convergence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to translate chaos into order—is vividly embodied in her tactile engagement with the rope, seal, and door. Her “warmly methodical” trait drives concrete action under pressure, not just labels. Interiority avoids diagnostic phrasing; emotions manifest through physical detail (“tremor in her knees,” “breath visible”). The final act crystallizes her identity as a “weaver of timelines,” an earned reconfiguration rooted in consistent behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation—to restore balance by finding silence within chaos—is consistent, embodied, and intensified through tactile engagement with the ice and stone. Her internal conflict between memory and rupture manifests in concrete sensory detail (“Each fissure held a memory… Now, they were just fractures”), avoiding abstraction. The final renunciation isn’t of noise but of domination by it, earned through sustained focus under duress. Her micro-choices (pressing the stone to the spiral, conjuring the bloom mentally) reveal a hierarchy of values: harmony over control, integration over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—proving coincidences have meaning—is embodied through persistent, costly action (bleeding fingers, storm-night alignment) and retrocognitive insight that drives micro-choices. Her internal contradiction (stubborn hope vs. despair) manifests in tactile struggle rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation—accepting the void remains but finding sufficiency in song—earns Charged Poise with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are channeled through glass, blood, and bone.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “preemptively nostalgic” ache manifests in tactile choices (kneeling on crystal, tracing shadows) rather than abstract musing. Her shift from archivist to participant feels earned through micro-decisions: measuring distorted shadows, scribbling conjectures that become dialogue with place. The final renunciation of passive preservation (“not as a keeper… but as a living part”) carries conceptual cost without melodrama. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory immersion and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her shame over the pavilion fire, tactile connection to the kerosene knot, and chant as emotional armor feel specific and consistent. Her contradiction (fear of failure vs. need to create) drives micro-choices like clutching the knot or kneeling to ignite the lily. The final laugh and steady chant credibly mark earned resilience without tidy resolution. However, the mentor’s absence limits relational pressure, slightly muting the cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her role as chronicler, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“fingers traced the water’s edge,” “cold seeped into her skin”). Her micro-choice to reposition the cicada and later speak indirectly to Kael reveals a hierarchy of values—truth through metaphor over confrontation—with relational cost implied in their suspended argument. However, Kael remains underdeveloped; his shift from tension to softening lacks sufficient on-page pressure or contradiction to feel fully earned, weakening the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s motivation—to collect silences—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her risky ascent. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions manifest through sensory perception (e.g., silence “tasted of honey and old wood”). The loss of the doll catalyzes a credible shift from attachment to openness, foreclosing a path with felt cost. However, her father remains a functional archetype rather than a fully pressured secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“tension in her shoulders,” “breath caught”). Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring insight in the storm glass’s behavior. However, the shift from “teach silence” to “notice silence” lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene—her struggle reads as intellectual rather than emotionally fraught, softening the cost of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s “wisely adventurous” paradox manifests in concrete micro-choices—pressing the mural, asking a question instead of fighting—and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels. Her epiphany feels earned because it arises from tactile interaction with murals and the ruby flake, not abstract reflection. The spectral guardian scene risks over-articulation but is rescued by embodied action (placing the shard). One minor slip: the journals’ quoted line leans slightly toward prompt-like phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict—between isolation and connection—is embodied in trembling hands, breath metaphors, and the tactile memory of scars. Her final choice to reach out feels earned, though Kael’s reaction leans slightly toward convenient forgiveness. The “teach suffocating to breathe” line risks diagnostic abstraction but is grounded by immediate physicality (fingertips brushing shadow). Flaws are consistent and costly: her bridge-burning directly caused the sanctuary’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her pyramid scheme trauma informs her skepticism and “virtuously mischievous” agency without diagnostic self-awareness. Her final choice to turn the bolt feels earned through micro-choices (touching it, reading texts) and prior causality. Dr. Voss functions effectively as secondary pressure, though his manic curiosity verges on archetype. The cost of resilience is legible in her earned stasis: she survives by translating dread into action, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, rising arm hairs, and intuitive grasp of sound as memory feel specific and visceral. Her motivation (uncovering her father’s secret) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of legacy that forecloses dynastic restoration with emotional cost. The final choice—to build something transparent—feels earned by ancestral sacrifice revealed through the gramophone ritual. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies; grief and resolve coexist authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cedric’s motivation evolves credibly from trauma to agency, anchored in embodied reactions (crystallized breath, trembling fingers) and micro-choices (tugging strings, descending stairs). His internal contradiction—desire to capture vs. need to release—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final laugh feels earned, not epiphanic, and his renunciation of control carries visible cost: armor shed, greenhouse destroyed. However, the alchemist’s memory arrives as exposition rather than a struggle Cedric actively processes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—his grief, professional rigor, and flicker of hope are rendered through tactile observation and micro-choices (tracing dust circles, handling the button). His motivation stems from lived trauma (“freed him from the plantation but not from the ache of being unwanted”) and intensifies credibly toward his archival act of reclamation. The final choice—to open a new folder titled *Unknown Histories: The Button*—is an Earned Stasis that forecloses passive resignation with visible emotional cost. However, the “tactfully hopeful” trait leans slightly abstract and isn’t dramatized as a constraining force in action.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in being underestimated and driven by inherited rebellion—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., trusting puddle maps, diving first). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (“breath fogged,” “lungs burning”). The key flaw: Jax lacks depth beyond functional support, but as a secondary pressure source, he suffices. Final renunciation (“indifference kills faster than bullets”) earns Charged Poise with visible cost—the explosion, the dive, the solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—hushing a childhood prophecy—is rooted in visceral memory and embodied through precise physicality (cold brass, burning lungs). His internal conflict between fear and duty manifests in micro-choices: playing harder as the figure advances, focusing on “negative space” under pressure. The final renunciation (“merely postponed it”) reads as Earned Stasis with emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; his struggle stays sensorially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elinor’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly; her micro-choices—nudging the speck, building monuments—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reverence for forgotten knowledge. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels and stays embodied (“calloused hands,” “mossy delight”). The final resolve to seek Lirael feels earned by prior causality, though the emotional shift from skepticism to belief lacks a visible internal struggle or cost beyond mild disruption of routine.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, blurred spectacles, and tactile interaction with tools ground his obsession. His contradictory impulses (fixing clocks vs. embracing uncertainty) act simultaneously in the climax, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of perfection is earned through prior struggle, with visible cost: he accepts brokenness as motion. However, his emotional calibration leans slightly tidy in the epiphany (“Uncertainly certain… wasn’t a contradiction”), bordering on diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied counterweight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his ache, his doubt, his tactile memory of Lira—and his micro-choices (clutching the coin, dropping it into the pit) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over closure, love over logic. His contradiction between alchemical balance and emotional rupture feels lived-in, not theoretical. However, Lira’s appearance lacks reciprocal agency; she functions more as oracle than character, limiting the crucible effect. The final renunciation (“accepting the cracks”) is earned but borders on diagnostic phrasing without sufficient bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her fear that “laughter is not enough” feels earned, not diagnostic. Her micro-choice to extend the crocodile’s tooth demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost: risking emotional exposure for healing. The spectral figure functions as a crucible, forcing Lira to confront her own doubt, but remains an extension of her psyche rather than a fully independent agent. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; motivation intensifies coherently from dream to decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his proprioceptive enhancements, trauma responses, and conflicted yearning for “mathematics of mercy” feel specific and urgent. His micro-choices (pressing forehead to tree, catching the strap, refusing to flinch) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The ash-blonde woman functions as catalyst, not equal partner, keeping focus on Elias’s renunciation-as-endurance. However, his final shift toward hope borders on unearned without clearer causal buildup from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath mirroring waves, scars aligning with stars—and her micro-choices (drinking the ink, pressing her palm) reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, though the final renunciation lacks explicit cost beyond emotional weight. The weaver functions as catalyst, not crucible, limiting relational depth. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—ghosts as unacknowledged grief—is compelling and consistent, and his observational skill drives key actions. However, his emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior internal contradiction; the cost of understanding is felt but not deeply embodied in a renunciation or irreversible choice. The clown ghost’s appearance risks tipping into sentimentality, though her whisper avoids overt moralizing. His character remains specific, yet the resolution softens the weight of his burden rather than crystallizing a charged poise with sharper stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—compressing eternity to rupture order—is consistent, embodied, and escalates credibly to her climactic choice. Her internal conflict (duty vs. rebellion) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation carries visible cost: her press falls silent, her role ends. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—reimagining a civilization through suppressed fragments—is vividly embodied in his actions (draping mirrors, planting fungi) and internalized through poetic sorrow. His revolutionary past informs present restraint, creating credible tension between firebrand history and archaeologist’s patience. The shard functions as both object and emotional anchor, revealing contradictory impulses: desire for truth versus fear of futility. Final renunciation isn’t victory but endurance, with cost legible in his isolation and the Council’s condemnation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s emotional arc is embodied and specific—her clenched hands, fogged breath, and crumpling face dramatize regret without therapy-speak. Elias’s quiet competence and moral clarity feel earned through micro-choices (e.g., selecting starlight thread only after truth is spoken). The husband’s off-page dishonesty functions as a credible blind spot that compounds before resolution. Final renunciation (“admit what was taken”) carries visible cost: confronting betrayal to reclaim light.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation as a “petrichor collector” is vividly embodied and consistent, driving her into the cliffs with credible curiosity. Her internal contradiction—seeking answers yet embracing mystery—is rendered through tactile choices (opening jars, touching rock) rather than exposition. The psychometry skill feels earned by prior behavior, not tacked on. However, her emotional shift at the lagoon lacks micro-beats of resistance or doubt, slightly flattening the climax’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly embodied through her sculptures and micro-choices, especially when she presses the lantern slide to the keystone—a decisive act rooted in her desire to “scaffold complexity with simplicity.” Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception (“turbine-hum reverie,” “salt and iron”). However, the grandmother figure appears too briefly to fully test relational dynamics or status shifts, limiting the depth of interpersonal pressure. The final reconfiguration feels earned but leans slightly on inherited lore rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling brush, coiled restlessness, and tactile engagement with glass reveal contradiction without diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (painting shadows, not jasmine; climbing scaffolding at night) align with a hierarchy of values rooted in grief and curiosity. Sister Agatha functions as pressure, not foil, and their sparse dialogue sharpens Mara’s resolve without resolving her quest. The final renunciation (“I’ve only just begun to reckon”) forecloses closure while honoring cost: years of obsession, unanswered questions, and the burden of inherited mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, fraying identity under retrocognitive strain—and her contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously during the lagoon parley. Her final choice to descend feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in lost identity and blanked diary. Elara’s ghost functions as crucible without over-explaining, and Joran applies immediate pressure relevant to stakes. Minor deduction: the antagonist’s late reveal lacks sufficient groundwork in Mara’s earlier knowledge state.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to reimagine a dead civilization through memory—is compelling and consistent, rooted in his alchemical past and hollowed-out present. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied in trembling hands, gaunt reflection, and tactile engagement with artifacts. The rejection of false comfort manifests credibly in his refusal to surrender to the bottle’s impossibility. Final renunciation isn’t needed because his endurance *is* the action—rebuilding through recall—and the cost (isolation, futility overcome by will) is felt without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elder Voss’s motivation—to archive emotional imprints—is deeply woven into his actions and perception, and his final renunciation (“not to stop the storm, but to listen”) is earned through decades of practice and this night’s revelation. His interiority is concrete: calloused hands, trembling fingers, bone-deep resonance with sound. The contradiction between preservation and surrender sharpens in the climax without therapy-speak. His use of Old High Martian feels embodied, not ornamental, and his epiphany arises from sensory immersion, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s “furiously tranquil” contradiction is embodied in precise action under pressure, not merely labeled. Her motivation—to discover the texture of borrowed time—is woven into micro-choices (offering seeds, pressing palm to acorn cap) that carry visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotions are rendered through tactile, sensory detail (“gritty like sand… smooth like water”). The final laugh feels earned by prior causality and reflects credible endurance with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—curiosity tempered by humility—drives credible micro-choices: testing the bell, switching ropes, then modulating rhythm to soothe storms. Her internal contradiction (desire to act vs. need to listen) manifests physically and sonically. Elder Veyra applies immediate pressure that crystallizes Lira’s growth without overshadowing her agency. The final renunciation of noise for listening feels earned, though the emotional cost remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zara’s motivation is rooted in consistent, embodied traits—her calloused hands, spiritually curious mind, and ritualistic use of the lantern—and her final choice (to “listen” rather than report) earns closure through renunciation with visible cost: she forgoes institutional validation for personal truth. Her internal contradiction (grief vs. wonder) acts simultaneously in scene, especially when kneeling at the crater. However, Veyra’s shift feels slightly under-earned; his softened reaction lacks a micro-choice that visibly alters their dynamic beyond a glance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve unspoken words—is clear and consistent, driving his daily ritual with the box. His interiority is rendered through concrete perception (“gaze fixed on intricate patterns”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, his transformation from silent preservation to speech lacks micro-choices that dramatize internal contradiction; the shift feels more epiphanic than earned through layered struggle. The final act of speaking carries emotional weight but emerges from ghostly prompting rather than a fully embodied crisis of will.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his grief, obsession with time, and tactile rituals (cufflinks, urn fragment) feel specific and lived-in. His motivation intensifies credibly from abstract loss to active reclamation of meaning. The urn fragment’s weight and the word “suddenly” trigger a visceral memory, not an epiphany. However, his transformation lacks a clear micro-choice under pressure; the shift feels more perceptual than decisional, slightly undercutting the cost of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in tactile perception (“fingers warmly attentive to the feather’s texture”) and philosophical conviction. Her micro-choices—gathering storm debris, weaving kelp, humming—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on tending fracture. The fisherman’s silent nod functions as external validation without diluting her solitude. However, her flaw lacks tangible consequence; her worldview faces no real threat, softening the cost of her “Earned Stasis.”

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and consistent: her “brazen calm” manifests in micro-choices (e.g., pausing to sip water amid spiritual tremors) and contradictions (urgency vs. patience). Her terminal diagnosis fuels credible endurance, not heroics, and her final renunciation—choosing the island over escape—is earned through prior causality. The spirit interaction reveals relational stakes without melodrama, and her flaw (stubborn idealism) compounds pressure without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s skepticism and obsession feel earned through embodied contradictions—clutching the amber while dissecting its myth—and her final laugh carries the weight of surrendered certainty. Kael functions effectively as a pressure source, though her backstory remains thin by design. The micro-choice to place the amber in the sculpture’s hands crystallizes Lirael’s shift without over-explaining. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory disorientation (“skepticism unravel like a frayed rope”) over therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman’s motivation—transforming battlefield into garden—is deeply rooted in trauma and hope, with credible endurance over resolution. His past as a soldier and present ritualistic actions reveal a hierarchy of values (life over violence) with visible cost: time, solitude, and emotional labor. Internal contradiction surfaces subtly: belief in renewal vs. awareness of decay. However, his emotional state remains slightly too coherent under pressure; a sharper moment of doubt or bodily fatigue would heighten authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hush’s motivation—to translate distance into closeness—is consistent and embodied through her sensory engagement with the cylinders and leaf. Her “intuitively descriptive” trait drives action, though it leans slightly abstract without more internal contradiction or struggle. Jeb functions effectively as a secondary pressure point, but their dynamic lacks deeper friction or status shifts. The final bark feels earned, yet the emotional cost of her wartime past remains underexplored beyond summary.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elio’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his exile is both punishment and sanctuary, his confusion both burden and compass. His micro-choices (sketching, clutching the compass, choosing a path) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in inherited curiosity and ethical resistance. The grandmother apparition avoids sentimentality by serving as a catalyst for earned insight, not exposition. His final decision feels inevitable yet costly: freedom demands surrender to uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation as a “chivalrous thief” and “apprentice of wonder” is vividly embodied through tactile choices—swapping pawns filled with liquid starlight, bishops holding primal light—and his internal stance aligns with action under pressure. His emotional state remains grounded in physical sensation (fogged breath, trembling walls) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the absence of true internal contradiction or struggle beyond procedural caution limits the depth of his characterization. The final reconfiguration feels earned but leans more on concept than psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, pacing, and emotional weight feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her contradiction (mimicking grief while forgetting her truth) operates continuously in-scene. The final realization that she *is* the pawn emerges organically from prior micro-choices (walking, reversing the pattern). Cost is visible: her scars ache as she unbinds herself—a quiet but legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s motivation—to understand the shape of home—is compellingly rooted in embodied grief and contradiction: she avoids the stone yet seeks it, dreads memory yet needs it. Her final choice to embrace others’ memories as her truth is earned through micro-choices (pressing the feather, whispering “I want to remember”) and carries visible cost (obsidian shards in her skin). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using concrete sensory detail (“mercury skin flared,” “fingers tracing the stone’s cold surface”). The only flaw: Orin’s presence feels functional rather than fully pressurizing.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alaric’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, fidgeting ring, and guilt-laced memory feel specific and contradictory. His motivation (self-forgiveness) intensifies credibly through micro-choices like plucking the black thread. The final renunciation of perfectionism (“mistakes were moves, not endings”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the transition from paralyzing guilt to serene acceptance lacks a beat of tangible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is vividly rooted in his belief that truth must be refracted, not owned, and his defiance feels earned through consistent micro-choices (e.g., smuggling nightshade ink, painting “Forgive”). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels—emotions are embodied in actions like climbing bone towers and reciting raw verse. The old woman elder applies immediate, legible pressure, and Kael’s “innocently mischievous” trait manifests in dialogue with clear cost: disruption of the ritual and implied future exile. However, his epiphany about forgiveness as courage to release control borders on slightly over-articulated insight without enough prior struggle to fully earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s uncertainty is embodied in trembling hands, muffled speech, and flawed recall—never abstracted. Her arc from avoidance to acceptance feels earned through micro-choices (removing respirator, pressing charm harder). Interior contradiction pulses throughout: she seeks certainty yet clings to fragments. Final renunciation (“the charm is a promise”) crystallizes her growth with visible cost—burning lungs, surrender to acid fumes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in grief, nostalgia, and a hidden promise—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. His interiority is concrete (“fingers smudged with salt and pigment,” “intuitively humming”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The painted shell anchors his emotional arc, and his final act of drawing the cavern reveals a credible, earned shift from observation to creation. The cost—decades of emotional weight lifted—is felt without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—proving whispers outlast shouts—is rooted in specific familial trauma and embodied through micro-choices (stealing the vial, humming with intent). Her internal contradiction (fear vs. longing) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Thalos avoids stereotype by sharing her belief system, deepening their dynamic without over-explaining. The final renunciation of silence-as-isolation is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost visible in tears and trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation—to navigate the geography of loss—is embodied in tactile, specific choices: using her hair in the antenna, tracing etchings, responding to weight shifts. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through action (“tears streaking her dirt-smudged cheeks”) and contradiction (determination shadowed by grief). The grandmother’s voice functions as memory-pressure, not deus ex machina, because it echoes established ritual. Final renunciation isn’t needed—her endurance *is* the navigation, foreclosing isolation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—cultivating psychological safety—is consistent and embodied through her truffle trade, note-taking, and cautious use of the glass eye. Her internal conflict between rational skepticism and pragmatic belief in the eye’s power is subtly rendered without therapy-speak. Jorn’s paranoia feels earned by the world’s rules, and their interaction reveals status shifts through gesture and speech. However, Mara’s final choice lacks a visible cost beyond implied risk, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his obsession with “borrowed memories” stems from personal loss, embodied in tactile details like the brittle Edelweiss and his habit of humming hymns to waves. His final choice to return the memories feels earned, foreclosing his own isolation with visible emotional cost. The woman’s hollow eyes and rasped dialogue reveal her trauma without exposition, and their status dynamic (keeper vs. mourner) subtly shifts as trust forms. However, her backstory arrives largely through summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, slightly weakening reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her loneliness, grief, and yearning for agency pulse through tactile details (glasses, brittle map, humming chip). Her motivation intensifies credibly from skepticism to resolve, and her final choice (“not lost… following the ants”) reconfigures her past without tidy resolution. The vision of her father avoids diagnostic self-awareness, grounding epiphany in sensory memory. Minor deduction: the printer’s exposition slightly flattens Lila’s initial stakes, though her actions quickly reclaim agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s interior conflict—between numbness and fear—is embodied through tactile details (sweat-damp sheets, iron taste) and micro-choices (climbing despite dread). Her final retreat feels earned, not passive, as it crystallizes her refusal to confront vulnerability. However, the seer’s “softly commanding” trait is mentioned but never enacted, slightly weakening motivation anchoring. The figure’s diagnostic clarity (“you are afraid”) borders on label-speak but is offset by visceral setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her “scientifically romantic” worldview, and her internal conflict—forcing vs. listening to the shell—is dramatized through micro-choices (e.g., placing the shell atop the engine). Jorin functions as both mirror and pressure, his dialogue revealing relational stakes without melodrama. The final renunciation of control (“letting it guide”) feels earned by prior failures. However, Jorin’s interiority remains underdeveloped, limiting full crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly contradictory—simultaneously jealous of and repulsed by his past selves—and his micro-choices (climbing the ledge, handling the scroll) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in chronicling and self-reckoning. The “chronologically confused” trait informs his perception without becoming diagnostic label-speak. His final renunciation of jealousy feels earned through embodied struggle rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in the scroll’s phrasing (“bones to lead”), which edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her phantom scent, tactile reading of objects, and emotional calibration feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (cleaning the screw, comparing it to the mainspring, writing the note) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she trades closure for herself to gift it to Mrs. Voss. The only flaw is slight over-articulation in the final realization (“ordinary miracle”), which borders on diagnostic label-speak but is redeemed by its grounding in the screw’s engraving and photo.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—transforming scars into stories—is embodied in trembling hands, ink-stained fingers, and micro-choices like carving runes despite fear. His internal conflict (doubt vs. courage) operates simultaneously, not sequentially, and his flaws directly shape the climax. The mentor’s absence is felt through memory without diluting single-POV focus. Final renunciation of hesitation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: scars reshaped, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara and Elias are vividly drawn through embodied contradictions—Clara’s performative cynicism masking emotional intuition, Elias’s guilt manifesting as creative paralysis. Their micro-choices (Clara unscrewing the bottle, Elias resuming the sonata) reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. The sister’s voice emerges not as a ghost but as resonance, making the final act feel psychologically earned. However, Lila’s characterization remains spectral rather than individuated, slightly weakening the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Witness’s motivation is clear and consistent, but their interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing (“weight of a thousand lifetimes,” “chaos within”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final realization feels earned thematically but lacks concrete behavioral stakes or visible cost beyond metaphorical peace. Emotional progression remains cerebral rather than visceral, with minimal irrationality or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lorn’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile relationship with the key, his ritual counting, and his grandfather’s aphorisms reveal a mind shaped by inherited mystery and quiet obsession. His contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. caution, routine vs. revelation) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final realization about “longing” emerges credibly from his sensory and emotional journey. His flaws (fixation, isolation) deepen stakes without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s internal contradiction—between control and surrender—is embodied through tactile choices (laser frequency adjustments, hesitation at the barrier) rather than abstract musing. His “spatially gifted” trait manifests in perception that directly enables plot turns, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Lira functions as a crucible: her challenge forces Kael’s renunciation of analytical dominance, and their shared history adds weight without exposition. The final nod carries cost—abandoning his transient professional identity—and feels earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s compulsive gambling and intellectual inheritance manifest as embodied contradiction—her fingers trace chalk while her mind parses probability, and her final choice to visit her father emerges from layered internal pressure, not epiphany. Ms. Greer applies immediate, relevant pressure that crystallizes Clara’s arc without overshadowing her agency. The only slight flaw: the father’s absence leans slightly on summary rather than dramatized memory during high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her belief in “cultivated estrangement” manifests through micro-choices like spinning the disc to modulate caller emotions. Her actions align with a quiet, principled competence, and her emotional progression feels earned, not diagnostic. However, secondary characters (Elise, David) remain lightly sketched; their roles serve Mara’s arc but lack reciprocal pressure or status dynamics that would deepen relational stakes. The final renunciation—continuing alone—is credible but carries minimal visible cost beyond implied solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile rituals, emotional contradictions (dread/thrill), and micro-choices (painting the locket, tucking it away) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to preserve through attention, not sacrifice—is consistent and deepened by ancestral legacy. The final renunciation of grand gestures in favor of “small moments” is earned by her prior actions and reflections. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s desperation and jocularity feel embodied (“boots squelched,” “joke itched in his throat”), and his arc from shielded cynic to someone whose laughter becomes “a bridge” is earned through micro-choices (swallowing the joke, stepping forward with the rock). Lira’s sharpness and botanical obsession are distinct but serve primarily as catalysts; her interiority remains thin. The ghost’s revelation reframes Elias’s motivation without over-explaining, preserving moral ambiguity. However, the conductor’s static-face metaphor slightly flattens what should be a climactic emotional confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his blindness, grief, and tactile perception shape every micro-choice. His motivation (to map emotional depths via his mother’s lullaby) intensifies credibly under pressure. The final encounter with his mother as “memory made flesh” avoids sentimentality by grounding emotion in sensory vibration. Flawless integration of trait, trauma, and action earns this near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, professional identity, and internal contradiction (“confidently uncertain”) are concretely embodied through micro-choices (apologizing, listening) and sensory reactions to the anomaly. Lira functions effectively as a crucible, not a plot device—her presence forces Elias to confront his flawed methodology. The final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality: his blight-causing edit directly motivates his shift from fixer to guide. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels humanly irrational yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his belief that “silence held more truth than words” drives his actions and culminates in a meaningful endurance (Earned Stasis) when he accepts the transience of the night’s joy. His micro-choices, like signing slowly for Lira or touching the camera to his heart, reveal hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. However, Lira remains underdeveloped beyond her function as witness; her trembling hands signal emotion but lack contradictory impulses or independent stakes. The fisherman’s request feels reactive rather than pressurizing, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her grandmother’s legacy and embodied through tactile, emotionally charged actions—brushstrokes, ink recipes, tears. Her internal conflict between destruction and preservation manifests not as abstract dilemma but as volcanic tenderness made concrete in every vandalized canvas. The final revelation that the healed portrait is her grandmother’s delivers earned emotional payoff without sentimentality. Flawless interiority under pressure, with micro-choices (painting symbols, adding a tear) revealing a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motivation—rooted in bodily trauma and a borrowed sorrow—is compellingly embodied through scars, drumming, and tactile interaction with the garden. His quiet rebellion manifests in micro-choices (climbing, drumming) that escalate meaningfully. The arrival of the second character sharpens his arc without overshadowing his interiority. However, the shift from “his” to “my” POV mid-story introduces disorienting slippage that momentarily fractures consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to prove whispers travel farther than shouts—is embodied in micro-choices (humming instead of answering, trusting silence over maps) and deepened by his relationship to the zodiac coin and labyrinth. His internal contradiction (reliance on map vs. instinct) resolves credibly through action, not epiphany. The final renunciation—choosing not to answer the hauler—carries visible cost: isolation, yet mastery. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (trembling hands, ozone taste), consistent under storm stress.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation and interiority are vividly embodied through tactile ritual and sensory perception, not exposition. Her silence reads as active choice, not passivity, and her micro-decisions—tilting shutters, angling the mirror—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on nonverbal communion. The dental mirror functions as both heirloom and instrument, grounding her emotional inheritance in physical action. However, the lack of internal contradiction or struggle slightly limits depth; her “spiraling calm” remains untested by genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara and Lila’s interiority is embodied and specific—Clara’s grief-driven rebellion, Lila’s silent yearning—and their micro-choices (e.g., Lila gripping the pawn, Clara revealing her father’s past) reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. The unspoken-word trait avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding it in sensory detail (“vibrated louder”) and emotional consequence. Their relationship functions as a crucible: each move deepens trust while foreclosing isolation. Flaws are consistent—Clara’s guardedness, Lila’s fear of abandonment—and drive credible endurance rather than tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her coiled muscles, laughter through tears—but her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“the island hadn’t been a prison but a mirror”) rather than fully earned contradiction. Her motivation intensifies credibly from survival to self-liberation, and the scrimshaw choice carries visible cost. However, the emotional shift at climax lacks friction; she moves from trauma to serene freedom without residual struggle, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her grief manifests through tactile rituals (whittling, crumbling petals) rather than diagnostic labels. Her moral ambiguity (“rebellion against the mandate, yet a surrender to its demands”) is credibly sustained, and her final resolve feels earned through micro-choices (carving spoons as defiance). However, her emotional flatness borders on gestural poverty in places, limiting full contradiction-in-action. The father/mother backstory anchors motivation but risks summary over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lirael’s motivation—craving dissolution of boundaries after years of isolation—is vividly embodied and intensifies credibly. Her aesthetic drive informs perception (“reading a language written in frost”) and action (paraphrasing the world), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see desire but not competing urges under pressure. The final step onto water feels earned by buildup but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his colorblindness reframes perception rather than limits it, and his micro-choices (accepting Marla’s trade, pressing the reed tongue) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on imperfection. His flaw (swearing off pigment) directly fuels his arc, and his final act—painting with cobalt—carries visible cost: relinquishing his old aesthetic for uncertain revelation. Marla’s motivation (“sideways is where the magic lives”) feels earned through her backstory shard in the mural. Only slight over-articulation in “hauntingly empty” edges toward label-speak, but it’s swiftly countered by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly embodied—her tactile yearning for the “texture of connection” drives micro-choices like pressing the lens to carvings or hesitating at the cave entrance. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through sensory perception (“skin prickled,” “fingers danced”). The “powerfully gentle” trait shapes her actions without over-explanation. However, Dr. Voss remains a functional foil rather than a fully pressured secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—atonement through mending—is vividly embodied in his bleeding fingers, origami folds, and lantern-lighting ritual. His internal contradiction (grief vs. ardor) pulses in concrete choices, not therapy-speak. The final renunciation of despair is earned by prior causality: his hands grow steady only after projecting the curtains. Cost is legible in his hollowed selfhood and the wife’s lost dreams woven into cranes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her steady curiosity manifests in dismantling clocks and measuring emotional distances, not as labels but as lived tactics. Her micro-choices (measuring the space to Mara, laying cards where raindrops fall) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: trading data analysis for cartomancy, surrendering certainty for pattern-mapping. Mara’s presence functions as crucible without flattening either character; their dialogue carries distinct idiom (Mara’s frayed urgency vs. Elara’s precise calm). The only slight gap: Elara’s shift from analyst to mystic lacks a single dramatized pivot, though backstory is tightly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation—pursuit of forbidden knowledge through chaos-as-purity—is consistent and embodied in micro-choices (touching the pagoda, rejecting Kael’s fear). Her internal conflict between hunger for truth and awareness of its danger manifests physically (“tremor in her hands”) and philosophically without diagnostic self-awareness. Kael functions effectively as secondary pressure, his fear contrasting her resolve, though his abrupt exit slightly undercuts relational stakes. The final renunciation of nostalgia-as-burden feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s softly deliberate nature manifests in micro-choices—comparing archival footage alone, hesitating before speaking the word “Bloom”—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority is concrete (“sharp eyes tracing the dusk,” “mind raced”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The blurred 1987 figure creates credible internal contradiction: is she repeating history or forging anew? Her final act earns closure through prior causality, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, whispered reassurance to a relic, and tactile engagement with tools reveal a psyche under pressure without resorting to diagnostic labels. Her contradiction (gentleness vs. self-preservation) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The shedding metaphor aligns with her micro-choices, and her final renunciation of guilt feels earned. Only minor over-articulation in “fragility felt less like a flaw and more like a language” slightly distances the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to read the language of scars—is embodied through tactile interaction with memory and environment, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Her internal contradiction (seeking closure yet reopening trauma) drives micro-choices like touching the hourglass or following coffee rings. The scar functions as both wound and compass, grounding her emotional arc in physical sensation. However, the telepathic plant trait borders on label-only, slightly weakening interior consistency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—to find “where unused love is stored”—is vividly embodied through tactile interaction with the film strip and crystal, revealing interior contradiction between longing and fear of inherited grief. Her spatial imagination isn’t just stated; it drives micro-choices (rewinding, pressing palm to celluloid) that escalate pressure. Emotional progression avoids tidy resolution—she doesn’t “fix” Elise’s pain but commits to witnessing it. The final whisper (“I’ll find you”) crystallizes her renunciation of passive inheritance in favor of active stewardship, with clear cost: she now carries generations of unresolved love.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—freeing trapped creativity through celestial listening—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving his actions with emotional specificity. His internal conflict between yearning and doubt manifests in tactile choices (e.g., tracing stardust, spilling the jar). However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle; the “unspoken words” arrive more as revelation than earned insight. The grandmother’s sextant and astronomer’s legacy ground his backstory, but the emotional shift at climax borders on diagnostic (“Creativity isn’t trapped. It’s waiting”) rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his dreamlessness defines his observational role, and his micro-choice to twist the clock hands emerges credibly from accumulated longing. The woman’s flickering presence pressures his self-concept without over-explaining. His emotional shift (“chest ached”) avoids therapy-speak and grounds his transformation in bodily sensation. However, his final dream lacks contradictory impulses; the epiphany feels slightly too seamless for a character defined by absence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rediscovering the “wild frontier of her mind”—is vividly embodied through tactile habits (worn gear), sensory perception (wind tones), and micro-choices (planting the gear). Her internal conflict between machine logic and primordial chaos is consistent, though the father’s holographic appearance risks tipping into diagnostic exposition (“you’ve found the hum”). The final renunciation feels earned, with clear cost: an empty pocket but a full mind.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira and Jorin embody clear, consistent motivations rooted in generational duty and nascent courage. Their interiority is filtered through tactile detail—Jorin’s fidgeting hem, Lira’s steady hands—and their growth feels earned, not declared. The “gently persistent” trait appears organically in both dialogue and action, though Jorin’s arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in breath, gravel, and starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elric’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his silence as both duty and flaw—and his micro-choices (e.g., pocketing the bolt, tracing the stain) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His final speech feels earned, not diagnostic, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulation over visceral struggle. Lady Veyra functions effectively as immediate pressure, but her transformation lacks reciprocal depth. The child at the end crystallizes Elric’s shift without undermining his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veyra’s motivation is vividly rooted in legacy and truth, with embodied emotion (“star trapped in her chest”) and micro-choices (interpreting ancestral messages) that reveal hierarchy of values. Her “regally unpretentious” demeanor manifests in action—quiet command over spectacle. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; she moves with near-flawless competence, lacking struggle that would deepen credibility. Final renunciation of vengeance for revelation feels earned but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—driven by grief, scientific rigor, and a tactile language of rhythm—is consistent and embodied. Her tapping practice reveals interior contradiction: she seeks order amid dissolution. Kael functions credibly as secondary pressure, his skepticism forcing Lira’s resolve to crystallize. However, the final choice to follow the plankton path lacks micro-hesitation or cost articulation beyond abstract “defiance,” slightly undercutting full Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s “awkward confidence” is embodied through micro-choices—kneeling at the stones, handing Jax the glasses—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are tactile (“hum pulsing in her veins”) and contradictory (defiant yet vulnerable). The trait drives action rather than decorates it, though Jax’s shift from skeptic to ally feels slightly under-pressured for full 9+ causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nana Marisol’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, blistered knuckles, and insurgent past ground her motivation. Her contradiction between reverence for tradition and desire to evolve it fuels credible choices under pressure. The telepathy with plants feels earned, not gimmicky, and her final act carries visible cost: risking ridicule (“They might call her mad”) to nurture a new future. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile action and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s trauma and resilience are rendered through embodied choices—her trembling hands, the tactile use of lavender and stone—not diagnostic labels. Her final micro-choice to walk home with steady steps feels earned by prior somatic practice. Mrs. Voss serves as pressure, not exposition, and their dynamic subtly shifts status through shared silence rather than overt dialogue. The only flaw: Elias exists solely as memory, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“ribs ache,” “fingers over the half-finished portrait”) and consistent contradictions—he scorns tarot yet obsesses over its fragments, despises incompleteness yet paints ghosts. His micro-choices (tipping the box, tearing the Hanged Man card) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over polish, reassembly over abandonment. The final act of weaving threads into art feels earned, though the shift from despair to agency lacks one more beat of friction to fully crystallize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in her brother’s disappearance, and her actions—deciphering the drone, interpreting ephemeral ink—align with a coherent internal logic. Her “serene anger” is embodied through controlled gestures rather than exposition. The child interaction reveals subtle shifts in understanding without overstatement. However, the brother’s absence remains abstract; his emotional weight relies on assertion more than dramatized memory or specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lirael’s motivation is clear and rooted in her role as archivist, but her internal conflict leans on summary (“bravely conflicted heart”) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. Her decisive action—awakening Kael—is credible but lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final pact with Kael feels emotionally tidy, avoiding the irrationality or hypocrisy that would deepen realism.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s pacifism, tactile relationship with silence, and redefinition of her father’s knife reveal a coherent interiority shaped by embodied contradiction—tending life while surrounded by relics of violence. Her micro-choices (planting the scrap, humming during labor) reflect a hierarchy of values with visible cost: calloused hands instead of combat scars. The backstory is tightly anchored to present stimuli (the sandbag, the dome) and tilts her stance via actionable decisions. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion emerges through soil, thorns, and refracted light.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s cool-headedness is embodied through precise actions and micro-choices—striking the spike, adjusting the emitter—under mounting emotional pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief and hope register via physical sensation (“surge of emotion,” “shoulders slumping”). The final renunciation—accepting the goddess’s dissolution as necessary—is earned by his prior mastery of “voicing silence.” However, his motivation lacks friction; he never wavers or questions the cost until it’s already paid.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotion (“the metal bit into her palm”) and micro-choices (handing over the nib) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation intensifies credibly from doubt to action, and her final endurance—facing familial fallout while testifying—shows earned stasis with visible cost. The only slight flaw is the near-instantaneous pivot from discovery to full dossier assembly, which compresses struggle without dramatizing tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—rooted in maternal silence and guilt—is embodied through tactile memory (“mother’s sobs muffled by a lullaby”) and crystallizes in her climactic choice to voice the letter aloud. Her internal conflict (escape vs. confrontation) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final act of reading the letter is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, Dr. Marlow remains under-pressurized; her role leans expository rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s socially perceptive trait and chalk-artist identity cohere with her actions, especially her intuitive decoding of the grotto’s patterns. Her internal conflict—between preserving silence and “interjecting”—is embodied through micro-choices (drawing the mandala, pressing the tile) rather than abstract reflection. The mantra “unlearning isn’t forgetting” feels earned through tactile engagement, not diagnostic label-speak. However, her shift from unease to determination lacks a visible cost or irreversible renunciation, softening the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his retrocognition, tactile engagement with the tessera, and mantra of “aberrant mercy” reveal a coherent, conflicted psyche. His micro-choice to place the tile enacts his paradoxical creed without over-explaining. However, his flaw (“retrocognitively trapped”) functions more as atmospheric texture than a driver of concrete error or trade-off under pressure. The final resolve feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond abstract resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his encore-seeking nature and synesthetic perception, driving concrete choices like humming the melody to produce echoes. His internal contradiction—longing for audience validation while existing beyond time—is embodied through sensory-rich actions rather than exposition. The flapper woman’s arrival tests his hope against past failure, deepening his arc without tidy resolution. Final renunciation (fading at dawn) carries visible cost: he mends the timeline but cannot stay, underscoring earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his skepticism, grief, and scientific curiosity intertwine without diagnostic abstraction. His micro-choices (rejecting the recall, using the geode as a compass) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: isolation from corporate “solutions,” reliance on fragile somatic markers. Mara’s presence sharpens his stance without flattening her into a foil; their dynamic feels lived-in, not instrumental. The final renunciation of pills in favor of self-guided awareness reads as earned endurance, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with the fossil, algae, and mapper reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in sensory curiosity and stewardship. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through physical communion with the spores. The final resolve feels earned by her prior micro-choices (activating tools, touching the fossil), though the shift from cartographer to “translator” leans slightly toward abstraction without a concrete renunciation of her former self.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as an hourglass turner, and her quiet inspiration manifests through tactile engagement with buttons and the jar. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and instead emerges through embodied choices—kneeling, sorting, listening—that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of fixed prophecy, embracing malleability with felt cost: time trickles, silence deepens, and history weighs. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the edge of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“gloved hands gripping the cold iron,” “breath visible in the cold”) and contradictory impulses—her paranoia versus her need to trust, her fear versus her resolve. Her motivation stems from a concrete, personal wound (her father’s disappearance) and intensifies credibly through memory and symbol. The final choice—to transcribe the code into the earth, accepting impermanence—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. However, the epiphany about “unused courage” leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity rather than messy, mid-crisis irrationality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thaddeus’s motivation—to distill complexity into essence—is embodied through the yarn needle and his ambient awareness, creating a coherent interiority. His “closely attentive” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., sensing the ferryman’s presence through boat vibrations) that reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; instead, he exhibits serene consistency bordering on passivity. The absence of genuine struggle or blind spots prevents full 9+ eligibility despite strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her zen potter identity manifests in tactile observation and quiet resolve. Her motivation (understanding entropy resistance) intensifies organically into a vision-driven revelation. The backstory of her younger self planting sunflowers as “a prayer” retroactively deepens her present arc without over-explaining. However, the emotional shift from observer to inheritor of memory lacks micro-choices under pressure; she receives insight rather than earns it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—“to reflect light into dark corners”—is embodied through micro-choices (leaving geraniums, tapping the gauge) that reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost. His “wistfully pragmatic” worldview manifests in actions, not labels, and his internal contradiction (hope vs. weariness) pulses beneath every gesture. Mara’s cautious thaw feels earned because her resistance is rooted in specific grief, not abstraction. The final brush of fingers and opened window crystallize relational change without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation—to translate isolation into independence—is clear, consistent, and embodied in micro-choices (e.g., touching the sundial, speaking aloud, placing her palm on its surface). Her internal conflict between connection to ancestral ghosts and self-definition is rendered through sensory detail and action rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation (“I am not you”) feels earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No second character appears, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; single-POV interiority remains focused and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., trembling hand when writing her secret), and her flaw—helping others hide truths while hollowing herself—is credibly dramatized. However, her final shift toward encouraging clients to speak aloud feels slightly declarative rather than fully earned by on-page causality; the transformation leans on Elara’s exposition more than Lila’s own struggle. The grandmother memory provides strong anchoring, but the emotional pivot lacks a decisive internal contradiction in-scene. Still, her motivation remains consistent and rooted in a relatable fear of disconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her cautious hope, trembling hands, and quiet resolve reveal a nuanced hierarchy of values under pressure. Her micro-choices (uploading code, refusing to flinch at the voice) align with her role and history without over-explanation. Professor Hale serves as effective secondary pressure, his skepticism and trust sharpening Lila’s isolation and resolve. The only slight flaw: the final whisper (“Then I’ll dam it”) edges toward declarative neatness rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature create authentic internal conflict that directly informs his choices—especially his final lunge. His embodied reactions (shallow breath, rib-clawing panic) feel specific and urgent, not diagnostic. The compass and key interactions reveal character through action, though the resolution leans slightly tidy given the depth of his fear. His endurance feels earned, with visible cost in tension and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s face blindness informs her method and emotional depth without veering into diagnostic exposition; her micro-choices—tracing the ribbon, sketching with Voss—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on empathy over procedure. Voss is economically rendered but functions credibly as pressure and foil. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of numbness, earned through tactile collaboration. No safety-hedging: her flaw (inability to recognize faces) becomes her forensic strength.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation—driven by ancestral legacy and truth-seeking—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers traced the edges of ancient charts,” “hands trembled”), and her final act embodies a credible endurance with felt cost. The “nervously confident” trait manifests in micro-choices (interrupting the director, reading aloud on the roof), though internal contradiction could be sharper. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing mars her emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to reconstruct Marisol’s mystery and “sculpt possibility”—is rooted in his identity as a bridge-song fiddler, and his dynamically observant nature informs micro-choices like noticing pixel shifts. However, the final decision to play again lacks internal friction; his leap into belief feels swift, with minimal contradictory impulse dramatized under pressure. The cost of this choice remains conceptual rather than embodied, weakening emotional stakes. Interiority is vivid but leans toward poetic abstraction over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between inherited criminality and chosen restraint—is rendered with specificity, especially in his tactile handling of the foreign bills and his aversion to confrontation. His “polished calm” is embodied through action (leaving symbolic notes) rather than stated as a trait. However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy: the transition from restless heir to serene renouncer lacks friction or irrational contradiction under pressure. The father’s influence feels thematic more than causally active in Elias’s final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s motivation—decoding the temple to find her vanished brother—is clear, consistent, and deepened by personal history. Her internal conflict between chronicler detachment and empathic engagement manifests physically (pen hovering, throat tightening) and culminates in a credible, costly choice: surrendering emotional distance to “carry others’ weights.” The final lullaby etched in her brother’s handwriting earns its emotional payoff through embodied grief rather than abstraction. Minor deduction for slightly tidy resolution of her fear-of-drowning-in-others’-pain, though the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s guarded nature and internal conflict are vividly embodied—bark-rough hands, storm-cloud eyes, thorn-walled heart—and her guilt-driven motivation intensifies credibly under pressure. The vision of her past violence reveals contradictory impulses (self-defense vs. shame) without diagnostic label-speak. Her final choice to accept darkness as part of strength feels earned by prior causality, with the cost legible in her lightened chest and faded seed. However, the transition from repression to acceptance leans slightly tidy for such deep trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars ache, her breath hitches, her voice cracks—and her contradictions (chasing vs. heeding, fear vs. readiness) drive key choices. Her motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of hesitation that costs her old self. The golden-eyed figure functions as a psychological extension rather than a separate character, preserving single-POV integrity. However, the final transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over earned struggle, denying full 9+ status.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s recklessness and yearning for gentleness manifest through embodied choices—kneeling in bone-laced soil, sewing with trembling hands—not diagnostic labels. Her flaw directly causes the central wound (the drowned boy) and shapes her final act of stitching regret into resolve. The keeper functions as a pressure conduit rather than a full character, which fits the scope. However, the emotional shift toward “fiercely gentle wisdom” leans slightly abstract in the final paragraph, bordering on label-speak without fully dramatizing how this new stance alters future behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lenny’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “confidently uncertain” self-awareness, tactile relationship to the cloth, and emotional avoidance via appraisal manuals feel specific and consistent. His micro-choice to call the bassist emerges credibly from accumulated pressure, not epiphany. The ache of purposelessness is rendered without therapy-speak, grounded in frayed fabric and quarry blasts. However, his shift from isolation to mission lacks a visible on-page cost beyond implied vulnerability, slightly undercutting the Earned Stasis potential.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—“kindly methodical,” driven by analogical thinking—and her interiority avoids diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (chanting the incantation, placing the seed) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she risks failure to reestablish a fractured dialogue. The final renunciation isn’t of ambition but its redirection, earned through prior causality. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The librarian and the woman embody fluid identities with consistent, embodied contradictions—scales flickering to feathers, brass gears humming like tides. Their motivations arise organically from the world’s logic: shedding skin to preserve wonder, smelting selves to accept paradox. The child’s arrival deepens the thematic arc without diluting focus. All choices feel earned, costly, and inseparable from the story’s core conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and emotionally layered—his hesitation, tactile responses to the pearl and shell, and embodied awe feel authentic. His micro-choice to place the pearl at the spiral’s core emerges credibly from accumulated emotional pressure, not epiphany. The backstory with Lira is anchored by the pearl’s physical presence and informs his present action without over-explaining. However, secondary characters (farmer, scientist, child) appear only as spectral echoes, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath hitching, and tactile tracing of graffiti reveal layered guilt without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (stopping meds, drawing a heart-map) credibly stem from her truth-seeking flaw. The final act of walking away isn’t tidy forgiveness but a charged renunciation with visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (craving silence yet needing voices) operate simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority—sharp eyes beneath a veil, racing heart synced to a backward watch—feels embodied. However, her choices lack meaningful contradiction; she moves with near-perfect competence toward discovery without internal friction or misstep. The stolen watch implies moral ambiguity, but that tension isn’t dramatized in action or cost. Her final smile registers triumph, not transformation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, mulberry ache, and coffee-stained choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her contradictory impulses (throne vs. garden) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The telepathy with plants and ice violin feel character-specific, not gimmicks. Final renunciation is earned through micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, synchronized breath, and exhaustion convey emotional stakes without diagnostic labels. Her dual training as beautician mortician informs micro-choices (e.g., embellishing the emerald) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradiction between preservation and loss drives her actions credibly, with a visible cost in physical depletion. Final renunciation isn’t tidy but earned through precise, character-specific ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her trembling knees and the tactile handling of the shell and hairpin. Her forgiveness feels earned through prior causality, not sentimentality. However, Elara’s return lacks sufficient friction—her guilt and redemption are summarized rather than dramatized under pressure, weakening the crucible of their relationship. The micro-choice to descend the tree deliberately shows restraint, but Elara’s off-stage transformation undermines full motivation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and morally textured—his profession as a “conscience for hire” manifests in embodied choices (wearing the cloak, removing chimes) that reveal his hierarchy of values. Mira’s grief feels lived-in, not diagnostic, though her arc leans slightly on Elias’s interpretive authority. The “sincerely insincere” shrug and tactile handling of the mirror shard show consistent external/internal dissonance. Final cost—Elias offering clarity despite selling doubt—is earned but borders on neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s backward aging is embodied through specific physical and perceptual shifts—silver hair, flickering curiosity—and her withholding of knowledge reveals a hierarchy of values: truth must be earned, not given. Lira’s desperation feels authentic, and their dynamic functions as a crucible that forces Elara to endure the cost of silence. However, Elara’s internal contradiction (desire to teach vs. need to withhold) remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses, slightly softening motivation at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile perception and embodied ritual (e.g., the arrowhead warming against his chest), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His motivation—to navigate without moving—is rooted in generational trauma and personal failure, intensifying credibly toward resolution. However, the final epiphany (“alignment, not stillness”) arrives with minimal friction or contradictory impulse in-scene; it reads as earned by lore rather than dramatized struggle. The lack of active resistance to his insight slightly undercuts the “weathered resolve” promised by tone.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—his shame over magical failure, his yearning for authenticity, and his tearful epiphany feel earned. His micro-choices (stealing starlight, sketching his mother’s garden) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, the final transformation leans slightly into unearned sentimentality (“tears freezing on his cheeks” feels decorative rather than causally necessary), and his emotional arc resolves with tidy symmetry that softens the edge of his earlier underachievement.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, guilt, and yearning manifest through tactile details (the key tag burning against his thigh, the “stain” of Lila’s voice). His contradiction—hiding behind truth while chasing ghosts—is dramatized in micro-choices (wading into water, opening the door). The final renunciation (“I see you now”) is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges from sensory immersion, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and particular—his “quietly enthusiastic” curiosity contrasts with cosmic dread, embodied in tactile coin-handling and breath fogging glass. His micro-choices (selecting a coin, syncing with the deck) reveal a hierarchy of values: pattern over panic, signal over noise. The final alignment feels earned through prior struggle with static and doubt. However, his emotional shift from skepticism to certainty lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; the epiphany arrives cleanly without internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in guilt over Lira’s vanishing—is embodied through tactile actions (tracing the atlas, trembling hands) and internal contradiction (desire to name fears vs. fear of what naming unleashes). His micro-choices (using the prism despite resistance) reveal a hierarchy of values: remembrance over safety. The final renunciation (“Fear. And names.”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion degrades appropriately under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “earnestly naive” devotion is embodied through tactile actions—tracing cracks, rigging scaffolds—and his micro-choices (adjusting the bell’s tilt despite exhaustion) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His internal contradiction (brittle faith vs. persistent effort) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. Marla functions effectively as secondary pressure, her skepticism sharpening Elias’s resolve without caricature. The final grin—“brittle with exhaustion but warm with hope”—captures his flawed endurance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her vigilance wars with grief, embodied in tactile details like “fingers brushing the glassy surface” and the tightness in her chest. Her micro-choices (laying photos, sharing a new one) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from hoarding memory to stewarding it. The daughter’s appearance risks convenience but earns credibility through Elias’s eyes and rasping voice, grounding their relationship as crucible. Final renunciation—of solitary guarding for shared storytelling—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict between logic and intuition is vividly embodied through micro-choices (plunging hand into flame, tracing patterns with charred fingertips) and grounded in specific backstory that tilts present action. Her sentimentality isn’t just stated—it’s enacted in the closing gesture of tracing the starling’s footprint. However, the epiphany about “the touch of wonder” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“a permission, a surrender to the beauty of paradox”) rather than pure sensory realization, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—sweat, breath fogging light, muscle memory—and his motivation (preserving trust through inherited duty) intensifies under pressure. His micro-choices (buckle manipulation, node revision) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: exhaustion, isolation, and the weight of legacy. The mother’s absence functions as active emotional pressure, not mere backstory. However, the resolution leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the final “language” realization borders on diagnostic clarity without sufficient prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his numbness, feral grin, and emotional reawakening feel specific and earned. His motivation (“defeat emotional numbness”) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a decisive act that forecloses his clone’s existence with palpable cost. The clone’s cold mimicry effectively externalizes Kael’s internal fear, making their conflict psychologically coherent. However, the clone’s voice lacks distinct idiom beyond “smooth as oil,” slightly flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—safeguarding space for innovation—is credibly rooted in his backstory and shapes his actions, from examining the seed to planting it. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; curiosity manifests through tactile choices (soldering, carving, spectrometer use). The final renunciation of forced solutions (“answers emerged when you stopped forcing them”) feels earned by his methodical yet open approach. Minor deduction: his emotional response to panic (“Pot was empty…”) lacks embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlowe’s motivation is vividly rooted in loss and hope, with embodied emotion (blistered palms, trembling hands) and consistent micro-choices (persisting despite exhaustion). However, his internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—his “mournfully eager” state is asserted more than dramatized through simultaneous impulses. The final renunciation lacks a visible trade-off beyond physical fatigue, weakening the cost legibility required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her claws in ice, breath syncing with mist—and her contradictory impulses (homesickness vs. oath, fear of light vs. embrace of uncertainty) act simultaneously. Her final choice to toss the pendant is earned by prior causality: her mentor’s note (“Trust the fog”) and childhood symbols on the pendant. The cultist serves as immediate pressure without diluting focus. Only minor deduction: the cultist’s trembling voice slightly undercuts his void-eyed menace, softening the antagonistic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s stoic sensitivity is embodied through trembling hands, bleeding palms, and internal contradictions—absorbing failure while yearning to break free. His choice to pour his essence into the crozier feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost (scars, frayed mind). The mentor’s off-page presence exerts pressure through memory, not convenience. Final renunciation of paralysis aligns with prior causality and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to find the beginning in every ending—is compelling and consistent, driving his actions from mantra to dismantling. His interiority is concrete (“fingers flying over the controls,” “gritted teeth”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—letting go of assumptions to embrace silence—is earned through physical struggle and micro-choices (discarding cogs, syncing dials). However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves steadily toward revelation without internal friction that complicates his path.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s resilient positivity is embodied through micro-choices—clinging to the railing, broadcasting the signal—and falters credibly under pressure. His internal conflict between hope and dread is concrete (“fingers tightened,” “tears streaming”), not diagnostic. The final renunciation—sacrificing the ferry for passengers’ completion—is earned by his prior empathy and knowledge of their stories. However, secondary characters exist only as echoes, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s motivation—to prove logic and magic can coexist—is consistent and embodied through her weaving, but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from doubt to certainty without visible struggle. Her micro-choices (e.g., pulling thread, stepping through the door) reveal values, yet emotional embodiment leans abstract (“strange calm,” “heart pounding”) without visceral specificity. The curator functions as catalyst, not crucible, limiting relational pressure. Final renunciation of old perception is earned, though cost remains conceptual rather than felt in body or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her yearning for grounding amid cosmic expansion manifests through tactile handling of the chain link and pedagogical choices. Her contradiction (craving both stability and the unknown) plays out in-scene without summary. The final Charged Poise—teaching as self-navigation—is earned by prior beats. Minor deduction: Tarel’s question slightly flattens Lirael’s struggle into exposition rather than deepening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interiority is vivid and specific—her curiosity, grief-work ethic, and embodied reactions (e.g., breath hitching, mist on lashes) feel authentic. Her micro-choices (kneeling, using the hearing aid, following the pulse) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, listening over speaking. The final renunciation isn’t explicit but implied in her quiet departure—she endures the emotional weight without seeking reward. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are layered (“throat tightened,” “steps lighter”) without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s claustrophobia and grief are embodied with visceral specificity—her shallow breaths, trembling hands, and forced focus under rising water feel authentic and contradictory. Her motivation (to prove her brother mattered) intensifies credibly as pressure mounts, culminating in a micro-choice (slapping the gold fleck onto the terminal) that aligns with her obsession yet defies her fear. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution; tears blur vision even as she acts. However, the brother’s backstory lacks a concrete micro-choice that alters present tactics beyond general longing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hand, the shard’s pressure, heartbeat-counting—all reveal a psyche fractured by bureaucratic erasure yet clinging to proof of life. His motivation (to carry the woman’s “not-readiness” as wisdom) emerges organically from trauma, not exposition. The final choice—to defragment not for the machine but for himself and her ghost—is earned through consistent micro-choices (pressing the shard, tracing ink). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in porcelain edges and ink spirals.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storyteller’s motivation—translating texture into sound—is embodied through precise, sensory-rich actions and deepens credibly under pressure. Her internal contradiction (yearning to resurrect lost languages vs. fear of oblivion) culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. The final act—hurling the diamond—reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost: sacrificing the tool of translation to defy erasure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through copper-veined skin, searing palms, and shattering laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between scientific detachment and primal surrender—is embodied in tactile choices (clutching the arrowhead, resisting then embracing metamorphosis). Her motivation intensifies credibly from observation to transformation, driven by guilt-laden confessions that mirror her own buried bitterness. The herbalist functions as both mirror and catalyst, not mere expositor. Final renunciation of her human life carries felt cost: lab, sister, relevance—all abandoned for “lightness.”

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and embodied—her trembling hands, bleeding fingers, and use of the locust shell reveal a deep, personal struggle against mechanized order. Her internal contradiction (desire for chaos vs. fear of consequence) manifests in micro-choices like pressing the shell to the statue’s crack. The final insight avoids diagnostic label-speak and emerges through action. However, the statues’ lack of interiority limits relational crucible depth, though this is forgivable in single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—“to find where broken promises heal”—is embodied through micro-choices (smuggling the bottle, defying protocol) and contradictions (duty vs. rebellion). His interiority avoids therapy-speak, using concrete sensory cues (“brittle hush,” “cobalt glow”) to ground emotion. The final hum of the old woman’s tune shows earned endurance, not epiphany. However, his backstory lacks a specific on-page trigger that ties his past to the bottle’s release, slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elio’s motivation—to interpret silence as possibility—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (kneeling, brushing dust, singing). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges via sensory detail (“edges biting into his skin like a promise”). However, his transformation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—his arc moves linearly from seeker to fulfilled artist without internal friction that would justify a 9+. The final choice feels earned but not wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile perception and idiosyncratic worldview, with micro-choices (e.g., tracing the scarf, selecting books) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her “sanely eccentric” trait manifests in embodied action rather than label-speak, though her transformation lacks visible cost beyond emotional uplift—undercutting full Earned Stasis. The young patron functions as foil but exerts minimal pressure; their exchange serves theme more than character crucible. Final renunciation isn’t tested, softening the climax’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—chasing a “cipher of longing”—is vividly embodied through her ritualized actions and sensory engagement, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Her internal contradiction (desire to capture vs. need to release) manifests in precise micro-choices: climbing the lighthouse daily, mixing light like pigment, reaching toward the dream only to let it dissolve. The final renunciation feels earned because her flaw—treating longing as something to pin down—drives every prior beat. However, the dream’s personification slightly softens the cost; her transformation leans on lyric epiphany over tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, disorientation, and breath-held awe feel specific and human. His “unassumingly bold” contradiction drives a credible transgression against the woman’s wishes, rooted in longing rather than arrogance. The lock of hair as both burden and key crystallizes his emotional arc without therapy-speak. However, the woman remains an off-page cipher, limiting relational depth; her voice echoes but never pressures him directly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—recovering stolen memories through folklore and familial legacy—is deeply rooted in his identity as a folklorist and Clara’s vanished research. His curiosity drives tangible choices: using the sextant, mapping constellations, prying up the mushroom cap. The final moment of recognition with Clara feels earned, not sentimental, because it emerges from decades of embodied obsession. His flaws (stubbornness, isolation) compound his struggle without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s contradictory impulses—fear of reflection versus duty to guide—are embodied in her backward-walking habit and shard-mirror avoidance, grounding her mentorship in lived trauma. The young woman’s desperation creates immediate pressure that tests Lirael’s resolve without flattening either character into archetype. Emotional progression feels earned: Lirael’s rare smile signals a quiet shift from preservation to participation. However, the visitor remains slightly underdeveloped beyond her plea, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve wonder—is vividly embodied through her tactile rituals and emotional investment in the orchard’s fading hues. Her insatiable creativity manifests in precise, poetic actions (e.g., distilling sap with meteorite knife), not just labels. The final choice to hurl the seed carries visible cost: the hollow pocket, the iridescent blossom as both reward and burden. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her fear of “what I’ll find” ties directly to her history of mending masks without confronting their pain. Her micro-choices (working faster despite aching fingers, admitting fear) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort. Elias functions as effective secondary pressure, though his riddling risks archetype; his grounded presence (“shadow stretching across the net”) prevents abstraction. The final renunciation—choosing to listen rather than hide—is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his methodical curiosity manifests in precise actions (comparing film reels, using the sextant) rather than abstract musing. His emotional arc—from scholarly detachment to empathetic revelation—is embodied in tactile choices (holy water, ear to stone) and culminates in a credible reconfiguration of purpose. The grandfather’s journal provides motivation without over-explaining, and Elias’s flaw (over-reliance on logic) is subtly overcome through sensory surrender. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; the final insight arises organically from physical engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief lives in the snow globe’s storm, not in diagnostic labels. Her motivation (understanding “the physics of letting go”) arises organically from trauma and profession, driving every action. The final choice—to shake the globe not to watch but to feel resonance—is earned through prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No unmotivated epiphanies; even her scientific lens feels personal.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, longing, and guilt manifest through tactile actions (pressing flowers, etching walls) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (encoding messages for Lira, his brother, himself) reveal a hierarchy of unspoken needs with emotional cost. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing, and his final renunciation lacks a decisive foreclosed path—it’s poignant but not causally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “warmly inquisitive nature prickling” manifests in tactile choices (handling goggles, reading symbols) that reveal hierarchy of values. The widow’s porcelain mask and trembling hands create a crucible that forces Mara’s renunciation of silence for truth. Both characters remain flawed yet specific: the captain’s hidden vulnerability, the widow’s grief-as-armor. Final hand-to-chest gesture earns Charged Poise with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motivation—proving that “empty spaces remember”—is vividly embodied through her cloud categorization and tethered to personal loss (her mother). Her micro-choices (scribbling journal entries, adjusting the telescope) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. Voss serves as effective secondary pressure without overshadowing Lila’s internal arc. The final renunciation (“it’ll change me”) is earned by prior causality and carries quiet, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s face blindness isn’t a gimmick—it shapes how she perceives truth through texture and hue, grounding her emotional arc in sensory specificity. Her micro-choices (e.g., pressing the coin into the panel, altering her painting plan) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over documentation. The final act—walking away with the safe—feels earned because her internal contradiction (artist vs. archivist) resolves through tactile intuition, not exposition. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in brushstrokes and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s curiosity is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, slanting handwriting, knee on cold metal—and drives every choice with escalating stakes. Her internal contradiction (diligence vs. defiance) surfaces in micro-choices: ignoring the captain, trusting birds over authority. Jax’s presence adds relational pressure without overshadowing her agency. The leap feels earned because her trait compels risk, not recklessness.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to mend time through the “rhythm of repair”—is deeply personal and rooted in childhood memory, embodied in tactile details like his father’s workshop and the vial of liquid light. His internal conflict between doubt and determination manifests concretely in the Hall of Mirrors, where reflections multiply his uncertainty. The final choice to open the chest feels earned, not epiphanic, and carries emotional cost tied to legacy. However, the resolution leans slightly toward tidy reconciliation without fully dramatizing the struggle of self-repair.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s altruism and consistency are clearly rooted in her promise to protect Luminara, and her motivation intensifies credibly as the arches crumble. Her interiority is conveyed through embodied choices—materializing at dawn to chalk messages, guiding droplets with intangible fingers—rather than abstract self-reflection. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, showing her doubt (“wondering if her messages were clear enough”) before witnessing collective action. Her final renunciation—fading into twilight after orchestrating unity—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of continued solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, rough voice, and emotional inheritance from her grandfather ground her motivation in tactile memory. Her flaws (doubt, fear of miscalculation) directly shape her climactic choice to sing despite imperfection. The broken puppet head functions as both heirloom and psychological mirror, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the shift from fear to acceptance occurs with minimal on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—driven by curse-enforced duty and visceral hatred of the mechanical birds—is clear, consistent, and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., pressing pebbles, snapping twigs). His internal conflict between reluctance and responsibility manifests physically (“movements jerky, ungraceful”) without diagnostic self-awareness. The final shove into the tunnel reads as earned endurance under pressure, not passive compliance. However, the traveler’s minimal presence limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—atonement through reconnection—is rooted in consistent traits (symphonic thinking, scientific precision) and intensifies credibly. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief manifests through embodied choices (avoiding the studio, pocketing the chrysalis). The final micro-choice to hum with Mara reveals a hierarchy of values: harmony over perfection. However, Mara’s shift from tense silence to immediate collaboration lacks intermediate friction, slightly undercutting relational causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her belief in “void as origin” shapes her actions and emotional responses. The man’s arrival triggers genuine internal tension, not just thematic musing. Her final realization feels earned through observation rather than epiphany, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. However, her interior contradiction remains subtle rather than active under pressure, limiting the score’s ascent into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nessar’s motivation—to “sandpaper rough memories”—is embodied in tactile, sensory choices that escalate under pressure, culminating in his submersion into the founder’s guilt. His internal contradiction (desire to heal vs. risk of entanglement) plays out through concrete action, not summary. The final cooking scene reveals a hierarchy of values: nourishment over erasure, endurance over resolution. His flaw—absorbing others’ remorse—is consistent, costly, and never hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her belief that “machines, like people, had stories to tell,” and her actions—soldering, singing, whispering languages—are consistent extensions of her empathetic decisiveness. Her internal contradiction (precision vs. tenderness) manifests physically in her “vigorous tenderness.” However, the story leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“empathetically decisive”) without dramatizing a true flaw or blind spot that complicates her success. The resolution feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond implied emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through fractal metaphors and embodied tension, with micro-choices (e.g., adjusting dials “chaotically precise”) revealing his hierarchy of values. His motivation—to fuse abandoned dreams with his psyche—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: trauma → epiphany lacks credible irrationality or self-deception. The final smile feels earned but borders on diagnostic (“rewiring reality itself”) without deeper contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—seeking “seeds of vigilance”—is rooted in her identity as a “prism-minded archivist,” and her choices (e.g., selecting the left tunnel, tracing the doodle) reveal a hierarchy of values under time pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“mind a kaleidoscope of overlapping timelines”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final choice—to become a “keeper of thresholds”—is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost remains abstract rather than embodied in a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is fiercely consistent and embodied—her bleeding nails, aching shoulders, and bone-deep listening reveal a symphonically minded soul whose empathy drives every micro-choice. Her internal contradiction (creating sound in silence) never resolves neatly but deepens into earned endurance. The hedgehog and alders function as environmental mirrors, not secondary characters, preserving single-POV integrity. Final renunciation—continuing to sculpt despite shattered tools—carries visible cost and crystallizes her identity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Alaric’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile interaction with the stone, his memory of Lira, and his emotional restraint all reveal a man shaped by exile and conviction. His motivation (to honor a forgotten covenant through chess-as-cosmos) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of passive waiting for active translation. The final choice—to plant the seed—is earned by prior micro-choices: kneeling, pressing palm to stone, inserting Lira’s key. His flaw (rigid precision) becomes his strength without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s motivation—cataloging silence as a language—is consistent, embodied in her humming and tactile interaction with tools, and intensifies under pressure (fireworks’ intrusion). Her internal contradiction (pacifist yet driven to force open the past) manifests through micro-choices: rejecting picks/oil for resonance. The epiphany feels earned because it arises from action, not reflection alone. However, her emotional state remains slightly too calibrated—grief lacks irrational edges.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s ambition, olfactory sensitivity, and internal conflict between urgency and patience are vividly embodied and drive key choices. Her transformation—from forcing growth to embracing stillness—is earned through micro-choices (e.g., switching from active tending to mindful doodling). The elders’ skepticism provides external pressure that sharpens her resolve without flattening them into caricatures. However, the epiphany via dream risks slight diagnostic clarity (“Wisdom grows in the hush”), though it’s offset by immediate behavioral change.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in scientific curiosity and stewardship, not exploitation. Her interiority is concrete (“The planet’s name, Vespera, meant ‘gathering of echoes’”) and her final renunciation—choosing protection over extraction—is earned by the discovery that resilience stems from symbiosis, not machinery. The broken arrow tip functions as both compass and moral pivot, and her micro-choices (following water flow, pressing the tip into the socket) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she abandons the hope of a technological fix. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion is embodied in tactile interactions with vines, spheres, and soil.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Anya’s motivation is rooted in personal loss and professional rigor, embodied through tactile details like the warm, vibrating patch and her methodical sensor adjustments. Her internal conflict—balancing grief with forensic precision—is rendered without therapy-speak, and her micro-choices (climbing, documenting despite danger) reveal a hierarchy of values. The engineer’s brief appearance applies immediate pressure, but his transformation feels slightly underexplored, limiting full relationship crucible payoff. Her endurance at the end constitutes Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s synesthetic perception and yearning to “certify wonder as essential” drive every action with emotional and thematic coherence. Her micro-choices—pressing the amber sheet to her lips, aligning song with auroral hues—are embodied, specific, and rooted in her gift. Veyra’s shift from skepticism to awe feels earned through sensory intrusion rather than exposition. Both characters remain vividly individualized without safety-hedging, though Veyra’s transformation leans slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—harvesting insight from failure—is embodied through specific, painful memories and micro-choices (e.g., playing discordant notes, snapping the flute). His internal conflict between grief and duty manifests physically (trembling hands, roaring “Enough!”), avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The final act of etching a rune for surrender feels earned by his prior struggle, though the mentor’s reappearance slightly softens the cost. Flaws drive action without safety-hedging, yet the emotional arc leans marginally tidy in its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—reducing emotion to math—is compellingly rooted in his personality-borrowing habit and drives every action. His internal contradiction (analytical detachment vs. yearning for understanding) culminates in a credible, embodied shift when the fragment transposes empathy. Veyra applies immediate, relevant pressure as both foil and mirror. The final renunciation of borrowed selves is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kail’s jittery interiority is embodied through tactile details (satchel strap, pendant vibrations) and micro-choices (hesitation before planting the seed). His contradiction—distrusting yet obeying Veyra—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final realization feels earned because his prior doubt and obedience coexist under pressure. However, the woman’s sudden appearance lacks reciprocal status dynamics, slightly flattening their exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her storm-gray eyes, tactile communion with stone and frost, and diagnostic-free emotional absorption feel specific and grounded. Her motivation (proving emotion imprints on matter) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her original goal with felt cost. The flaw lies in the late-stage doubt (“truthful lies of her method”) arriving as near-diagnostic label-speak rather than fully dramatized contradiction; it slightly undermines the otherwise earned epiphany. Still, her final laugh—“bitter and free”—resonates as authentic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—wistful hope to stitch the world back together—is consistent and embodied through her loom work, amber bead rituals, and pursuit of the puzzle. Her final renunciation (letting go of the bead) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using tactile metaphors (“sunlight dripped like liquid gold,” “silence frayed like old fabric”) that feel character-specific. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; she never truly wavers, reducing psychological tension.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jorin’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—meekness paired with quiet resolve—and intensifies credibly under pressure. His internal contradiction (fear vs. duty) manifests physically in the mine, especially when shards strike and he endures without flinching. The final choice to absorb Veyra’s pain feels earned by his prior micro-choices: studying the silk, ignoring Mara, selecting the center tunnel. However, Lira’s sudden appearance lacks relational buildup, slightly weakening the crucible dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in maternal loss and the shard’s compulsion—is consistent and embodied, driving his climactic renunciation. His internal conflict (curiosity vs. caution) manifests physically through grip, breath, and trembling hands. The mother-figure’s presence sharpens emotional stakes without melodrama. Final choice feels earned, though her dialogue leans slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence feels lived-in, not performative—his micro-choices (stacking stones, placing the glass) reveal a hierarchy of values without over-explanation. His emotional shift from duty-bound isolation to quiet participation is earned through tactile engagement with the letters and sea glass. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; his change manifests in action, not epiphany. However, the final smile borders on uncharacteristic softness without a stronger prior crack in his stoicism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Herald’s interiority is vividly embodied—her laughter, breath-catching, and trembling grip convey emotional complexity without diagnostic labels. Her motivation (shaping the dawn through ancient shadows) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where she accepts her role with quiet resolve. Contradictory impulses—between control and surrender, light and dark—are active in scene, not summarized. The final choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost implied in her isolation and the weight of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her post-transplant sensory hunger feels visceral, not diagnostic. Her motivation to understand story-magnetism arises credibly from bodily change, and her final commitment emerges from observed human connection, not epiphany. However, the “two people” metaphor edges toward abstraction, slightly softening the otherwise concrete emotional arc. No secondary characters exert pressure; the travelers serve as chorus, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—his tactile engagement with sorrow, the sextant, and tree roots reveals a worldview shaped by quiet devotion. His motivation (to uncover what trees witness) drives concrete micro-choices: dismantling the sextant, sketching constellations, stepping through the wall. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; he moves steadily without hesitation or self-doubt, softening emotional complexity. The final renunciation of closure (“work never done”) feels earned but costless—no path is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused hands, raw humming, and breath catching at the child’s melody reveal contradiction between exhaustion and resolve. Her motivation (rekindling memory) intensifies organically through micro-choices: pressing her palm to the mica, leaning against the tree in earned stasis. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile action. Final renunciation of solitude (“lonely one… but tonight”) carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s motivation—grief-driven curiosity—is consistent and embodied, especially in her tactile handling of the invitation and hesitation at the blank book. Her internal conflict (wanting connection but fearing exposure) manifests through micro-choices like drifting toward the center table yet intending only to hide. The final realization—that hiding can be a form of selective revelation—feels earned by her empathy and prior restraint. However, the society members remain archetypal, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete sensory perception and micro-choices—his hesitation before the bread, his trembling hands in the soil—that reveal a consistent, character-specific worldview. His “heuristically gentle” approach manifests as embodied restraint, not abstraction, and his final act of planting seeds earns a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: calloused hands, solitude, and the weight of memory. The brief appearance of the old woman avoids sentimentality by remaining enigmatic yet purposeful, reinforcing Elias’s arc without resolving it for him. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies mar his emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a meticulous archivist confronting entropy. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers tracing the edges,” “hummed a tuning fork”), and her frustration manifests in embodied action (“slammed her fist”). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she shifts from calm precision to urgency without internal friction, missing the complexity expected at this tier. The resolution feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her stubbornness, grief, and resolve manifest through tactile details (the fob, caked boots) and micro-choices (sacrificing the heirloom). Her emotional contradiction—defiance versus inherited silence—is active in-scene, not summarized. The buyer’s brief presence sharpens Lira’s agency without diluting focus. However, the father’s off-page influence borders on motivational shorthand, slightly weakening full causality for her final act.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s skepticism is embodied through precise sensory contradictions—his disbelief in “heartbeats” clashes with his reliance on the compass and taste-based sensing. His micro-choices (kneeling, tasting, stumbling back) reveal a hierarchy of values: empirical curiosity over emotional safety. Lira’s presence forces a credible endurance—accepting mystery without resolution—and the cost (regret, disorientation) is felt in the final lavender-and-regret taste. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are filtered through weather metaphors consistent with his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—uncorking suppressed creativity—is viscerally embodied through charcoal-stained fingers, hesitant brushstrokes, and the haunting memory of his artistic boyhood. His internal conflict between safety and truth manifests in concrete micro-choices: bringing the canvas, painting the lock as a screaming mouth, fitting it into the shadow-door. The grandmother’s mnemonic gift functions more as thematic echo than active pressure, slightly weakening causal depth. Still, his final sketching feels earned, not epiphanic, with the cost of years of silence legible in his trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, rooted in her mother’s disappearance and her calligrapher’s truth-sensing quill. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile details like the wilting quill and ink that “shimmered like poisoned honey.” The final choice to accept an “empty” orb as a “seed” feels earned, reconfiguring loss into generative hope with visible emotional cost. The keeper’s brief presence serves as crucible without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve wonder through silence—is vividly embodied in her actions and choices, especially her vow of seasonal muteness and the construction of the kinetic sculpture. Her interiority is rendered with poetic specificity (“fingers deft as they adjusted the tension…”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she operates with near-total clarity and competence, reducing emotional friction. The final renunciation (letting the symphony transform) is earned but carries minimal visible cost beyond the melting ice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara-7’s internal conflict—between programmed order and emergent organic chaos—is embodied in trembling fingers, creaking joints, and static-laced perception. Her motivation to “miniaturize chaos” arises credibly from her origin as a container of human fears, and her final choice to absorb rather than destroy the orb feels earned. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile detail (“bioluminescent threads that pulsed like a heartbeat”) and micro-choices (activating the plasma torch despite risk). Her flawed, aching wholeness reads as individual, not archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s motivation—rooted in her belief that objects hold stories—is consistent and compelling, driving her investigative actions. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers tracing the engraving,” “mind already racing”), and her emotional arc culminates in tears that feel earned. However, secondary characters (Mrs. Ruiz, Mr. Hale, Aisha) serve primarily as exposition vectors rather than crucibles of pressure, limiting relational depth. The final choice to open the mailbox via historical dates feels slightly convenient but is mitigated by prior lore-gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained fingers, breath fogging visor—and his motivation (liberating truth, not just solving puzzles) intensifies under pressure. His final dance is a credible extension of his lyrical code-breaking identity, merging intellect and emotion. However, the scientist remains a cipher; her influence is profound but she never functions as a crucible since she’s only holographic. The story skirts diagnostic label-speak (“vulnerability is not weakness”) but avoids full epiphany by grounding it in action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in loss and embodied through tactile rituals (pressed wildflowers, coffee-ground divination). His internal contradiction—yearning for memory while fearing its void—is consistent and deepens under pressure. The final choice to lay down the flowers beside the rose feels earned, with visible emotional cost. However, his wife’s erasure remains abstract; her absence lacks specific sensory or behavioral counterpoints that would sharpen his longing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The summoner’s motivation is vividly rooted in her solitary identity and prophetic duty, with embodied emotion (e.g., “fingers tracing the crane’s origami wing”) and micro-choices (placing the wing at water’s edge) that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception (“mind tracing contours of unspoken sounds”). However, internal contradiction remains underdeveloped—her struggle leans more on atmospheric tension than competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his scholarly caution, tactile engagement with the seal, and emotional restraint feel authentic. His final choice to speak the building’s language emerges credibly from his established expertise and quiet yearning. The woman’s “patiently nimble” trait manifests in action (stepping over pavers) and stance (“let him piece together fragments”), though her backstory remains slightly under-anchored. Their dynamic as mutual keepers of fictions deepens believably, with embodied tension in gestures like the sugar-jar brush.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s interior contradiction—skepticism wrapped in charm, radiance masking archival pain—is embodied through tactile interactions (brushing petals, clutching shells) and micro-choices (arranging shells, pressing palm to dirt). Her final act of repurposing memory feels earned, though the emotional shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The “quarantined memory” concept risks diagnostic phrasing but is grounded by physical sensation (“sparks... burning but not hurting”). Cost is visible: the garden’s destruction, her mother’s absence made active rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lirael’s motivation—forgiving the unfinished—is embodied in precise, costly actions: pricking her thumb with the cursed thorn, sealing lies with blood, choosing grace over rebellion. Her interior contradiction (treason as forgiveness) is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness, and her micro-choices (e.g., tucking away the now-useless thorn) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—vanishing after placing the scroll—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional and physical cost (aching joints, echoing footsteps as countdown). No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity is integral, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in his role as echo singer and the frayed hum of the seashell. His interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile interactions with stone, shell, and song—but leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction in peak moments (“melancholy swelling”) without sufficient contradictory impulses. The final choice to keep singing is earned, though the cost (emotional burden of bearing others’ stories) is implied rather than dramatized through a micro-choice under pressure. The figure’s exposition slightly softens Kael’s active struggle, making his epiphany feel guided rather than wrested.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his reverence for fragile truths, tactile communion with ice and glass, and moral restraint feel specific and consistent. His micro-choices (e.g., placing the globe on the altar rather than keeping it) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: he sacrifices personal possession to restore ancestral peace. The ghost’s dialogue avoids diagnostic phrasing, using wind-and-reed imagery that aligns with setting and character. However, secondary characters exist only in dreams without on-page pressure, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his calloused hands, salt-stained hair, and tactile engagement with netting and whisk ground his philosophical bent in physicality. His motivation (“to appreciate hidden effort”) drives micro-choices (mending, whistling, tracing firefly rhythms) that feel consistent and character-specific. However, the epiphany about “hidden patterns” leans slightly toward unearned conceptual clarity rather than struggle-born insight. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation—truth-seeking as survival—drives every key choice and culminates in a costly renunciation that feels earned. Her interiority is concrete (“gloved hands brushing aside radioactive grit”), and her skepticism evolves without sentimentality. The flawed diamond forces a moral calculus where belief gives way to consequence, not epiphany. However, Dr. Crane’s absence limits relational pressure, slightly muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—shaping a new dawn from ancient shadows—is vividly embodied in his radio-tuning rituals, erratic handwriting, and physical interaction with the portico. His internal conflict (isolation vs. communion with prophetic voices) manifests through concrete micro-choices, like activating the refraction mechanism. However, his transformation into “both seer and storm” leans slightly toward epiphany over earned causality; the shift lacks a decisive prior beat that forecloses his old path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to “sweeten the world’s sharp edges” as a bridge between generations—is embodied through concrete action (collecting sounds, testing verses) and internal contradiction (self-doubt vs. poetic faith). His micro-choices (selecting jars, revising lines) reveal hierarchy of values with cost: time, dignity, hope. The old woman’s reaction validates his purpose without resolving his vagrancy, preserving flaw and stakes. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion lives in tactile detail (“tears pricking his eyes,” “pockets jingled with coins”).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “logically emotional” tension manifests in physical strain, micro-choices (adjusting dials under duress), and a credible arc from technician to bridge-builder. The ghost confrontation forces a stance that reconfigures his understanding of legacy, not just duty. However, the transition from engineer to mystic feels slightly accelerated; the epiphany leans on poetic phrasing (“bridge it well”) over granular struggle. Still, his flaws (rigid rationality) complicate early choices and are meaningfully transcended.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and embodied—his impatience, fatigue, and growing steadiness manifest through tactile choices (resetting filings, ignoring back pain) rather than abstract self-diagnosis. His flaw (haste) directly causes his first failure, and his earned endurance forecloses the path of force, aligning with the elders’ “patient revolution.” The acolyte scene reveals his transformed hierarchy of values without sentimentality. Minor deduction: his emotional shift leans slightly tidy, lacking deeper irrational contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, tightening jaw, and watchful calm under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her motivation intensifies credibly from professional doubt to moral revolt, rooted in consistent traits (empathy, empirical rigor). The final renunciation of Cole’s control feels earned, not epiphanic, though the shift from pawn to agent slightly accelerates without showing the precise micro-choice that severs compliance. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Father Marcus’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his deliberateness shapes his perception and choices without over-articulation. The clockwork heart catalyzes a quiet but credible shift from skepticism to conviction, grounded in embodied response (“breath caught”) rather than diagnostic labels. Mrs. Elms functions effectively as secondary pressure, though her role borders on archetype; her warmth feels earned by context, not convenience. The inmate’s off-page presence resonates through the object he made, preserving moral ambiguity without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly rooted in obsession with the arrow tip and the bell, driving every action with escalating stakes. Her interiority—“gears with feet,” “steadily curious”—is character-specific and embodied through tactile engagement with tools and environment. The final hurl of the arrow tip feels earned by years of study and micro-choices (e.g., pressing tip to kaleidoscope). Cost is legible: she risks crashing, and the acid sea threatens her workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, rooted in personal obsession with Elara’s case. Her interiority is concrete (“brightly attentive gaze,” tactile handling of the patch), and her final renunciation—refusing to surrender data despite drones—earns Charged Poise. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she never wavers or second-guesses, flattening emotional complexity. Hale’s presence applies pressure but doesn’t force a relational crucible beyond surface antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “calmly intuitive” nature manifests in micro-choices like merging reflections with mirror images, not just stated. Her motivation (empathy as antidote to collective fear) intensifies coherently under pressure. The final act—choosing to reconstitute empathy despite fear—is earned by her consistent traits and prior glimpses. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“boots crunching on frozen wood,” “weighted breath”).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s numb detachment is embodied with precision—her trawling, parasol grip, and cold-induced pain register as authentic micro-choices under pressure. Her interior contradiction (seeking endings yet acting to save) culminates in a renunciation that forecloses her euthanasia path with quiet cost. The rescued woman functions as catalyst, not crucible; their interaction lacks reciprocal pressure, limiting relational depth. Still, Lila’s arc earns its Earned Stasis without diagnostic self-awareness or tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias and Lila feel individuated, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal internal conflict—Lila’s abandonment of her easel, Elias’s offering of the letter. Their dialogue carries subtext and status shifts subtly. However, Lila’s transformation leans slightly on Elias’s aphoristic wisdom rather than fully dramatized struggle, softening the cost of her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “strangely honest” trait manifests in embodied choices—mask slipping, laughter like wind chimes, unflinching gaze—that reveal internal conflict between concealment and authenticity. Her motivation to preserve wisdom is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in earned endurance (Earned Stasis). The prophet functions effectively as a catalyst rather than a full character, avoiding overextension. However, his recoil at her scars feels slightly performative without deeper exploration of his own limits.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her grief, observational habits, and belief in collective healing shape her actions without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (sketching, keeping the feather) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her motivation remains largely reflective rather than pressured by external opposition, limiting escalation. The final renunciation (“enough”) feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s reticence is embodied through tactile interactions with books and the crystal, not just stated. His internal contradiction—craving solitude yet feeling urgency to share—emerges organically in micro-choices (e.g., jotting notes, returning the crystal). The final shift from silence to testimony feels earned, though the emotional cost of breaking his reticence remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through tactile rituals (chalk, driftwood) and micro-choices that reveal his desperate grasp for coherence. His internal contradiction—between longing to remember and inability to hold visions—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of drawing a bolder line earns his renunciation of needing the future, with visible cost in raw hands and aching knees. However, the emotional climax leans slightly on lyric abstraction rather than fully dramatized physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to harness the ephemeral—is vividly embodied through his tactile relationship with instruments and light, and his final leap feels earned by his consistent struggle against entropy. His internal contradiction (desire to fix time vs. acceptance of transience) manifests physically in trembling hands and humming voice. However, the emotional climax leans slightly on abstract phrasing (“luminous ache”) rather than fully grounded sensation, costing a few tenths. No secondary characters dilute focus, and his micro-choices—using the ear trumpet, soldering wires—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, professional devotion, and personal echoes of her mother are rendered through tactile details (the vinyl shard, humming) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a micro-choice (offering the hymn) that carries emotional cost. Elias and Clara function effectively as a crucible, though Clara borders on reactive archetype. The flaw: Mira’s “decisively kind” trait remains asserted more than dramatized through trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lirael’s motivation—finding where shadows go at noon—is specific, emotionally resonant, and drives her scholarly obsession with tangible cost (three sleepless nights, bloodshot eyes). Her “quietly deliberate” trait manifests in steady hands during urgency and methodical cross-referencing, embodying competence under pressure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are shown through physical strain and focused action. The final revelation feels earned by her sustained effort, though the internal contradiction between curiosity and caution remains underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s skepticism and “shrewdly innocent curiosity” manifest in embodied choices—testing thorns, using bone-setting tools—that reveal a layered interiority. Elias’s return forces a credible emotional recalibration rooted in shared history, not sentimentality. Their dynamic operates as crucible: his revelation reframes her quest from proof to reconciliation. The final renunciation of certainty-as-control feels earned, with cost legible in Mara’s trembling hand and tempered worldview.

    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her mother’s vanished wisdom and the imperative to share light without fire—is consistent, embodied, and deepened through micro-choices (selecting the gem, weighing it, releasing it). Her internal contradiction between chasing spectacle and embracing stillness resolves credibly in action, not epiphany. The shard left in her pocket signals enduring struggle, not tidy closure. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority; emotion lives in tactile detail (“fingers traced,” “breath steadied”).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, shame, and hope manifest through tactile actions (tracing stains, unclasping the pendant) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradiction—fear of losing her brother again versus desire to heal—is dramatized in real time. Elias’s quiet proactivity emerges through consistent micro-choices (bringing orchids, kneeling, planting), not exposition. Their final exchange reveals a hierarchy of values: connection over isolation, growth over stasis—with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s interior conflict—between her desire for neat endings and the messy vitality of true closure—is embodied through micro-choices (deleting the final chapter, tracing the shell) and consistent emotional contradiction. Her motivation is rooted in professional shame and creative longing, intensifying credibly under pressure. The stranger’s appearance functions as a projection of Clara’s own insight rather than externalized plot device, preserving agency. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“hope was a current”) without sufficient struggle against it, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to restore fading magic through forgotten songs—is consistent and embodied in her tinkerer’s hands, sleepless nights, and aching fingers. Her internal conflict (dreamer vs. practical restorer) manifests subtly but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel earnest rather than fraught. The rabbit’s dialogue (“It worked”) risks sentimentality, but Lira’s reply (“sacred practices need tenders”) grounds her arc in responsibility, not just whimsy. Final renunciation of solo heroism is earned, though the cost—exhaustion—is lightly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his aching fingers, trembling touch, and breath-fogged resolve ground his emotional arc in physical sensation. His motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) emerges organically through action, not exposition, and his patience is tested credibly across repeated failures. The epiphany feels earned because it arises from tactile engagement with the plate, not abstract musing. However, his internal contradiction remains subtle rather than active; we see discipline, not struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s peripherally focused nature is concretely embodied in his method (mirror, light angles) and shapes every key decision. His internal conflict—wonder vs. reason—is dramatized through tactile choices (e.g., doubting the “cellar of reason” as a grave). The final smile and descent show earned endurance with conceptual cost: he preserves wonder but doesn’t consume it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, sweat, and fragmented humming reveal emotional complexity without diagnostic labels. His renunciation of his mother’s locket is earned through prior restraint and thematic consistency, foreclosing a path with palpable cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief) act simultaneously during the obsidian burden scene. The final micro-choice—to leave the locket untouched—is rooted in character-specific limits and honors the story’s moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests in tactile hesitation, sensory memory, and micro-choices like lighting a candle or sipping honeyed tea. Her motivation to carve stems credibly from her husband’s note and her need to “contain chaos,” not abstract therapy-speak. The final act of carving enacts Earned Stasis: she accepts loss without being consumed, foreclosing the path of avoidance with visible emotional cost. Only minor deduction for slightly tidy emotional resolution; real grief rarely yields such lyrical clarity so soon.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s interiority is vividly embodied—her calloused fingers, eroded dreams, and visceral regret—but her final renunciation lacks a micro-choice that visibly alters tactics. The ghost dialogue risks diagnostic label-speak (“You haven’t forgiven yourself”), yet the emotional arc feels earned through concrete actions like dropping the camera wheel. Her contradiction—clinging to fragments while seeking release—is sustained in-scene. However, the shift from active scavenger to passive surrender at the end slightly undercuts agency required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lila’s motivation is clear and consistent—her “functional creativity” drives her engineering choices and emotional arc. Interiority is concrete (“mind racing with structural calculations”), and her final act (building the equation) reflects a credible synthesis of logic and hope. However, the emotional stakes remain abstract; her restlessness lacks embodied contradiction or a tangible personal cost that would elevate this to 9+. The sextant pendant feels symbolic rather than psychologically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her longing for wildness wars with her devotion to order, embodied in ink-stained fingers and trembling outreach to quartz. Her micro-choices (stepping into the forecourt, touching the stone) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The bear encounter avoids diagnostic label-speak; fear dissolves through sensory engagement, not exposition. Final renunciation (“not leave… yet”) feels earned by prior causality and carries opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to unravel historical deception—is consistent and compelling, and his internal conflict (truth vs. self-deception) is credibly embodied. However, his emotional arc lacks concrete contradiction in-scene; the “lies he’d told himself” remain abstract rather than dramatized through micro-choices. His final realization feels earned by object logic but not by visceral struggle. The captain serves only as a cautionary echo, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving ancient knowledge through natural forms—is consistent, embodied in his calloused hands and decades-long study of the rope. His internal conflict (aging eyesight vs. lifelong quest) manifests in concrete choices: using the fulgurite as a lens, kneeling in snow to decode knots. The final renunciation—accepting that the weavers’ legacy is preservation itself—is earned by prior causality. However, the woman’s appearance introduces slight external validation that slightly softens the autonomy of his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her profession as an obituarist for the living shapes her perception and actions. Her internal conflict (desire to explain absence vs. the pain of confronting loss) manifests in micro-choices like kneeling, touching the thread, and writing mid-vision. However, the vanished woman remains spectral rather than interactive, limiting relational crucible depth. The final renunciation—accepting explained absences as beginnings—is earned through tactile engagement with memory.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corvin’s motivation is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, tattered doublet, and obsessive notes reveal a prince defined by grief and fragile hope. His internal contradiction (despair vs. belief) drives micro-choices like assembling the contraption or whispering to the egg. However, his emotional shift at the climax lacks sufficient friction; the tears and sudden steadiness feel slightly unearned given minimal prior resistance beyond solitude. Elder Thalos’s arrival introduces a second character cleanly but doesn’t deepen Corvin’s core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, restlessness, and rechanneled purpose feel lived-in rather than explained. Her micro-choices (using the coin as a talisman, splinting the wing) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma. The final line—“scars... sang”—is earned through her actions, not asserted. However, the child Mara’s emotional arc leans slightly archetypal, softening the crucible’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—skeptic yet realistically imaginative—is vividly embodied in her trembling hands and persistent doubt even amid success. Her micro-choices (kneeling, prying the drain) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, memory over silence. The cost is felt in scraped fingers and emotional exposure, not just stated. However, her flaw never truly complicates her path; every breadcrumb appears precisely when needed, softening the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lumin’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, aching heart, dreams of healing fire—and their contradictory impulses (longing for ancestral flame vs. Enclave’s quiet light) drive every micro-choice. The ghost encounter crystallizes motivation without epiphany-speak, and the final renunciation of violent fire feels earned through tactile memory and inherited trauma. Flaws are active: sentimentality risks nostalgia, yet Lumin chooses refinement over repetition. Cost is legible in the gear’s abandonment—a tool of calculation surrendered to intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlow’s interiority is vividly embodied—his chisel-calloused hands, unspoken grief, and tactile interactions with the ribbon convey emotional weight without therapy-speak. His motivation—to discover the shape of collective grief—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (returning nightly, reading his poem). However, the “spectral mentorship” voice borders on diagnostic exposition (“Your family’s grief is not a burden, but a bridge”), slightly undermining earned epiphany. Final renunciation of silence feels credible but leans on a single climactic act rather than layered causality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirael’s interiority is concrete and particular—her “ethically diligent mind rejecting haste” informs her slow, tactile engagement with the ridge and pendulum. Her micro-choices (kneeling, clutching the rake, whispering the inscription) reveal a hierarchy of values: harmony over force, patience over panic. The grandfather memory isn’t expository; it reframes present action through embodied legacy. Final renunciation of mechanical fixes in favor of ritualized care feels earned, with raw hands as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the “shape of intentions”—is consistent and compelling, rooted in her role as a cemetery gardener. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers calloused,” “mind adrift in quiet rhythms”), and her final renunciation (reburying the case) carries conceptual cost. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses; she moves from curiosity to revelation without internal friction or hesitation that would deepen character complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—mapping possibility through predictive modeling—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (fear vs. craving the blank page) manifests physically and intellectually, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The kingfisher quill symbolizes courage she must borrow, not claim outright, making her final endurance feel earned. Her renunciation of old journals carries visible cost: the sacrifice of past certainty for an uncertain future.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to “teach dust to tell stories”—is rooted in personal loss and necessity, not nobility, and her interiority is vividly embodied through tactile details (fogged dial, snagging pencil). Her micro-choices—leaning closer, scribbling feverishly—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: isolation, chill, emotional exposure. The father’s cloak functions as both emotional anchor and physical weight, deepening her contradiction between vulnerability and resolve. However, the final renunciation lacks a decisive foreclosed path; her endurance feels cyclical rather than transformative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fatigue, resolve, and artistic compulsion feel specific and contradictory. Her micro-choices (removing the mask, leaving the portrait unfinished) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Elias functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. However, her motivation borders on abstract (“crystallize a fleeting emotion”) without deeper personal anchoring, slightly weakening emotional causality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—preserving ancient navigation as rebellion—is vividly embodied in his handling of the cog and needle, and his “rationally rebellious” stance fuels credible micro-choices (e.g., refusing to sell the cog). His internal conflict between idealism and futility manifests physically through bleeding hands and aching back, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Mara functions effectively as secondary pressure, though her shift lacks full causality. The final endurance (“he finally felt… understood”) reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s motivation is vividly rooted in intergenerational loss and cultural preservation, embodied through her tactile engagement with the zither and vocal responses to Elias’s violin. Her internal contradiction—between grief for vanishing arts and active hope through harmony—is rendered without diagnostic labels. Elias’s “expectantly resigned” demeanor subtly shifts as he plays, revealing a hierarchy of values (memory over silence) with emotional cost. However, secondary characters beyond Elias lack individuation, reducing relational pressure despite their thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her synesthetic gift and personal rebellion, with micro-choices (pruning specific vines) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict—balancing traumatic and gentle memories—is embodied through tactile reactions rather than diagnostic labels. However, the “informally wise intuition” trait borders on unearned insight without showing its limits or costs in action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clara’s involuntary truthfulness is embodied in sharp, character-specific dialogue (“It tastes like regret”) and drives her climactic choice to speak openly despite social cost. Her internal conflict—between routine duty and yearning for awe—is rendered through concrete perception (fogged glass, silent drones) rather than abstraction. The final renunciation of passive tallying for active wonder feels earned by her prior isolation and frustration. Minor deduction: Voss’s motives remain slightly opaque, but his function as catalyst is coherent within the story’s compressed scope.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—to understand why houses feel alive—is embodied through precise, idiosyncratic observation and action, not summary. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest via tactile engagement with displaced objects. The final choice to arrange the sanctifying circle emerges credibly from her established worldview. Cost is felt in the shift from solitary noticer to active participant in the bay’s awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fear, hope, and grief pulse through tactile details like the trailing thread and slick gloves. Her transformation from seeker to inheritor feels earned through micro-choices (kneeling, threading fingers into fissures, drinking the serum). Lumen’s “incisively kind” nature manifests not as exposition but as urgent, image-based telepathy that shapes Mara’s decisions. The final renunciation of certainty in favor of nuance carries emotional cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s grim optimism and balanced daring manifest through embodied contradictions—clutching flawed dice, calculating emotional odds, choosing rupture over possession. His final renunciation (“Let them be”) is earned by prior obsession and carries the cost of non-possession, crystallizing his understanding that loss’s texture resides in tension, not capture. The chipped die functions as both talisman and flaw, grounding motivation in tactile history. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in ozone-tasting air, brittle laughter, and fist against stone.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly embodied—her insomnia, smudged charcoal, and blurred grays reflect emotional exhaustion without therapy-speak. Mr. Voss’s restrained vulnerability (“That’s my mother”) feels earned, not expositional. Their micro-choices (offering chamomile, handing over the brush) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The final renunciation of sleep for connection carries tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly embodied—her frayed voice, flour-dusted resolve, and grief-filtered perception feel specific and consistent. Her motivation to rescue dying arts emerges through micro-choices (baking “CV,” initiating the festival) rather than declaration. The child’s question and the beekeeper’s absence create subtle pressure that reveals her hierarchy of values. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from dread to action lacks a visible misstep or hesitation that would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—defying fate through backward clocks—is vividly embodied and rooted in generational trauma. His micro-choices (rewinding the yoyo, adding mercury) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety, legacy over surrender. Internal contradiction pulses in his trembling hands versus defiant muttering. The final laugh blends triumph and terror credibly, with no diagnostic label-speak marring his emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—driven by a desire to trick fear—is compelling and rooted in her curse and near-death experience, but Vey remains underdeveloped; his cryptic role borders on functional archetype. Her interiority is vivid (“eyes like fractured glass,” tactile reactions to the clasp), yet her emotional shift at the climax lacks layered contradiction—fear resolves too cleanly into resolve. The photographically cursed trait informs her isolation but doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond setup. Final confrontation shows endurance with cost (seared skin, vanished thread), satisfying Earned Stasis, though Vey’s flat affect undermines relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Leeward’s motivation—transforming chaos into harmony—is embodied in every micro-choice, from gathering driftwood to angling the mallet. Her internal contradiction (urgency vs. precision) plays out physically, not abstractly. The final smile carries earned cost: raw fingers, aching arms, sweat-stuck hair. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in salt on lips and trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—driven by maternal legacy and intellectual obsession—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile actions (chipping the shell, clutching the journal). The final endurance (“stood her ground”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the city’s collapse and her irreversible knowledge. However, her “quietly driven” trait borders on label-only until the climax, slightly softening early agency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering distorted truth—is consistent and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict between scholarly rigor and emotional investment surfaces in embodied choices (kneeling by the rosebush, prying the *T*). Tomas’s emotionally rational demeanor contrasts effectively without flattening either character. The final renunciation of heroic myth for nuanced reconciliation is earned through prior discovery, though his backstory arrives slightly late to fully deepen their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s stoic sensitivity and archeological yearning are embodied through micro-choices—kneeling in silt, smearing ink deliberately—and her interior conflict pulses without diagnostic labels. Her discovery of the chamber forces a credible emotional shift that reconfigures her relationship to absence. The grandmother’s legacy isn’t just backstory; it alters present action and stakes. Final note-signing earns its weight through consistent motive and tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation—to trace honest origins—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (fingertips on spines, sketching grooves). Her internal contradiction (desire for order vs. confronting chaotic truth) manifests in micro-choices like pressing the stamp to her chest before using it as a key. The final renunciation of myth for “reclaimed stillness” feels earned by prior beats. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans toward lyrical abstraction (“throat tightened”) without deeper physiological specificity under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lantern maker’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, brittle laugh, and tactile ritual of polishing grief into light reveal contradiction, history, and agency. Her final confrontation with the shadow stems credibly from accumulated emotional labor, not epiphany. The origami cranes’ failure versus the lanterns’ success shows nuanced self-knowledge under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; her transformation emerges through action, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—grief-fueled pursuit of “unused potential”—is visceral, consistent, and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., slamming the console, stepping into the vortex). Her internal contradiction (desire for truth vs. self-destruction) plays out in real time without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (“Caution’s overrated”) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: loss of the observatory, her past life, and any illusion of safety. Only slight deduction for near-perfect emotional calibration under extreme stress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—her professional curiosity and personal yearning for belonging drive her actions. Her micro-choices (deploying tools, pulling the lever) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The pilgrim’s layered voice and enigmatic presence apply meaningful secondary pressure without overshadowing Lira’s agency. However, Lira’s “perpetually surprised” trait remains mostly asserted rather than embodied in consequential choices with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied through tactile details (chipped teacup, trembling watch) and his moral struggle feels authentic. His shift from memory-fabricator to truth-bearer is credibly motivated by the driftwood visions. However, Lila remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth. The final choice—rejecting his trade for truth—is earned, with clear cost in lost professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her trauma over past failure coexists with disciplined empathy. Her micro-choices (arriving early, studying the children’s details) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Elias is equally weathered but distinct in voice and posture. Their final silence speaks volumes, and Clara’s release of the pull embodies earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her pulse mirroring the compass needle, her laughter “merrily melancholic”—and her contradictions (yearning for freedom yet paralyzed by regret) drive every micro-choice. Her final renunciation of the compass feels earned through layered emotional buildup, not epiphany. The grandfather’s off-page presence exerts pressure without diluting focus. One minor slip: the ex’s dialogue borders on diagnostic (“You’re just scared”), slightly flattening his role.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied guilt (“fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water”) and micro-choices (clutching the baseball, reaching for the mother-image). Her motivation—to relearn empathy—feels urgent and rooted in her erased past. However, J.T.’s role leans slightly toward exposition; her “delicately robust” descriptor isn’t leveraged in action with visible cost. The final shift toward hope is earned but borders on abstract without a concrete renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—clinging to humanity while compelled toward metamorphosis—is embodied in tactile detail (“skin prickled as if thousands of insects crawled beneath it”) and drives every micro-choice. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering fear and resolve through sensory action (singing, applying spice-paste). The final transformation feels earned because her resistance and acceptance coexist until the last breath before change. No safety-hedging: she loses her old self even as she honors it.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—penance for her mother’s silence—is rooted in embodied trauma (the untraced hand, the cracked saucer) and intensifies through micro-choices: tracing her palm on the shift, unfastening the sash, climbing the tree. Her internal conflict—between longing and guilt—is rendered without therapy-speak, and her final renunciation (“repentance isn’t a place”) feels earned. The flaw of self-blame compels every action, and the cost (years of cloudbound isolation) is made visible in the healed saucer and new handprint. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion lives in ink-stained skin and frayed linen.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s pacifism is embodied through micro-choices (refusing weapons, stitching instead of fighting) and deepened by her quantum-engineered trait—gravitational lightness when joyful—which physically manifests inner conflict. Her epiphany (“peace is not the absence of war but the presence of courage”) emerges from specific, dramatized memories rather than abstraction. The AI functions as a pressure source, not a crutch, forcing confrontation without resolving it for her. Final renunciation of avoidance feels earned, with visible cost in the shattering locket and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, the warmth of the sand underfoot—and her motivation (to understand transformation) drives micro-choices like releasing bugs without watching them. The man’s presence sharpens her internal conflict between fixing and transforming, culminating in a credible shift toward purposeful action. However, the “destinute philanthropist” label leans slightly abstract early on, though it’s redeemed by concrete behavior. Her final renunciation of passive habit for intentional orchestration feels earned, with the cost being her old illusion of control.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kieran and Elara’s motivations are clear and rooted in consistent traits—Kieran’s quiet vigilance, Elara’s calm inventiveness—but internal contradiction is underexplored. Their micro-choices (e.g., Kieran trusting Elara with the quill holder) reveal values with visible cost. However, emotional embodiment leans slightly abstract (“motivation burned like an ember”), and their relationship functions more as plot conduit than crucible. The final descent feels earned but lacks deeper interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation is deeply rooted in her mother’s disappearance and the burden of inherited duty, intensified by her precognitive curse that fractures clarity rather than granting control. Her micro-choices—rearranging rocks into Fibonacci, Pascal’s triangle, Möbius strip—reveal a hierarchy of values: pattern over power, witness over mastery. The final renunciation (“not to control… but to witness”) is earned through escalating failures and embodied terror, with visible cost in the storm-vision and trembling hands. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile (tears mingling with salt spray) and contradictory (steadiness amid terror).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scars, mask, and breathless focus under storm pressure reveal a layered self without diagnostic labels. His motivation to rarefy poetry through raw exposure intensifies credibly from evasion to reckoning. The final act of writing and sealing the poem enacts Earned Stasis: he forecloses safety for truth, with cost legible in his aching scars and exposed vulnerability. Contradictory impulses—fury vs. tranquility, hiding vs. revealing—operate simultaneously in scene, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael and Elyra embody contradictory philosophies through precise micro-choices—Kael’s mechanical arm adapting mid-duel, Elyra disarming not to dominate but to invite evolution. Their dialogue reveals distinct worldviews without diagnostic label-speak. The cost of Kael’s lost arm grounds his motivation in tangible history. However, Elyra’s “diplomatically fierce” trait remains more asserted than dramatized in action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cedar’s molting identity and embodied contradictions—green eye dulling as gray sharpens—are rendered with specificity and emotional texture. His micro-choices (hiding the tin, sharing a poem) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Marla’s scarred knuckles and quiet request ground her allyship without sentimentality. The final renunciation—accepting chaos as growth—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her smudged window, aching fingers, and hesitation with tools reveal contradiction between desire for control and surrender to chaos. Her “strategically creative” flaw directly shapes her paralysis and eventual renunciation of planning. The final choice to descend into the hidden room feels earned through micro-choices (ignoring compasses, rolling the reel) that accumulate pressure. Cost is felt in her abandonment of surface-level performance for raw, uncalculated creation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her doubt, resolve, and fear feel specific and earned. Her micro-choice to reach into the memory pool despite luminous doubt reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The primordial storyteller functions as an extension of Lira’s psyche rather than a true second character, preserving single-POV integrity. However, the final renunciation lacks a tangible sacrifice beyond emotional labor, slightly undercutting the “visible cost” threshold for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motivation—to find “the color of what my father never said”—is emotionally specific and drives every choice, culminating in a raw, embodied apology that alters the ghost’s form. Yorick’s quiet authority emerges through micro-choices (stitching, guiding) rather than exposition. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness; their flaws (Lira’s blame, Yorick’s isolation) shape actions without safety-hedging. The final renunciation of silence carries visible cost: years lost, now irrevocably acknowledged.
