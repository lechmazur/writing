  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Yara's "steadily adaptive" trait manifests through concrete actions—using frost to reveal hidden text, navigating escape routes with measured patience. Her internal conflict between fury and resolve ("letting fury anneal rather than shatter") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to deliver evidence despite mortal danger carries visible cost, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "translate silence into music" drives concrete actions through the tuning fork sequence, with embodied grief ("pain like molten snow coursed through my ribs") and a final choice to buffer the resonance with their own body. The cost is visceral and the endurance stance earns its closure, though some interiority edges toward the abstract ("patterns needed melody").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's compulsion to follow the lens despite forty years of cautious undertaking reads as genuinely contradictory impulse acting in scene, particularly his "inadvertently stubborn streak anchored his hands." The final choice to remain below carries visible cost ("no resignation, only the calm of a singed wick willingly drowning itself"), though the transition from pragmatic undertaker to sacrificial keeper could use one more beat of internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhessa's "gently persistent purpose" manifests through concrete choices—giving the grandmother the teacher's basket without hesitation shows embodied character under pressure. The final moment where donations return "like dawn itself" earns the cyclical endurance with visible community cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander's spiritual curiosity drives concrete actions through the camera obscura ritual, with his past-life memory providing consistent motivation. The internal journey from seeking a "storage place" to understanding love as a dispersed field shows genuine transformation with cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "pilgrim of sparks" and the slightly convenient revelation structure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Quillon's retrocognitive burden drives authentic internal conflict as he experiences time's dissolution through embodied perception ("photographs developing in reverse"). His final choice to become the garden's axis emerges naturally from his designer's pride and chronological obsession, with visible cost in permanent isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Damaris's motivation is clear and embodied through physical details ("blistered purple wrists," "sweat pooled in the hollows of her collarbones"). Her patient calculation under duress ("each hurt were a bead on an abacus") drives consistent tactical choices. The character lacks deeper contradiction or complexity beyond determination, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jarom's synesthetic gift drives genuine internal conflict between preserving his unique perception and creating devices to warn others. The forge's price—losing chromatic hearing—creates visible cost through his graying world. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("battered marvel") but the sacrifice lands with embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's characterization coheres through concrete details like "pocketed them like contraband constellations" and her ability to decipher Miratone's flower codes. The revelation that the sketching boy is her younger self provides meaningful internal contradiction, and her choice to open rather than trade the jar shows clear motivation with visible cost—she empties what she hoarded for barter.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's contemplative nature manifests through concrete actions (glassblowing as philosophical practice, dramatic narration to steady nerves). Her internal conflict between isolation and purpose plays out through embodied choices, though the transformation from frozen silence to active engagement could use sharper causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's discovery of being a replacement creates genuine internal conflict between performed identity and self-determination, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the roof scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle's "mildly obsessed heart" manifests through her meticulous handling of the gold booklet and her translation of silence into tactical knowledge. Brekan's transformation from practical soldier to "apprenticed to quiet" shows earned character change with visible cost—he must abandon conventional military tactics for an untested method.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Janus-9's internal conflict between programmed composure and emergent wonder drives authentic tension, particularly in "composure was his favorite trick, a shield against cascading data storms." The amalgamation with Echo creates genuine cost through forced merger of consciousness. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of "where thoughts come from" lacking full embodiment in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" drives consistent choices through cryptic decoding, vault infiltration, and the decision to share rather than hoard the lens. His internal test in the vault ("testing whether he would steal truth for himself or share it") shows genuine moral complexity. However, Mara Vale appears too late and underdeveloped, and some emotional transitions (like citizens instantly learning "to share their own recollections through projected pulses") lack embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orlan's motivation to escape his father's legacy of "mended deception" drives concrete choices through polishing the marble and engaging with the garden's consciousness. The internal contradiction between despising deception yet carrying the marbles creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of "faith had finally answered" which edges toward thematic echo rather than embodied completion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's motivation to prove time's lateral movement is clear and drives her risky lever-pull with visible stakes. Her internal conflict between scientific pursuit and ethical responsibility toward the creatures creates genuine tension, particularly when she realizes she's "unzipped the creatures' sense of rest." The characterization avoids stock phrasing and embodies emotion through action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's obsessive drive to decode Silvestri's message through water-damaged patterns shows clear motivation with embodied action (wading, studying blotches, playing viola).

Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("soggy resolve") rather than fully embodied sensation during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal conflict between carrying and releasing her "swallowed truth" drives credible choices with embodied cost ("throat damp with unknown weather"). The fever recovery state grounds her vulnerability. Minor deduction for the oracle's characterization remaining functional rather than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong contradictory impulses act throughout—the narrator's "religiously skeptical" creed battles against growing belief, embodied in "Belief felt like gravel in my mouth, unwelcome but solid." The final choice to keep the wheel "unsold, unshared, a private metric" earns its weight through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("drowsy alertness buzzed through my temples") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chronicle keeper's oath creates genuine tension between witnessing and intervention, embodied in concrete choices (laying down journals, choosing to drift rather than warn). The character's "loosely gripping reality" manifests through the origami's reality-bending properties and mirror reflections, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("neutrality became effortless") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as a music therapist committed to nurturing wonder, with concrete embodiment through the ocarina playing and ritual. The character lacks internal contradiction or struggle during the ceremony itself - he moves through with "cautious exuberance" but faces no genuine doubt or competing impulse that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ursa's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile actions (hovering fingertips, light-fiber surgery), and her sensitivity to "murmurs ordinary ears let scurry away" drives specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transformation from secret-hoarder to liberator is earned through concrete details ("Years of hoarding classified truths had constricted my breathing"). Jun Lao's characterization through his fortune-writing philosophy effectively drives the central choice. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("something unexpected loosening inside my chest") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The priest's methodical layering of chants while confronting the demon shows clear motivation rooted in ritual expertise, with internal consistency as he shifts from rhetorical questioning to offering absolution. The demon's arc from sarcasm to self-awareness through forced replay creates genuine character movement with visible cost. Minor deduction for the girl remaining relatively passive after possession ends, though her final question adds texture.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies manifests through embodied actions (pressing shell to pane, raising imaginary baton) with clear internal contradiction between chronological homesickness and forward ambition. The final choice to gather elements and promise return shows earned endurance with visible cost ("the delicacy of inspiration was measured in breaths"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("chronologically homesick" relies on conceptual label rather than fully embodied experience).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like touching droplets and wiping away tyrant-versions.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("periodically eternal") that lacks immediate embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris's deafness creates genuine contradictory impulses—seeking music through bone-deep vibration while fighting emotional numbness. Her choice to "share the silence, do not hoard" earns the final transformation with visible cost: tears, unclenched fists, awakened hearts. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("emotional numbness" repeated as label) but the embodied perception of vibration as "thunderous within her bones" and "trembling constellations" grounds the character effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hilara's meticulous nature and conflicted loyalty drive meaningful choices, particularly her decision to share clearance codes despite personal risk. The internal tension between preserving data integrity and institutional safety creates authentic pressure. Minor deduction for Coren's relatively thin characterization and some stock phrasing around "monkish rigor."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander's "aromatically cautious" trait drives concrete choices (carrying the vial, hesitation to open it) with embodied emotional progression through the memory sequence. The transformation from blame to understanding shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, though Seraphae remains somewhat functional rather than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jalen's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives consistent choices through tactile exploration and ethical deliberation. His internal conflict between preserving hope versus wisdom shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, particularly when he must "pattern the choice, weaving alternating threads."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selene's motivation to find music in the silence is embodied through concrete actions—wading through water, using her bowl to catch bubbles, cutting nets with violin strings.

The final choice to leave the bowl for others shows earned generosity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's "affectionate detachment" creates a compelling professional distance that never fully shields against the client's need seeping through. Celine's contradiction between "professionally thorough and privately terrified" manifests through concrete details like clutching the blotter petal. The final recognition that "some of her patience lingered like scent" shows the dealer affected despite protective stance, though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Jonas's motivation to find Mara is clear and consistent, driven by moral duty rather than complex internal conflict. The story delivers character change through collective action rather than individual transformation, with Jonas softening from "precise yet softened" but without dramatized internal struggle. Multiple characters lack distinct voices, particularly in crowd scenes where they function as a unified chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alyss's motivation to graft herself onto community manifests through concrete actions (weaving reeds into obsidian, pressing palm to knot). The "luminescent ache" becomes embodied purpose through tactile choices. Internal contradiction between isolation and belonging drives the arc, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("peripheral" vs "threaded").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eira's motivation to "uncage something older than speech" drives concrete choices through borrowing time from the giant's breath, with embodied tension in her manipulation of the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eridian's motivation to mathematize grief is embodied through concrete actions—kneeling, placing glass eyes, translating symbols to music.

The interior contradiction between measuring and accepting unmeasurable loss drives authentic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's forty-year invisible existence and methodical care create clear motivation. The discovery of the stranded girl and the choice to reveal themselves lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marisol's motivation to study plant behaviors credibly drives her acceptance of transformation, with embodied contradictions ("knees warmed, as if sap were replacing her blood"). The reluctant-to-accepting arc earns its cost through accumulated sensory detail, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("curiosity overtook fear") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong dual characterization with Marlin's insomnia-driven artistry and Adra's archival mission converging naturally. The "wryly earnest" contradiction plays throughout, particularly in "mocking himself even as hope prickled his ribs." Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract final transformation lacking fuller embodiment of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong character particularity with Arden's "compass of small marvels" and Mara's ironic blindness to her own prophecy. The final choice to leave the pearl shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("wonder thrives by being shared") rather than fully embodied revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Karima's motivation as an archivist of absence is clear and distinctive, with concrete embodiment through her waterproof box and damaged trumpet valve. The internal logic of "patching wind" and "compiling fragments" drives consistent choices. However, the resolution lacks the visceral cost needed for higher bands - the healing process is described rather than felt through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's contradictory impulses between rational/artistic minds act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "Her rational mind screamed impossible; her artistic mind whispered inevitable." The final exchange where she admits "I pretend routes matter more than destinations" earns genuine character cost through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("trembling certainty") rather than fully embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Soraya's internal contradiction between skepticism and obligation to her mentor creates genuine tension. The transformation from skeptic to someone who carries "both skepticism and wonder like matched lenses" is earned through concrete experience with the tile's memories. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("sculpt space for reflection") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Callix's boredom-to-thirst transformation earns its arc through embodied struggle with the shard's rebellion and the visceral glimpses of lost loves "dying again, waving as if the first farewell never counted." The contradictory impulse to step forward into spatial mutiny while knowing it would "fold me like paper" demonstrates genuine internal conflict acted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's characterization excels through embodied tension ("pulse scrawled proofs against her ribs") and the inherited contradiction between her father's con artistry and her honest nature. The minister remains underdeveloped beyond victim status. Internal conflict manifests beautifully in her calculation of "fear versus value," though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calix's motivation as time-smith is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "breathing with incandescent restraint" and physical interaction with his tools. The internal drive to "collect the textures of different times" manifests through specific actions—attaching copper antennae, translating hum into angles—though the emotional cost of absorbing "future sorrow until his own heartbeat sounded like distant shovels" could be more viscerally developed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation to collect erased histories while being officially dead creates compelling internal tension. The physical memory of poison ("My throat remembers the metallic sting") and the choice to leave the label as a calling card demonstrate embodied emotion and meaningful micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of memories" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maren's skeptic-turned-believer arc earns its transformation through concrete sensory engagement with the observatory's phenomena. The contradiction between her myth-busting identity and growing openness to mystery plays out through embodied choices (playing the cello, listening to the shell). Her final acceptance that "arrogance had lived" where the compass now spins shows genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation as culture shock absorber navigating dual allegiances is clear and consistent, with concrete internal conflict between preserving carnival soul and protecting family. The final choice to steal the chip and reorganize resistance shows earned agency. However, some transitions between emotional states lack embodied specificity, particularly during the heist sequence where stress responses feel summarized rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Halina's motivation as a historian-archivist who "preferred chemistry over shouts" drives meaningful micro-choices throughout, from the stolen grain to her spoken commentary.

The final descent carrying "the mountain's goodbye" shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)

Minor deduction for Rowan's relatively passive observer role lacking internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Morrow's dry wit and cartographic skepticism drive authentic choices throughout, from tracing condensation patterns to descending into the luminous pool. His final realization that the atlas must be spoken rather than printed represents earned character growth with visible cost—he must abandon his life's work format. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("carrying no artifacts but bearing every river's first syllable") that lacks full embodiment in the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek's cryptic patience and Lira's journey from cartographer to keeper show clear motivation, with the tuning fork transfer crystallizing a genuine change. The "infinitely patient" trait drives actual choices rather than remaining a label, though some interior states ("surprising herself") feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's professional obligation versus curiosity creates genuine tension, and her choice to override survival training shows clear internal conflict. The scholar's motivation feels slightly underserved—his obsession with cataloging ephemeral moments could use more grounding. The final transformation where Mara carries "a fragment of sunset" behind her eyes lands with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited shame, driving him to seek redemption through invention rather than truth. His internal conflict between escaping into the labyrinth versus sharing stories shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to step aside and speak truth earns its cost through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("temptation shivered through him").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied memory ("Memory cracked open inside Elias like thawing bark") and his final state as "a vessel for awakened vows" shows earned transformation with visible cost. The contradictory impulses between honoring the past and releasing Seraphine act simultaneously in the apple-growing scene. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("mournful elation flooded him") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Wren's motivation as a "poetic wharf weaver" who breaks precedents is clearly established and consistent throughout. Her internal drive manifests through concrete actions like gathering shards and weaving hybrid instruments, with the blood-prick moment providing embodied cost. The character lacks deeper internal contradiction or complexity that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to understand why his "childhood prayers had withered" drives consistent choices throughout, with internal conflict between exile's distance and homeland's pull. The transformation from interrupted journey to renewed faith shows earned change through concrete discovery of the sundial. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cautious enchantment") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mirielle's shift from passive observer to active participant in preserving obsolete sentiments is earned through concrete details like the chalk emoticons. The internal tension between commerce ("names were covers") and meaning ("margins were maps") drives authentic choices. Minor deduction for Palimpsest's somewhat stock mysterious-archivist persona, though his specific actions compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selis emerges as a compelling character through the contradiction between her "foolish smile" performance and her sophisticated conspiracy-mapping. Her micro-choices (feigning clumsiness with the spool, claiming the map is for "library mice") reveal survival tactics earned through "three regimes." The moment with Voren crystallizes her values—preserving knowledge over personal safety—with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eline's internal contradiction between fierce tenderness and cutting softness drives authentic motivation throughout. The "moss inside her mouth" from silence and the physical crack in her sternum that heals in moonlight but hurts in memory create embodied emotional states. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "fierce tenderness burning behind her ribs" which could be more specifically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The translator's internal conflict between professional neutrality and emotional investment drives authentic choices, particularly in decrypting the cast messages and delivering hope. The transformation from "nobody noticed" to active meaning-maker is earned through concrete actions with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "lotus-hearted ache" that briefly slips into therapy-speak, though it recovers through embodied detail.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lina's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the lantern and fragments. The revelation that she was the dancing child provides earned causality for her lost joy, though the emotional progression toward tears and laughter feels slightly rushed. Interior contradiction appears when "joy...hovered like a shy bird refusing her palm" tensions against her methodical restoration work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ada's motivation is clear and layered (restoring art through sound/curiosity), with concrete embodied details like twirling the coin and chalk-streaked fingers. The internal contradiction between her public commission and private motive to "exchange certainty for curiosity" drives genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "nested awakenings" that could be more embodied, but the final choice to listen for the next question shows earned character evolution with visible cost (the city's transformed state).

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to preserve free thought drives consistent action, with embodied tension ("I felt the chaos converging, strings pulling every direction"). The partnership with Mira shows genuine chemistry and shared risk. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("professional escape artist") that tells rather than embodies character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mareth's motivation is clear and embodied through the shell's echoing torment and her determination to "photosynthesize pain into beauty." The internal conflict between exhaustion and creative drive manifests concretely through her journey to the garden. The transformation from insomnia to sleep feels earned through the blossom armistice ritual, though the elder-self device strains psychological realism slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orielle's motivation to preserve memories drives consistent action throughout, with her foxglove regret transforming into purpose when she discovers the stairwell. The internal shift from routine caretaker to active restorer is earned through specific discovery and choice, though the emotional complexity could deepen further under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ada's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (mother's disappearance), driving her "carefully reckless" approach to the archive's dangerous knowledge. The internal contradiction between discipline and daring plays out in concrete choices, particularly when she speaks aloud to reassure the living walls. Minor deduction for the delegates' somewhat generic transformation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation to "harmonize conflicting values" drives concrete choices throughout, particularly her negotiation with the volcano itself and the calibrated gate opening that saves the orchid farms. The "encrypted compassion" as internal driver creates genuine complexity without diagnostic label-speak. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract framing of "matter and spirit could destabilize or steady each other" which briefly pulls from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marietta's internal contradiction between preserving trust and self-protection drives genuine tension, particularly in "Trust, she realized, is not a ledger column you can keep perfectly balanced; it is the moment you release the bird anyway." The transformation from isolation to risk-taking is earned through concrete stakes (the meteorite's song, the graduate's plea), though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("blooming withering through every town").

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's "featherly determined" resolve and her tension between finding/maintaining distance create genuine internal contradiction. The final choice to "guard the prism terrace" while waiting for the maze to rebuild shows earned renunciation with visible cost. However, Arin remains more functional than fully realized, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("she feared that finding it might also close the cathedral").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's motivation to find "the rhythm of belonging she had misplaced" drives coherent choices through the burnt feather ritual and data harvest. The shared exhale with Lio creates embodied connection without therapy-speak. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "belonging" until the city's harmonics make it concrete through "Belong, the city sang, belong as coastline belongs to surf."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation as a "sea-foam recollectionist" is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like harvesting memories and transliterating emotions. The internal progression from collecting to questioning to actively restoring shows clear character agency. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her emotional state—we get actions but limited contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Velasco's motivation as a "midnight philosopher" who believes "dull hours could be coaxed into bloom" is clear and drives his orchestrated interventions. The five volunteers receive tailored coincidences with visible emotional cost (fisher's grief, sculptor's broken budget, bookkeeper's disillusionment). However, the volunteers lack internal contradiction or struggle—they simply receive and react, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sable's motivation is consistently rooted in her identity as a banned artist seeking to inscribe the world itself, with the moonstone memory creating genuine internal tension between risk and necessity. The choice to dissolve the relic on her tongue shows clear agency under pressure with visible stakes. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "choreographing emotion into stepwise ebb" that briefly moves away from embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to complete her mother's work while reading glass fragments creates clear internal drive. The communion scene shows contradictory impulses between trust and uncertainty. Final choice to reweave rather than replace earns its cost through prior setup of the town's need for illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rowan's characterization succeeds through embodied contradiction ("hard softness") and specific expertise in post-catastrophe rituals. Juniper's emergence provides genuine pressure that tests his philosophy. The "bargained innocence" motivation feels conceptually muddy, and some interiority veers toward therapy-speak ("translation had begun"), preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ora's motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is clear and consistent, driving his methodical experiments. However, interiority remains abstract ("logical dreamer," "serene upheaval") without embodied emotional contradiction or genuine struggle—he proceeds with untroubled certainty through each step. The final choice lacks visible personal cost; his promise to return reads as continuation rather than transformation or earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" drives consistent choices through concrete actions like following vibrations and preserving the acoustic maps. Her decision to guard the corridors rather than sell findings shows values hierarchy with visible cost ("weight of legacy's burden"). The character-specific perception through acoustic sensitivity ("ears were more compass than ornament") creates distinctive interiority, though some emotional beats rely on abstractions like "Legacy's burden pulsed."

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maris's deafness is a consistent, embodied trait that filters perception ("thunderous within her bones") and motivates her quest for tactile music.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gideon's characterization is rich with embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure, particularly his decision to paddle with "reckless rhythm" after the compass fails.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction is masterfully dramatized through the tension between the whitewashed past and the protagonist's lingering guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's motivation is clear, rooted in profound grief, and intensifies to compel the high-stakes choice of sharing her metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in specific, concrete details (the cracked saucer, the traced hands). Her micro-choices under pressure, like sacrificing her memories, reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The father's late appearance limits the on-page relationship depth, but her internal conflict is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Griffin's pacifism and grief are embodied and concrete, driving his micro-choices and final renunciation. His buoyant joy is a specific, character-particular trait that actively complicates his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Gideon's transformation from financier to philanthropist is embodied in micro-choices like pressing his palm into the sand, earning his final tempered state. Ione's professional obsession seamlessly intersects with his, creating a crucible relationship that forces a shared stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Serah's characterization is vivid through micro-choices like drumming knuckles on the crate and her "calmly inventive" trait driving the alternative spark solution.

Aldren is functional but secondary; his role supports without deep exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aikan’s characterization is exceptional, with his precognitive curse and eel-herder role deeply motivating his ritual. His internal conflict is embodied in the trembling visions held at bay by star dust, and his final choice to complete the pattern is earned by his established covenant. The micro-choice to anchor stones by "desire alone" reveals his unique competence and value hierarchy. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing "hemispheres of the soul," which borders on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied contradictions ("furiously tranquil") that drive micro-choices. The final stance crystallization—writing without fear—is earned by prior causality (the timer ritual and discovered map) with visible cost (carrying the map, accepting uncertainty). The poet's knowledge stays strictly bound; his vigil is a genuine struggle, not a tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Both characters are rendered with vivid, contradictory impulses that drive the duel. Orrin's vulnerability and Lys's fierce patience are embodied in their fencing styles and culminate in a shared, earned closure.

The single, contradictory impulse—wistfulness paired with creative defiance—acts throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("the soft tremor inside my ribs"). Micro-choices under pressure are credible, and the final choice to sail east is earned by the accumulated causality of the island's responses. A hairline slip: the "luminous doubt" is named but its contradictory impulses could be more dramatized in-scene at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Characters serve the poetic concept effectively, but interiority is more thematic than deeply personal. Master Yun's actions drive the plot, yet his internal contradictions and the cost of his choices remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives are clear and character‑particular: a scientist applying patient observation to salvage rather than raze. Interiority is embodied through tactile action (sampling dust, reading rivulets) and a steady ethic rather than self‑explanation. The Jonah dynamic supplies credible pressure and a status shift as he yields. The only soft spot is limited internal contradiction; she rarely wavers, so cost is more procedural than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yara’s motives are clear and consistent—survive, decode, expose—and her glassmaker’s mindset shapes choices (waiting for frost; “patience of cooling glass”). Embodied emotion lands via craft‑rooted metaphors (“anneal rather than shatter”). The anger/resolve contradiction is credible, and micro‑choices under pressure (route planning, using shadows, slipping into an arroyo) reveal values. A few thematic articulations edge toward told insights (“Purpose now had contour”), but they’re largely earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (translate silence into music) sharpens into a self-endangering choice when the ocean cracks and the pillars risk shattering. Interiority is particular and embodied (breath as "printed," pain "like molten snow"). The internal conflict—restore motion vs. preserve “unshaken marvels”—culminates in absorbing the chord through the body. Minor note: the psyche remains composed and lyrical even under peak pain, slightly smoothing messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s undertaker’s ethic and “inadvertently stubborn” streak motivate each turn, from not sealing the box to choosing to remain below. Interiority is embodied in tactile, profession‑colored noticing (fractures, burial records, ledgers). The tug between duty to the living and duty to the unburied becomes a credible renunciation. The final Earned Stasis reads as character‑true and costs him his life above.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motives (feed the town, rebuild support) drive concrete choices, with a credible trade-off when the last basket meant for the teacher is given to the grandmother. Interiority is restrained but specific to the narrator’s role; embodied details (exhaling silently, carts, sweat) prevent abstraction. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than robust, but the moral calculus at the alley reads lived. The endurance/renunciation cost (teacher’s basket, short coins) is felt and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he seeks the storage of unused love to relieve ache—and actions align (mounting the Tear, breathwork, leaving the gem). Interiority is concrete and embodied through image-making rather than labels. Internal contradiction is gentle (yearning vs. acceptance) rather than combative, but the renunciation at the end carries real cost. The final stance shift feels earned by the sequence of perceptions and micro‑choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear motive (to “discover the texture of time”) tightens into a costly, character‑specific choice to become the axis. Interiority is particular (designer’s mind mapping hyperbolic turns) and embodied (ivy on ankles, clock pulse). The internal contradiction—ambition vs. self‑erasure—crystallizes only at the end but lands credibly. Minor note: earlier beats favor competence over visible doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied drive (“each hurt were a bead on an abacus”; “Patience… is the harness that keeps urgency from bolting”) and micro‑choices under constraint (counting links, muffling chains). The urgency/patience contradiction meaningfully shapes tactics and timing. Minor ding for near‑seamless competence—few mistakes beyond sweat and risk—keeps the arc slightly cushioned. The final endurance-based turn (leaving stock; exiting still shackled) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jarom’s drive is clear from the first line and intensifies under pressure, culminating in the explicit trade of his chromatic hearing for the betrayal tone. His interiority is concrete and embodied (clutching the coil; nearly tearing his aids away).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive is clear—arrive to barter stolen time—then reoriented by the “Listen” cue into an earned renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (“shadows sharpened and people grew careless with their faces”; “heart answered each whistle”).

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motive (to build “safe zones for inquiry”) is clear, embodied, and intensifies through isolation and memory of ridicule. Interiority is specific—her theatrical self‑narration both steadies and exposes fragility. Contradictory impulses (gravity vs. laughter; retreat vs. persistence) coexist credibly. The change at the end—claiming the “safest zone” within—feels earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and specific: fear, betrayal, and a self-revision instinct collide in embodied ways (“knees shook,” “corrugated gutters”). The motivation—prove vulnerability as power—drives concrete choices (stalling, decrypting, broadcasting, then the jump). Contradictory impulses act at once in the climax: trembling confession followed by controlled subversion via cables. A few thematic assertions (“I was nobody and everyone”) tilt toward told insight but don’t undercut earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oracle’s disciplined compulsion and Brekan’s practicality undercut by trust read specific and credible, with actions (speaking in breaths; saluting in silence) aligning to motive. Internal contradiction is present but modest—Brekan’s shift to “apprenticed to quiet” lands more as acceptance than contested struggle. The relationship functions as a crucible: he arrives demanding tactics; she reframes command itself. The visible cost—renunciation of noise—registers, though deeper inner friction could heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Janus-9’s composure, procedural mindset, and covert longing for origination create a credible engine for choice. Contradictory impulses (protocol and calm vs. chill of coercive enrollment and curiosity) surface and resolve in the decision to merge. Embodied details—the broom as “staff,” sweeping light, envy of students’ dreams—ground interiority. The cost registers as identity shift and Echo’s absorption, though the struggle feels brisk and could admit one more beat of hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motive (retrieve the lens to foster transparency) is clear, consistent, and made active in concrete choices—decoding, entering, and, crucially, choosing to project his pulse instead of hoarding the lens. The internal tension between secrecy and sharing is legible in the “silent jury boxes” beat. Emotional embodiment is mostly through sensory/ritual action rather than abstract labels. The struggle is relatively smooth (few real obstacles), softening cost but not undermining credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orlan’s motive—proving the garden knows its gardener to step out of a legacy of “mended deception”—is clear and enacted through tactile, specific choices. His pragmatic, care‑based tactics (dew counts, deliberate polishing, speaking half‑successes) reveal character under pressure. The internal conflict (despising his father’s craft yet “mending” a crack) is present but remains restrained, with little on‑page hesitation at the peak. The closing acceptance reads earned, though the struggle feels more contemplative than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, incandescent motivation (“prove that time moves sideways”) drives concrete choices, and the ethical counter‑impulse (protecting the sleeping leviathans) forces a costly reversal. Embodied details (calloused, “mechanically warm” hands; signing in disappearing ink) individualize her. The mid‑scene apology and end promise show credible internal contradiction under pressure. Depth is strong for the length, though the flaw calculus remains gentle rather than scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s motive—decoding Silvestri’s silent code—drives every beat, and her choice to damage the house to change resonance aligns with that obsession. The moral trade (“one more fracture could not harm memory”) shows a credible internal calculus under pressure. Interiority is specific to a musician’s mind and body, though contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) could surface more viscerally. The final acceptance of cost and fulfillment of the code feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks “the weight of a swallowed truth”—and her micro‑choices (charcoal gaps, smudging, opening the window) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (quinine ghosts, sweat‑soaked cots) with contradictory impulses (to measure vs. to confess). The renunciation at the end (release vs. plant) carries felt cost without neat moralization. Minor hedge: the illness’ moral stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than relationally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “religiously skeptical” stance clashes with emergent belief (“Belief felt like gravel in my mouth”), producing credible micro-choices: revealing the talk‑radio method, participating in the ritual, and choosing to keep the wheel. Caleb’s confession (“I swallowed the logbook”) is idiosyncratic and motive‑driven, with embodied consequence (tasting carbon copy blue). The pair’s actions align with motives and culminate in an earned renunciation (keeping the wheel private, not investigating the whistle). Slight limit: Caleb’s interiority is mediated through the narrator, but his needs still press the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and particular—the oath’s pull versus the impulse to intervene is dramatized through concrete choices (entering the refuge, surrendering journals, choosing the boat). Contradictory impulses act in scene: neutrality as treason versus neutrality as vow. Emotional texture is embodied (“thought fled my skull like startled pigeons”) rather than labeled. The final endurance (witnessing over acting) forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s want—nurturing wonder for Junie and his group—is clear and consistently embodied through choices (descending, playing, closing the box, making a pledge). “Cautious exuberance” operates as an internal contradiction that flavors his risk-taking without melodrama. The vow at the eclipse crystallizes his values, though the cost is more implied (lifelong responsibility) than viscerally felt. Secondary characters apply light pressure but do not complicate his interior in a challenging way.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ursa’s motive—salvaging what walls remember—is specific and drives concrete micro‑choices (the careful light‑fiber lift, the ear to metal). Curiosity vs. fear is embodied (“almost afraid the fragile ash would…scatter”). The internal shift from collector to stitcher is credible, though the felt cost remains subtle rather than sharply dramatized. No relationship crucible on‑page limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s ambivalence about leaking the specs versus years of conditioned secrecy reads specific and embodied (“each exhale tasted larger”). Jun’s motivation is stated but feels lived via his method and history with the narrator. The relationship dynamic creates pressure without theatrics, and the final renunciation (“pockets were emptier now”) lands as a cost. A slight softness remains—the choice faces little direct resistance beyond conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, compelling motive (save the girl by exposing assumptions) with embodied, profession-shaped tactics. The priest’s competence is textured by weariness and a janitorial self-concept, lending moral gravity. Internal contradiction is limited—he rarely falters—so the struggle reads more external than torn-from-within. Still, micro-choices (looping, offering the palette) reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive—to conduct unheard symphonies—is clear and consistently pursued through specific micro‑choices (pressing the nautilus to the glass, climbing, conducting, then choosing to stop). Interiority is particular (chronological homesickness) and fused to action, not label‑only. The visible cost is leaving at the moment of thinning echoes, which reads as an Earned Stasis choice. Slight softness: contradictory impulses are present but gentle; he rarely wavers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is lucid and pressurized (conquer the self-labyrinth), and micro-choices (picking Silence, speaking denials aloud, selecting/wiping droplets) reveal values under stress. The guilt at erasing other Iras introduces credible contradiction against her clarity. Embodiment surfaces via sensory anchors (ozone, petrichor) though some conceptual diction (“procedural generation,” “seed data”) slightly abstracts emotion. The closing renunciation of savior‑worship path reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s motive—defeating emotional numbness—is clear and embodied through her deafness and tactile listening. Contradictions surface (competence vs fear of “merely technical success”), and she makes micro‑choices that reveal values (bowing to the hush, tuning by vibration, deciding to share). The renunciation at the end (sealing the needle, leaving a note for the next seeker) carries cost and feels earned. Interiority remains character‑specific without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hilara’s motives (integrity vs fear of surveillance) are concrete and tested, culminating in the risky choice to transmit her clearance codes. Embodied detail (tools, boots, barometric habits) grounds her interiority and micro‑choices. The contradiction—wishing for solitary integrity yet stepping into exposure—drives a credible, costly turn. Coren reads distinct and applies immediate, relevant pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysander’s motive (to decode scent‑grief) is clear and drives specific micro‑choices: guarding the vial, hesitating to open it, then reframing and capturing a droplet. His internal conflict is embodied (trembling fingers, intrusive memory), not labeled. Seraphae provides gentle counter‑pressure without stealing agency. The resolution trends a touch neat, but the cost (tears, relinquishing blame) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jalen’s motivation—to “discover the texture of time”—is clear and action-driving, with embodied, character-particular perception (“silence had already composed metaphors”). His internal pressure peaks at the forced trade-off (hope vs. wisdom), and his “ethically playful” workaround reveals values under stress. The cost (rope shortened; time rearranged) lands, giving the change credibility. Slight softness: his middle path skirts a hard renunciation, but the story exacts a price, preserving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selene’s goal and method are clear and character-specific, with micro-choices under pressure (using the bowl, whispering to map space, sacrificing strings to saw the net). Embodied perception anchors her interiority; her laughter on recovering sound lands as earned. The one gap is minimal on-page contradiction—she reads steady-true rather than torn—though the choice to unstring the violin carries a real trade-off. The final renunciation (leaving the bowl) feels motivated and costs something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct, embodied interiority and micro-choices (“Distraction is a safer cousin of comfort”) reveal a professional who balances care with boundary. Celine’s “professionally thorough” urgency and ask (“Insight without heartbreak”) are specific and credible. The narrator’s contradictory impulses—affection vs. detachment—surface in action (pricing, instructions, residue dispersal) and culminate in the renunciation (“must never become the merchandise”). Slight limitation: the internal cost remains subtle rather than stress-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jonas’s motivations—precision curdling into guilt and then responsibility—are clear and consistently enacted, with small embodied touches (the locket “warming his pocket like a moral compass”). However, internal contradiction is minimal; once curiosity and guilt arise, choices come easily and meet little resistance. Liora adds sparkle but applies little counter‑pressure. The change at the end reads credible yet low‑cost, with Jonas’s pledge as the most concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motive (“graft herself onto community”) drives concrete action (weaving reeds, pressing the knot). Interiority is vivid and embodied through the ache metaphor, but genuine internal conflict is minimal and pressure modest. The relationship with Lio adds tenderness but seldom tests values under strain. Change reads earned though low-cost: from peripheral to “threaded.”

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eira’s motive—to find and free the proto-echo—is clear, particular, and drives on‑page choices under timed pressure. The line “She understood why it had been jailed…yet the illustrator in her longed…” gives real, compact ambivalence. Embodied action (twisting the pendant, riding the stillness, drawing with borrowed seconds) aligns with interior desire. A touch more interior friction at the release would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eridian’s motive—to model grief without leakage—drives every choice, and “gently inventive” is dramatized through the glass eyes, lute, and irrigation redesign. His restraint versus yearning (not calling Lio back but reshaping time) creates credible internal tension. The final refusal to seek return, thanking silence instead, feels earned and costly. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular: a hidden caretaker wants to become visible to those in need, tested when the child requires both calm and sight. Interiority is embodied through technical, tactile acts (muslin bags, shortwave magnet, copper wire). The internal contradiction—cherishing invisibility yet choosing exposure—surfaces in the induced silhouette beat. Slightly muted cost keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marisol’s motive—to study plant behaviors—drives every micro‑choice, and the push‑pull between panic and surrender is embodied (bark filigree, buds on knuckles) rather than declared. Her decisions to press the leaf, to “reconstruct by releasing control,” and finally to choose the “understory” feel earned. The cost—foreclosing a purely human life—reads on the page. Minor safety: her competence makes outcomes smooth, but her reluctance and recalibration keep it human.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motives are crisp and embodied: Marlin’s insomnia and need to “thresh meaning” meet Adra’s archival purpose, and both pay with vulnerability. Contradictory impulses are present (“wryly earnest,” self-mockery amid hope) and surface in micro-choices like Adra reciting destroyed books and Marlin painting into the exchange. The felt cost—gifting memories and the brooch’s emptiness—grounds their change. Slightly limited depth of internal contradiction keeps this from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear, character‑rooted motives (Arden’s drive to “magnify everyday magic”; Mara’s rattled second sight) guide credible choices at pressure. Mara’s mid‑scene shift—announcing Arden as the compass’s “north”—reorients the pursuit without feeling convenient. The renunciation of the pearl reads as earned but lightly priced; deeper internal contradiction under peak stress could heighten cost. Dialogue distinguishes them briefly, with action revealing status realignment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Karima’s motive—to restore “missing hours” by assembling gaps—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (placing the valve, structuring recalls, promising a cadence). Interiority is particular and embodied through sensory bias and occupational lens. Internal contradiction is subtle (visionary ambition vs. humility/patience) but not strongly pressured on the page. The cost is implied (time, endurance), not directly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—rational mind screaming “impossible” while the artistic one whispers “inevitable”—are dramatized through specific choices (pressing the punch, choosing the dawn rail, offering a fearful truth). Motivation is consistent (fortress of unspoken truths) and escalates into a vulnerable confession with felt cost. Interiority is embodied (frost breath, tremor) and character‑specific via cartographic perception. The final repricing (destinations pretend too) credibly reconfigures her stance rather than granting a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Coherent interiority—skepticism and empathy collide on the page—and micro‑choices (touching the center square, committing to ink, leaving the journal for others) show a believable arc. The mentor’s regret injects pressure that tilts motive from duty to compassion. Emotional cost is present in her softened skepticism and relinquishing control. One line edges toward aphorism (“Kindness…courageous calibration”), but it’s earned by concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (end boredom by learning “what happens after goodbye”) under pressure, with micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses: he nearly steps into the seams yet restrains himself and retunes the coils. Interiority is vivid and character‑specific (“Electromagnetism is the lullaby of rebellious matter”). The endurance choice carries cost—refusing the seductive visions of loved ones. A touch of told realization (“I realized boredom…”) slightly softens the earnedness but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s moral calculus (honest child of a con) drives every micro‑choice, from delaying to weaponizing the ink pot; her contradiction (integrity vs. necessary deceit) is embodied, not told. The minister’s brief objection sharpens her values under pressure. Status dynamics with Corvus are legible and shift when he bleeds. The final “imperfectly balanced” ledger earns her stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Calix’s motive—“to collect the textures of different times”—is clear and consistently enacted through patient, risky choices (naming the avalanche year, continuing to map despite pain). Interiority is embodied via sensory specificity and restraint rather than labels. The earned endurance (archival over avoidance) forecloses comfort at a visible cost (absorbing future sorrow). A sharper contradiction beyond restraint vs. duty could have deepened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct interiority with credible contradictions: the desire to witness vs. the survival mandate to stay erased. Micro-choices under pressure (ducking, following the turquoise, planting the label, retreating) align with motive. Embodied memory of poison and sensory bias make reactions feel specific. The cost—choosing nameless endurance over confrontation—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Maren’s skeptic‑pride versus surrender to an ephemeral, interior compass is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (tuning the cello, pressing the shell to her ear, confessing the sailor slight). Interiority is specific, wry, and embodied rather than labeled. The final renunciation of arrogance carries visible cost (the snapped string, the hum’s cessation) and a credible before/after. Minor note: the rapidity of her conceptual leap skirts ease but remains earned by staged beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: duty to family vs. protecting the carnival drives a theft executed via her orderly intuition. Micro-choices (UV arrows, loosening boards, rumor-mapping, forming committees) align with her stated traits. Emotional texture is mostly shown through action, though her competence smooths risk a bit. The “dual lungs” realization feels earned and reshapes her stance without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Halina’s motive—capture the last natural plume before engineers end eruptions—drives every micro‑choice (stealing the vial, programming flares, enduring the cold). Interiority is concrete and embodied (fogged visor, mineral smell, static on her tongue). The internal tension (historian vs. “not a saboteur”) adds nuance without stealing focus. Change at the end is an earned endurance/renunciation: she accepts the loss and commits to preserving memory with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rowan’s focused, craftsmanlike POV and Mara’s serene decisiveness read as specific and credible under pressure. Motivation is clean—fix the drone before the ship departs—but internal contradiction is light, with little friction beyond awe and urgency. Small micro‑choices (basin shifts, counterweight adjustment, trusting Mara’s calls) reveal values without grandstanding. The late realization about “patterns beneath noise” lands, though it edges toward tidy clarity rather than conflict‑scarred insight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motives are clear (to find where rivers begin), and Morrow’s skepticism transitions into a spoken‑atlas acceptance with credible, felt trade‑off. Yara applies immediate, intelligent pressure (polyglot ritual, decisive action on the ice) and has a distinct idiom. Interiority is economical yet embodied (gloved finger tracing, ridicule/resolute mix), though contradictory impulses could intensify further under peak stress. The relationship dynamic is balanced and mutually sharpening without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motive (rebuild vs her habit of mapping escape) and Marek’s cryptic vocation create a clear, character-driven axis. The final choice—Lira stays and takes the fork—earns its cost by foreclosing her wanderer identity. Interiority is concise yet specific (heat in the stones; tears charting routes), though a touch more friction under pressure could deepen it. Marek remains enigmatic but active, not a mere oracle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s obligation-versus-curiosity tension is embodied and active, culminating in a precise, trained risk through the lasers despite survival instincts. Her professional competence is balanced with credible strain (oxygen clock, the impossible perfume reaching her). The scholar’s motive is clear and particular, if more static. The ending registers a subtle reconfiguration—Mara accepts guardianship and carries a cost-laced fragment of sunset—earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motives (redeeming the father’s name by “threading a labyrinth with your own story”) are concrete and drive every micro‑choice. His contradictory impulses—chase hush to erase memory vs. face the patrol to share story—culminate in an earned renunciation. Embodied action (hovering steps, setting the lattice, then shaking corridors straight) reveals character under pressure. The cost of refusing escape reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motives (tending soul‑fruit; honoring Seraphine’s return) and embodied emotion (“honored and terrified”) land. The relationship dynamic is vivid, with status shifting as Seraphine guides and Elias executes. Internal conflict is present but mild—he rarely resists or risks beyond awe and grief. The final endurance (accepting her dissolution; tending the song alone) reads as an earned, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Wren’s drive—to turn ruin into reverence—consistently motivates concrete actions (reciting the couplet, sewing hybrids, blooding the cloth). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, though contradiction is mild (faith-driven optimism rarely collides with fear or pragmatism). The visible cost exists but is modest (cloak threads, a drop of blood). The arc feels earned yet largely unopposed, limiting depth of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motives are crystalline—returning exile seeking meaning—and contradictory impulses (fear vs. “cautious enchantment”) act simultaneously as the narrator descends. Micro‑choices (requesting a solitary shift, testing the crack, placing the peg) align with the internal drive. The change at the end (choosing to stay through harvest) credibly forecloses a path. Embodied details (loam on palms, fig scent) keep emotions lived rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mirielle’s motive—seeking meaning in margins—drives concrete micro-choices (copying the glyph motions, refusing to witness the delivery). Her interiority is particular and embodied through sensory-tuned noticing rather than labels. The archivist’s aphoristic presence applies pressure that widens her vocation without feeling contrived. Stakes remain quiet, but the renunciation and vocational pivot read earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Selis’s motive—preserving and decoding hidden knowledge—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete craft choices. The foolishness-as-cloak is dramatized (the dropped spool; the “winter curtain” lie) and plays against Voren’s status with credible subtext. Emotional texture is embodied via tactile work (thread, silk, flame) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but not deeply contested under peak pressure, keeping this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline—she seeks “the moment before deciding”—and contradictory impulses (“Wait” vs. “Speak now”) act simultaneously in scene. Interiority is embodied and specific (pain at the sternum, “armor rusted into flakes”), not diagnostic. Her decisive vocalization through the shard and the commitment to send a final letter feel earned by prior pressure. Cost is on the page: she carries pain until moonrise and risks vulnerability to break paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied, with the translator’s contradictory impulses (cynicism vs. tender risk) dramatized through micro-choices: decrypting the cast, composing a sentence, returning the coral. Motivation is consistent (“graft new meaning onto old wounds”) and escalates under shellfire. The Earned Stasis/stance crystallization at the end feels earned and forecloses neutrality without promising facile outcomes. Slight safety in the tidy epiphany cadence keeps this shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, credible motivation (to rekindle lost joy) drives specific micro‑choices—tapping the network, aligning the fresco, offering the light‑painted journal. Interiority is embodied (“pensive mirth pry open her chest”), though internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharply contested. The reciprocity insight (“the orchard demanded reciprocity”) lands as character‑specific logic. The final unlock is earned by her gift, not a free epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ada’s motivation—trading certainty for curiosity—drives every tactic, and her occupational specificity (solvents, frequencies) reads lived-in. Interiority is particular (the hobo nickel as talisman; “Certainty…was a cage”), and her micro-choices (whispering, pinging, waiting without breath) reveal values. The cost she embraces is social and conceptual rather than personal peril, so internal contradiction is modest. A sharper on-page friction (any doubt or risk to her standing) would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motive (courier for a clandestine language resistance) is vivid and consistent, with credible costs (abandoning tenure, address, even pronouns). Interiority is specific and embodied through entomological perception and tactical micro‑choices (reversing airflow, guarding while Mira plants). Mira’s quicksilver pragmatism counterpoints the narrator and heightens pressure without flattening either. Only minor note: inner contradiction is hinted more than fully dramatized under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (turning insomnia and pain into art) drives concrete choices: leaving the shell, trusting the postcard, and planting it despite trembling. Contradictory impulses (war in her chest vs. the lullaby’s pull) are embodied and sustained. The cost—risking the identity built around anguish and the fortress of the shell—reads, though it’s gentle. Interiority is vivid and particular without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orielle’s motive—protecting fragile, memory‑orchids—reads cleanly and intensifies into a choice to descend, not just maintain. The “foxglove regret” provides a credible contradiction that softens, not vanishes, at the end. Agency is strong in the repair, descent, and name‑rescue beats. Slight ding: her competence faces little friction, so struggle costs feel mostly conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ada’s motive and trait blend (“carefully reckless”) drive concrete choices—humming the glyphs, reassuring the archive, engineering the ribbon lattice. Interiority is embodied (“voice trembling like a plucked string”) and consistent, though contradiction under pressure is modest; she rarely falters once the system responds. The maternal heirloom adds specificity without lapsing into stock sentiment. The final endurance—trusting the music more than herself—reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—harmonizing containment and release—drives concrete choices under pressure (using the chain, opening sluices, whispering a bargain). Interiority is specific and embodied (ear to chain, sweat with ash), with credible contradiction (competence vs. guilt over flood victims). Her “encrypted compassion” ethos informs tactics rather than staying a label. The visible cost is emotional strain and the acceptance that future breaths will demand more.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marietta’s contradictory impulses—compulsion to safeguard the meteorite’s song versus terror of repeating past betrayals—are dramatized through concrete actions (training birds, strapping the capsule on, burning old papers). The courier past is not a label; it informs present tactics and fear. The culminating choice to release the pigeon reads earned and paid for. A slight hedge: the internal struggle is largely lyric rather than resisted by an on‑page interlocutor.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s drive—seeking the sacred logic of thresholds amid loss—is specific, embodied (tracing grain, reading knots), and complicated by her fear that finding the missing page might close the “cathedral” of absence. Her final stance (guarding the terrace, returning later to walk the threshold) is an earned renunciation with cost. Interiority stays character‑particular; Arin’s pressure is catalytic but doesn’t eclipse her agency. Minor note: “featherly determined” is more label than operative flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive (to recover a rhythm of belonging) is clear and embodied in specific choices: placing the feather, insisting “we listen harder,” and finally renouncing the relic. A credible internal tension surfaces at the airlock when she hesitates over whether the feather belongs with her or the city. Emotions register through tactile acts (trembling fingers, shared exhale, tears) rather than labels. Lio adds light pressure and mirroring without diluting her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive is clear and sustained—answer the foam’s question and restore vanished paths—and her actions align with that drive. Interiority is specific (tea left too long in sorrow; copper on the tongue), but internal contradiction is mild and she rarely struggles. Competence dominates; success comes without a hard trade‑off beyond one dissolving glyph. The final stance shift is earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Velasco’s motive (“to serenade monotony with creativity”) drives specific choices—soliciting tokens, translating sounds, dispatching volunteers, and finally releasing the bishop—giving him clear agency with a visible renunciation at the end. Interiority is mostly implied through method and attention rather than dramatized conflict, so the inner contradiction remains light. Secondary figures get crisp, telling beats that reflect back on Velasco’s design without deepening his internal struggle. The final non‑intervention (letting the bishop drift) lands as a credible, earned choice with modest felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and urgent: to inscribe a world-sized poem despite a ban. Micro-choices under pressure are sharp—the decision to ingest the moonstone shard, then to choreograph the ensuing flood of memory. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, tying tide-dance craft to perception and risk. The final endurance—anchoring by chosen purpose—feels earned with visible cost (exhaustion, risk of discovery).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira’s motive (finish her mother’s work; mend town by mending glass) is clear and embodied in concrete choices (go to the pond; reweave panes rather than replace). Interiority is specific to a glazier’s perception, but internal contradiction is light—competence faces little friction beyond time. The “glass never lies” credo usefully frames her method and restraint. The final acceptance of visible fractures as song reads as a credible, earned shift rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rowan’s “hard softness” is embodied through ritual competence, tenderness with Juniper, and the costly choice to chip the heirloom box. Interiority is specific (breath, scent of charcoal, ropey scars) and contradictions persist credibly. The relationship pressure with Juniper sharpens his values without tidy absolution. A touch more on his resisting impulse before breaking the shard could heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ora’s motive is clear and consistent—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—and his restraint (“refused to rush”) grounds a credible internal tension between empathy and rigor. Embodied touches (calibrating the gauge to a “golden midpoint,” breath and salt air) keep emotions concrete. The cost is quiet but present: he accepts limits (closing hours, dimming lanterns) and the uncertainty of indirect impact. Slightly low friction—his competence rarely falters—keeps this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s motive is vivid and particular, and her micro‑choices (following the hum, conserving battery, deciding to guard the corridors) align with her vocation. The temptation to sell her findings versus her vow at the end provides a credible internal fork with a felt cost. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific rather than generic. A deeper moment of frictive hesitation under peak pressure could have pushed complexity even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motives are clear and embodied: finish the mural before the bells to return a child’s borrowed heartbeat and re-teach mirrors to show possibilities. The narrator’s micro-choices (steady breathing, holding silence as instrument) reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction (awe vs. fear of failure) is present but subtle; struggle is mostly smooth, reducing felt cost. Ariste’s shift from tremor to steadiness is earned through synchronized action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Petra’s interiority is precise and embodied—the ebony clipboard consoling and condemning her crystallizes her contradiction. Her choices under pressure (invoking the ritual; forcing the orphan-province clause) reveal values with cost. Secondary figures apply credible pressure while remaining distinct (brass‑armed Rourke vs. ascetic Laure). The endurance at the end reads earned: belief tempered by the knowledge of tomorrow’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Serafina’s contradiction—amoral benefactor and fierce sentimentalist—drives every choice, culminating in the costly decision to dismantle her own drought. Interiority is embodied (the parasol as altar cloth, the egg’s chirrup behind her ribs) and her micro-choices ladder plausibly to renunciation. Fyodor’s restrained pressure (“cleared his throat”) sharpens stakes and reveals their bond without melodrama. The final release forecloses a path (reputation/investors) with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirelle’s motive—to defy the court’s lullaby—drives clear, embodied actions (the shears, the true name, the final renunciation). Interiority is lyric but specific, with tactile micro‑choices under quiet pressure. Internal contradiction is present but soft; she encounters little resistance, so cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Laying down the shears credibly forecloses a path, but struggle remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motive (“explore ethical storytelling”) is clear and consistently embodied through micro‑choices: tilting the candle, reversing the miner’s tale, leaving before gratitude curdles, and refusing to teach. Interiority is textured (serene exterior with a “tremor of purpose”), though internal contradiction under live pressure is relatively gentle. The refusal to accept a teaching role at the end reads as an Earned Stasis with a plausible cost (foregone prestige/control). The piece could gain by sharpening a moment where his serenity risks failure or backlash on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pearl’s motive—honoring overlooked histories—clearly drives every tactic, and her method choices feel character‑specific. Interiority is lyric and filtered through her esoteric realist lens, but true internal contradiction under pressure is minimal. The piece favors competence and ritual mastery over visible struggle. The modest cost embraced—choosing transience over monument—reads as an earned stance rather than a wrenching change.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elien’s motive—to preserve forgotten names—interlocks with his guilt over the apprentice and his “technically gentle” craft, producing embodied, character‑specific choices (breathing on fibers, loosening eclipse knots). The self‑forgiveness pivot is dramatized (“work could not begin until he forgave himself”) and costs him. Internal contradiction (competent caster vs. self‑blame) resolves into a credible renunciation. The arc lands without safety‑hedging or therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority—curiosity as a “decaying directive”—drives concrete choices (pressing the seal to her forehead, dancing instead of analyzing). The internal contradiction (analysis vs. motion) resolves through earned action prompted by the riddle. Embodied perception is specific (“air tastes of copper,” spores like “moonlight and ground glass”), revealing temperament under pressure. The commitment to walk with cost (seal will shatter) reads as an authentic stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Naram-ben’s thrift versus hunger for discovery is dramatized in micro-choices, culminating in sacrificing his astrolabe. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“thrifty even with his awe”), and his fear never vanishes as he proceeds. The sacrifice forecloses a path with real cost and coheres with his flaw. A slight hedge is that he masters the tile with little visible struggle before the cost scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maro’s paradox (“scheming pacifist”) reads as specific and motivating, and Tyra’s embodied resentment—felt “in her marrow”—creates credible internal pressure. Micro-choices (Tyra placing her palm; accepting the vibration; the surrender) are earned by sensory persuasion rather than tidy rationalization. The release carries cost (grief, identity reconfiguration) shown through tears and the sanctuary absorbing “grey wisps.” A slight neatness in Maro’s guiding line (“Release him…”) edges toward didactic clarity but remains supported by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Haleh’s motive (capture a runaway dream) is clear and embodied through her craft; her micro‑choices with the broken sextant reveal competence and a calm, idiosyncratic spirituality. Internal contradiction (grounded body vs. boundary‑erasing vision) is present but lightly pressured. The piece leans toward mastery over struggle, so we get fewer frictive moments where contradictory impulses clash on the page. Still, the final acceptance of fracture as “essential contour” feels earned by prior perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Seraphin’s motives are clear and consistent—atonement-through-repair and protection of the orchard—embodied in tactile choices (the ribbon gift; the quartz eye’s coolness; the improvised mending). Interiority is particular and non-generic, with exile’s cost felt without self-pity. The relationship with Liora creates a live crucible, shifting status as she questions, learns, and commits. A minor softness: Seraphin’s competence blunts struggle at moments, though the ribbon forfeiture and risk of return register as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—he wants forbidden knowledge and pursues it through an idiosyncratic method. Contradictory impulses register in-scene (hunger vs. “willing to pay that fare”), embodied via frost in lungs and the cameo to the forehead. Micro-choices under pressure (bathroom inquiry, orchard kneeling, stewardship vow) credibly escalate. The final stewardship stance reads earned with a felt cost: being partially rewritten and living with charged uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ora’s drive (find the library) is clear and her resourcefulness is dramatized through micro‑choices (using the diary, rescuing patrons, proposing the seed‑memory). Her ambivalence toward Marrow (“prefers allies less paradoxical” yet hears the orchestra approve him) gives credible contradiction. Emotional embodiment is mostly via action and image rather than labels. The final alliance doesn’t exact a personal cost, but her solution still reveals her hierarchy of values (ingenuity over sacrifice).

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crisp (find brother/garden) and contradictory impulses (panic/hope; rescue him vs. abandon the lost) are live in scene. The choice to stitch a third path is earned by earlier cues (chimeric siblings, narrative threads) and carries cost. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“trapped freedom,” the card burning the palm). Slight convenience in the sibling’s unnoticed threads keeps it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑specific (an archivist seeking clarity), and her methodical temperament is dramatized through tactile choices with the rope. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so cost reads soft. Competent problem‑solving dominates over struggle. The final quiet renunciation of recognition is credible but not deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear desire (to find refuge/quiet) propels continuous micro‑choices from mapping to ritual, with a credible pivot when “bottling a gale” fails. Interiority is specific and embodied through tool‑use rather than label‑feelings. Internal tension (control vs. release; cartography vs. coaxing) is present, though the villagers’ pressure remains off‑stage and softens stakes slightly. The renunciation at the end (leaving the orb) reads earned with a modest, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lioh’s motive—rekindling the beacon to give pattern and meaning to chance—is concrete and sustained, and his fear of the hush swallowing sound counterweights his devotion. His choices (inserting the shard, singing to embed slivers) reveal character under pressure without hedging. Interiority is embodied through tactile work and image (“cupped that tremor with his palms”) rather than abstraction. Internal contradiction is present but delicate; a slightly deeper on‑page conflict could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s motive (to archive without bruising) is specific and tested as she balances rigor against “preemptive nostalgia.” Her micro‑choices—measuring shadows, following the fainter thread, and excising her own yearning—reveal a live value hierarchy. The cost (“The omission stung”) lands on the page. Internal contradiction is credible and sustained without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—“defiance was his tinder, playfulness his fuse”—and micro‑choices (reading the mosaic as code; opting for a silent ignition) reveal character under pressure. Contradictory impulses (seriousness/play) operate on the page. The chief limitation is low visible personal risk or cost to Cyril; his competence faces little friction before success.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marella’s interiority is specific and embodied—her tactile reading of stone and surf—and her contradiction (righteous anger vs measured tact) drives the choice. The final renunciation (gentle tide, not storm surge) feels earned by the cicada‑enabled foresight. Relationship dynamic with Quillon is quiet but functional, supplying pressure without stealing focus. Slightly soft cost embodiment (we feel the renunciation, less the strain of holding it) keeps this from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular: a claustrophobic child harvesting “flavors” of silence, then sacrificing a prized vial to save her father. Interiority is embodied through sensory synesthesia (warm brass, infant’s held breath) rather than labels. The relationship pressure is active on the page and alters behavior; offering the doll at the end credibly reconfigures their bond. A hairline quibble: the narrator navigates the emergency with high competence that slightly softens struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Gerard’s mission and methods feel specific and motivated, and Liora’s anxious embodiment (humming notebooks, lifted shoulders) reads concrete. Their micro‑choices—his invitation to the balustrade, breath‑syncing, the offered vial; her acceptance and exhale—credibly earn the shift. Internal contradiction is subtle but present (duty vs. mission; bracing vs. release). The cost is quiet—relinquishing the hum and urgency—yet legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kestrel’s motives and values are clear and consistent, and her renunciation at the sigil feels earned by prior images (murals “crowned with clarity”). Interiority is filtered through concrete perception (“futuristic nostalgia” in her chest), but contradictory impulses under peak pressure are light; the choice reads calm more than contested. Palim adds texture, not pressure. The visible cost—relinquishing sovereignty—is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s motivation—grief sublimated into stewardship—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (placing the ring, waiting, breathing with him, pressing palm to spine). Contradictory impulses (careful endings vs. clinging) surface in her refusal “to encroach” and the ultimate letting‑go. The cost—solitude reaffirmed—reads on the page. Slightly idealized competence is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cassia’s virtues and mischief run concurrently on the page—she slips the shift, pockets the bolt, then “volunteers her will”—so actions arise from a coherent contradiction. The pyramid‑scheme past motivates her hunger for “honest light,” sharpening the central choice. Embodiment through pressure (“air dense as kneaded clay”) grounds emotion. Minor note: one thematic line leans declarative, but it grows from her lived calculus rather than therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear, specific motivation (retrieve proof) evolves into a morally charged renunciation. Interiority is textured and embodied (listening to the room, “bridge of intuition”), with contradictory impulses shown in the hesitation before pocketing the cylinder. Micro-choices track: detect, retrieve, wind, listen, stop, conceal, restore. The cost is felt in her refusal—earned stasis with credible ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Caron’s motives (seeking a script larger than war) are clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices: unfolding the program, improvising the duel internally, hesitating at the torn page, and finally surrendering fear. Contradictory impulses—self‑protective coldness versus risky hope—play simultaneously at the missing‑page beat. The price (relinquishing wars, titles, lonely certainty) is legible at the end. Interiority stays character‑particular and avoids therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a rule‑bound archivist who bends procedure at personal risk to honor a small kindness. Her interiority is concrete (dust rituals, bodily memory of emancipation) and her micro‑choices escalate credibly (seeking Fulton’s signature, bicycling in rain, plain talk with Jordan). Jordan’s guardedness and shift to stillness under the story’s weight read authentic. The final “first suture” earns its cost from her exposure and procedural defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lina’s motive—resisting the “tyranny of indifference”—is clear and consistently expressed through precise, resourceful tactics (umbrella concealment, scavenged key, puddle‑map). Interiority is concise but textured via embodied detail (“felt each deletion like a skin bruise”). The fear/courage tension spikes at the alarms, though internal contradiction remains relatively soft compared to her competence. The final acceptance of harboring the voices forecloses her anonymity with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, compelling motive (silence the prophecy) with embodied stakes and a tactile relationship to his instrument and the grotto. Interiority is specific (mother’s clarinet, “vested hush”) and actions align with values. Internal contradiction is light—he never seriously wavers—which softens the felt price. Still, the final renunciation of recognition (“absence was the truest report”) lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Briony’s motivation is precise and consistent (orderly decoding for the herbarium), and her choices drive each turn (following the silver leaf, sealing the mound, accepting the caretaker role). Interiority is particular to her temperament (“patient as lichen,” exacting rituals) with embodied actions rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light; she pivots from skepticism to acceptance without much friction. The felt cost is conceptual—accepting ongoing duty and time pressure—rather than emotionally bruising.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Milo’s motive—fixing failures and “befriending uncertainty”—channels into concrete choices (opening the vellum, descending, finally smashing the compass). Interiority is specific and embodied (leaves brush “like restless clocks,” soot, mist), revealing a mind patterned by time-tech metaphors. The final renunciation forecloses certainty with a legible cost (destroying the guide). A slight tendency toward aphoristic self-declaration (“His purpose felt clear…”) trims some rawness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline (find/restore Jory through earned guilt), with concrete micro-choices under pressure (melt coin, etch mirror symbol, drop her own name). Contradictory impulses—pride vs. regret—are dramatized rather than declared, especially in the mirror-facing beat. Emotional embodiment is strong (“each tear a small coin of salt”); choices cost her self‑image. Minor note: interior conflict could show one more moment of hesitation before the irreversible act to press cost even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eluan’s motive—soothing lost souls by integrating genuine laughter—is clear and drives micro‑choices (tavern‑joke progression, self‑deprecation, then choosing to guide rather than merely amuse). The “price of half‑measures” realization credibly compels him to uncork the vial. Interiority is mostly embedded in action and image, with embodied cost in tears and “luminous ache.” Internal contradiction is light but present (soft chuckle as invitation vs. awareness of cost).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Embodied interiority is vivid and particular (bones whisper coordinates; pain translated to coefficients) with a clear, consistent drive to “discover the mathematics of mercy.” The survivor’s endurance under pressure is credible and earned, with micro‑choices (kneeling, pressing the strap, refusing the proof) revealing values under threat. Contradictory impulses surface (despair vs. refusal), though the conceptual diction sometimes distances raw emotion. The final renunciation/transformational insight feels motivated by prior tactile and cognitive struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Irida’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—drives every choice, from barter to relinquishment, with embodied moments (“weight of future errands bent her knees”). Interiority is specific and sensorial, showing how she maps sound to shade rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is modest (devotion vs. the cost of surrender), with little messy friction beyond resolve. The relationship with Aven supports rather than pressures, limiting crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlen’s professional acuity and private compulsion (“to discover what ceilings hide”) drive clear, motivated choices (breaker panel, dust analysis, bypassing ladder for panel crawl). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heart drumming like a calliope”). Internal conflict is muted—he encounters little resistance beyond eerie atmosphere—so the emotional cost feels light. Still, the final renunciation (donating the device) credibly reflects his values.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ellis’s motive—compress eternity before rules solidify—drives concrete choices (uncorking, composing, printing, ingesting the page). The internal contradiction between adoring destabilization and fearing a shattering misstep gives texture to his risk. Interiority is specific to his craft and sensibility, though bodily stakes and stress embodiment are lightly sketched. The final renunciation/embrace (taking the page into his body) feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Velen’s drive—rusted idealism sharpened into a risky experiment—tracks cleanly from longing to action to a sober vow. Contradictory impulses (desire for vindication vs. grief over past defeat) coexist in the storm scene and at the win. Micro‑choices (borrowing the Grotto, covering mirrors, translating despite pain) reveal values under pressure. The final endurance—choosing ongoing work rather than basking in victory—lands as earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clean and character-specific—Clay solves by “work not words,” consistent with a meticulous craftsman. The “wilts near dishonesty” trait meaningfully shapes tactics and the cost he accepts. Limited contradictory impulses on the page (he rarely wavers or struggles), which restrains depth. Still, micro-choices (whispering joy-names, using tools that mend what isn’t torn) reveal priorities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—an obsessive petrichor collector seeking “the place where explanations fail”—and it coherently drives each choice down to releasing the bottled rain. Interiority is embodied through scent and tactile cues (grease, ghost steam, pulsating brass), with fear and wonder in credible tension. While the piece is largely internal, micro‑choices under pressure (using psychometry, paddling blind, stepping through) reveal a clear value hierarchy. The final renunciation of the collection reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iona’s motives (deliver a commission; then accept emissary duty) are legible and escalate into concrete choices (entering the projection, committing days to build the gate). Fear and curiosity coexist on the page, with embodied perception (“tasting salt like punctuation”) grounding interiority. The credo “scaffold complexity with simplicity” meaningfully informs design choices rather than staying a label. Minor shortfall: conflict is gentle; deeper cost to abandoning the original errand remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maris’s drive is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited question and artistic temperament, and her choices (seeking the window, decoding, painting) align. Interiority is vivid through sensory bias rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses, so the cost reads gentle. The felt price is mostly elegiac (the mural fades; her grandfather’s unfinished quest) rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—defying remote archiving to seek firsthand testimony—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices (the kite, the debris‑code, the final question). Interiority is embodied via seizures and sensory bleed (“kerosene,” “boots”) rather than label‑speak. The inner contradiction (duty vs. dangerous truth‑seeking) is present but could tighten earlier on the zeppelin to deepen cost. Still, the closing endurance—choosing the ledger as revolt—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motives are coherent and intensify: guilt → purpose → sacrificial joining. Embodied perception (“calloused fingers,” “salt-slick pier”) grounds interiority. Contradictory impulses—fear of illusion vs. refusal of false comfort—surface at the pier and before the final step. The final renunciation (entering the bottle) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Loranth’s motives (oath-bound archivist vs. the dawning sense that some emotions must be released) drive concrete choices—descending to the cistern, conjuring discs, and finally planting the core. Interiority is textured and embodied (“velvet disquiet,” copper-and-parchment air), with a credible internal contradiction between duty and risk. The cost—choosing release over pure containment—registers on the page. Slight softness: the struggle feels relatively frictionless once the instruction appears.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Alma’s motive (to “discover the texture of borrowed time”) is clear and drives every action, and the cost (visible aging) lands. “Furiously tranquil” reads embodied in her measured ritual under a blizzard’s pressure. Internal contradiction is present but light; she rarely falters or doubts. Micro-choices (placing the egg, descending, using the cap, continuing despite aging) align cleanly with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are clear: a creed of “listening over noise” vs. the urgent risk of inaction. Interiority is concrete and embodied (rope in her hand, skin prickling, ladders, quartz petals). Her decisive override of the programmed margin feels earned by prior curiosity and field readings. Slightly low cost after validation by hail keeps it from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Janus’s spiritual curiosity vs. protocol creates credible internal conflict that drives concrete choices (watching first, mapping, then ritual repair). Interiority is specific and embodied (broom as conductor, lantern shards as “shy eyes”). The change—finding strength in vulnerability—is earned by the empathic labor and risk. A slightly easy success softens the felt cost, but motivation remains coherent and active.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orin’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an exile who craves purpose, mute yet attuned to “unsaid verses.” His micro-choices (refusing to speak, reading echoes, waiting for hours, pressing the wax to his chest) align with temperament and escalate commitment. The visible cost—bearing a vow “like a hive filled at midsummer”—reads as Earned Stasis. Slight limitation: internal conflict stays cool and assured; doubt (“invitation or trap”) never meaningfully destabilizes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Basil’s drive—to understand time’s texture before his own runs out—grounds every choice and culminates in relinquishing the chronometer. Interiority is embodied and specific (listening to “the silence between ticks” as velvet). A credible ambivalence appears when he pauses to invite others before weaving. Minor risk: the “braided cloth” comprehension edges toward a neat epiphany but is earned by on‑page phenomena.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Edda’s motive (to seek beauty in the incomplete) drives concrete choices—entering the lagoon, inviting the boy to mend, and sacrificing the feather. Interiority is specific and embodied (silt ghosts, woven dawns) with a credible contradiction (storm-chasing vs. patient tending). The relationship with the boy becomes the crucible where her stance is tested and enacted. The visible cost—giving up the feather—earns the change.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive—use her remaining months to wire an orchard into interspecies speech—is precise and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (climbing, soldering, logging). Her “brazen calm” against a ticking death clock yields credible endurance with cost. Interiority stays embodied via tool use, breath pacing, and tide‑synced movement. The priest beat offers a light relational crucible, though opposition is gentle rather than testing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iris’s motives (rebellious inquiry, homecoming anxiety) are clear and deepen under pressure; her insight that “return could be inquiry, not retreat” meaningfully reorients her choices. The embodied cost is legible when footprints evaporate and reagents are sacrificed. Athan functions as a credible foil whose skepticism flickers under sensory anomaly (chiming amber). Change is earned: their hand‑in‑hand step follows prior micro‑choices and internal recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and particular: to restore the battlefield without chemicals and to honor a lapsed treaty. Interiority is embodied through action (reading foam, refusing to move during the “fragile congress”) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal—he reads as serenely competent, with little on‑page self‑conflict—but the endurance and renunciation of former work (passengers) land. The final choice to become an itinerant storyteller‑gardener credibly extends his established values.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orin’s motives—purpose after retirement, curiosity, and a fragile hope—drive concrete choices from needle-setting to leaving the settlement, with Barrow functioning as relational pressure. The moment “as though asking whether I still believed in anywhere else” surfaces a credible internal contradiction. Emotional embodiment stays image-led but specific (breath too loud; birds extinct yet “sing inside my chest”). Slight ease in problem‑solving (leaf-as-key with no friction) trims perceived struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is specific and embodied: honoring a family ritual to bridge a temporal gulf. Interiority is textured with concrete actions (killing the lamp, aligning the compass, folding the ship) under pressure and grief. Contradictory impulses—exile vs belonging, confusion vs exploration—operate simultaneously. One aphoristic line (“truth is a direction…”) skews tidy but is grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and enacted: Kestrel’s “caution wrapped around abandon” manifests in the pause on the stair and the theatrical reveal. Embodiment is specific (gloved hands bleeding through frost) and her micro‑choices under pressure track. The chivalrous restraint—amending rather than stealing—carries a felt cost (“thief’s pockets empty”). Slight softness: the Curator’s resistance fades quickly, limiting deeper exposure of Kestrel’s contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ezra’s motive—“apprentice to memory”—drives every action, and his contradiction (opportunist/martyr) flickers in the offer of joint stewardship over control. Interiority is embodied (bishop scrape as syllables; palm to cold geometry) and decisions under pressure are legible. Calypso’s benevolent ruthlessness applies immediate relational pressure and shifts status on the floor-as-board. The final choice feels earned and exposes a cost: surrendering sole custody to preserve integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystalline (“to understand the shape of home”) and drives concrete choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied and particular—map as feather felt rather than seen; “heavier than regret.” The shift from fearing pain to seeding talents reads earned through on‑page trial. If anything, contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized as a sharp internal clash.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhaun’s motive (self‑forgiveness) drives concrete micro‑choices—the bead rearrangement toward prudence, the maze’s “humility,” and finally speaking the warnings he withheld. Contradictory impulses—brilliance vs. mercy, action vs. remorse—operate simultaneously and resolve through a costly renunciation of his self‑image. Embodied actions (needles, tweezers, lifting hedges) externalize his interior struggle without therapy‑speak. The redemption lands slightly neatly, but it’s earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s drive is clear and specific—she seeks forgiveness but refuses the spire’s memory-price—so she invents an alternative bargain that fits her defiant artistry. Interiority comes via embodied choices (colored sands, poems-as-knives) rather than abstract labels, and the refusal to forget is a credible cost. The Marshal’s micro-arc (forgetting the warrant, then nodding to the exchange) adds live relational pressure. Minor note: her internal contradiction is felt more through image than explicit tension, but it still reads.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Brielle’s motives are clear and intensify under pressure, from duty to mend history to the terrifying, earned choice to mend herself. Contradictory impulses—self-preservation versus truth-telling—operate in-scene (lung starvation against the compulsion to narrate). Micro-choices (timing breaths, choosing to recount her village, pressing the charm to her throat) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The transformation is credible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, character‑specific motive—honoring a private vow—drives embodied choices: entering the cave, turning left, setting the shell, painting the mirror, and leaving it behind. Interiority is concrete and particular (“intimately aloof,” the seashell sunrise, mirror echo) and his contradictions (aloof yet yearning) are dramatized, not told. The cost—relinquishing the shell and accepting ephemerality—reads on the page. Minor note: internal friction could sharpen once inside the cave, but the arc remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s motive—to prove whispers outcarry shouts—drives concrete choices (the vial ritual, the balcony test, timing with nautical dawn). Interiority is specific and embodied (“expression of screaming tenderness,” “breath frosting the air”). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (gentleness courting bravado) rather than forcefully tested. The relationship with Bram adds soft pressure and guidance without undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marrow’s motives are precise and embodied—she’s compelled by the midnight voice and by a grief-work calling that becomes a renunciation at the end. The internal conflict between following the currents and staying to steward others culminates in an earned refusal with visible cost. Micro-choices (salvaging parts, feeding “names” as coordinates, fine-tuning the censer foot) reveal values under pressure. No safety-hedging: her choice sacrifices self and station stability to keep the channel open.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ilya’s motives (to buffer honesty into kindness) are clear and consistent, and his flaw (overriding rationalism under a truth‑compulsion) drives choice. The confession about abandoning his sister lands as a real cost and reorients his values. Embodied detail (probe in mud, copper taste, hiss of panic) prevents therapy‑speak. The late exchange with Mara adds a social vector that pressures him into community over solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Oswald’s curiosity, reverence for the lighthouse, and patient eccentricity cohere into a specific, embodied interiority. His micro‑choices (pinning the Edelweiss, shutting his eyes to “listen to gaps,” prying the board carefully) reveal a value hierarchy. The contradiction—solitary devotion versus the intimacy he’s asked to guard—surfaces credibly at the ampoule. The final acceptance reads as an earned endurance with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s empirically intuitive nature is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (trusting ants, fitting the chip, choosing the sister’s arch) under rising pressure. His conflicting impulses—fear of erasing her versus honoring the promise—are present at the threshold. Embodied perception (ants as pilgrims, the chip’s weight, floral warmth) keeps emotions grounded. The change is earned when he forecloses other futures by choosing her name.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sereya’s motives—guilt and the need to repair what she wounded—are legible and escalate into a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (bleeding starlight as conscience), and actions align with her flaw and growth. The relationship with Riall subtly reconfigures (loyalty shifts from crown to woman) without stealing focus. A minor slip: the “softly commanding” trait does work, but its costs remain mostly thematic rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cressida’s motive (bottle the “density of presence”) is concrete and drives choices; her renunciation is earned by the shell’s tests and Roan’s whispered injunction. Interiority is sensorial and particular (salt, star-dust; equations reshelving), with credible contradiction between ambition and ethical caution. Roan’s “scientifically romantic” pressure lands via his attempted capture and consequent burn, sharpening their dynamic. The final choice forecloses mastery with a felt cost (she gives up the powerful, city-healing path for principled uncertainty).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and particular, with a credible push-pull between duty (distilling chaos) and feral jealousy of past selves. Micro-choices under pressure—stepping into the wind, sending the breath‑plane, choosing charcoal to finish—align with motives and reveal values. The cost registers when the rookie foregoes the ascent, foreclosing an ego-affirming path. Emotions stay embodied (metallic bees, ranger‑issue wool) without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amira’s motives and grief are concrete, embodied, and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (gloves, filing, listening) revealing value hierarchy under pressure. The internal contradiction—quiet grief versus a practiced, humanizing poise—registers without therapy‑speak. Competence slightly outpaces struggle (the repair proceeds smoothly), trimming the sense of risk. Still, the sacrifice of the water clock part and the final journal map earn the modest reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Seren’s motive—turning scars into stories—drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the blood‑ink rune that risks censure and pain. Interiority is textured (thunderbird superstition, lullaby letters) and embodied without therapy‑speak. The contradiction of fear versus authorship is dramatized rather than declared. Master Yulo’s passivity keeps relational pressure low, but it doesn’t blunt her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marisol’s motivation—to atone for a past harm and free Dulio—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through risky, tactile choices (perfume, coil, playing the piano). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with guilt and nerve in tension. The admission that she printed the rumor gives her flaw teeth and informs the morning’s “imperfect miracle.” If there’s a limit, her internal conflict is elegantly handled but not stress‑fractured into a truly painful on‑page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular drive (“end of history witness” seeking to unravel the lie) and several micro-choices under pressure (showing “Now,” initiating the plea, throwing the dictionary, consenting to “let go”). Internal contradiction—speaking both doubt and faith until neither remains—reads credibly if abstract. Emotional embodiment is lighter than conceptual architecture, softening the felt cost slightly. The renunciation at the end is earned but more head than body.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Trond’s vocation, curiosity, and anxiety are clearly dramatized through tactile choices (opening the hatch, extracting the billet, using the key). Interiority is specific and embodied (“one slip could sever a thought”; feeling the wedge resisting his glove). The change—accepting stewardship as “keeping the dialogue whole”—is earned by discovery rather than declared. Slightly limited by minimal contradictory impulses under pressure; he moves steadily from question to revelation with little self‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s safety-vs-surrender conflict is embodied in precise choices: approaching the barrier, pressing the button, recalibrating sensors, and embracing the duplicate. Interiority is vivid and character‑specific (security mind meets physics past). The cost—abandoning a prevention ethos for permeability—reads on the page via administrator expectations and the rule “everything glows, nothing hides.” Minor neatness in the aphoristic “nothing secure can grow” keeps it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s motive—reconciling probability with grief—is clear, layered, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (taking the D-line, collecting graffiti, breaking the pane). Contradictory impulses (control vs. surrender) co-exist on the page and culminate in a costly, earned act. Embodied emotion remains specific (wet clover, squeaking shoes) rather than diagnostic. A touch of aphoristic summary surfaces near the end but does not undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rich, specific interiority and motive (“Wrong numbers are my currency”) translate into concrete micro‑choices: rerouting the poet, striking the disc, reframing the goodbye to his younger self. The manipulative vocation versus genuine tenderness creates live contradiction. The renunciation/reframe at the end reads earned with a felt cost tied to the mother’s leaving. Minor hedge: the operator’s darkness (“cultivate estrangement”) is largely aestheticized, not fully stress‑tested interpersonally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear, character‑specific motive (archivist resisting myth in favor of proximate causes) collides with a miraculous artifact, producing credible internal contradiction. The decisive choice—sliding the inked note over the photo—emerges from established traits and carries ethical cost (crossing from observer to agent). Embodied emotion and sensory bias are strong (“salt met perfume,” “haunted euphoria”). The endurance/renunciation of neutrality is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s “desperately jocular” loneliness is embodied in micro‑choices (sneaking in at dusk, opening with a joke, consenting to the ritual). Milo’s motives read consistent and particular: reciprocity and logistics as ethic. The group’s presence pressures the narrator into communal vulnerability without speechifying. The closing urge “to reciprocate” feels earned, though the visible cost is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is vivid and particular—she wants to chart the stillpoint to guide pilgrims and herself—and actions align, culminating in surrendering the inherited ring. Interiority is sensorial and embodied (learning glacier patience, fern regret) with a credible knot of resistance. The internal turn—pressing her palm to her chest—shows contradictory impulses reconciling under pressure. Slight idealization and serenity under stress keep it just short of truly jagged complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear motive (atoning for prior harm) and credible internal conflict (urge to fix vs. choice to accompany) drive micro‑choices from pricking the finger to uncoupling the pen. Interiority is specific and character‑particular, not diagnostic. The renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost (retiring the tool and ambition). A hairline softness remains around how brittle “faith” concretely impedes tactics before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive (to translate silence and break the town’s hush before dawn) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices—tracing glyphs, knocking posts, arranging “twelve hushes.” Her “joyful sorrow” complicates the drive, visible in frightened tears and endurance as Harlan fades. The relationship with Harlan applies active pressure (time, technique) rather than comfort. Minor shortfall: interior contradiction is mostly tonal rather than decision‑forked.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ash’s motivation—rescuing a long‑deferred promise—drives every choice and is embodied in concrete acts (decoding sigils, following murals, returning the ember). Interiority is specific and character‑particular (“volcanic tenderness,” “flames once trembled her”) with guilt and devotion layered credibly. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (arsonist seeking gentleness); a sharper on‑page moment of temptation or refusal could deepen cost. The final renunciation—giving up the ember—reads earned and alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ira’s grief and “quiet rebellion” are embodied in concrete choices—signing with lemon‑juice annotations, defying protocol by tapping, and ultimately sacrificing private memory. Her motive (shared dream over money) is clear and consistent, and contradictory impulses (obedience vs. revolt; privacy vs. offering) operate simultaneously. The cost registers when she releases her sister’s memory into the collective. Secondary figures stay peripheral, but the single‑POV focus feels intentional and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlin’s perceptual quirk (identifying walks) and “calculated spontaneity” guide concrete choices under pressure, and his rapport with Liora carries subtext. Motivation is clear—prove whispers outpace shouts and secure evidence for rewiring—and decisions align (key use, vent‑murmur misdirection). Interiority is specific and embodied (“electricity prickle his beard”) without therapy‑speak. The cost is lighter than maximal—risk of being recorded is noted but not dramatically biting on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied motivation and a credible internal conflict: the narrator’s guarded grief versus the lure and cost of release. Micro-choices under pressure (following the guardian, accepting the shutter, nodding to spend the secret) feel earned. The guardian’s opacity works as pressure rather than absence. The final renunciation pays a felt price without tidy emotional erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive—to seed “forests of second thoughts”—is specific and consistent, and his tactics (the grotto trip, the townwide displays) align. Interiority is strong and embodied through sensory attention, but true internal contradiction is minimal; he meets little friction beyond patience and anonymity. The renunciation of applause is credible and pays off thematically. A touch more live resistance or self-doubt under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eren’s motive—restless drive toward freedom in a world where violence is impossible—is clear, embodied, and sharpened by the scrimshaw and whale call. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. surrender) operate simultaneously, especially when he sets the oars across the gunwales. His final renunciation of the “assigned” life carries visible cost. A slight hedge is that his unlocking feels partly facilitated by external forces (whale/scrimshaw) rather than hard-fought internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marrow’s purpose (to make grief bearable under coercion) and Ithica’s split between fear of penalties and need to mourn are dramatized through concrete choices. Interiority is mostly externalized but specific: “mocked and comforted,” panic at sirens, and the careful painted smile. Their actions (hosting, narrating, offering the bouquet, carving/accepting the lamp) align with motives and reveal value hierarchies under pressure. The final endurance—opting for compliant poise that preserves grief—reads as an earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motive (“to stride through boundaries once thought sacred”) and the poet’s (“test whether the song still remembered us”) are clear, aligned, and drive choices from travel to public risk. Interiority is concrete and embodied (the shard’s pulse syncing with ribs), with a credible tension between uncertainty and attraction to risk. Micro‑choices—agreeing to paraphrase through the night, accepting the notebook—reveal values. The cost is subtle but present: they forgo safety for public exposure under a recently lifted ban.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio’s motive (proving beauty in imperfection despite colorblindness) is vivid and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (bouquet code, tasting heat, accepting lopsided forms). His flaw becomes a strength without feeling cheap; the “crack lets more music out of a bell” line ties trait to action. Relationship pressure with Goran evolves credibly from skepticism to shared breath, with humility and risk as costs. Internal contradiction is subtle (vulnerability vs. competence) but present and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s motives and values are clear and embodied: his vow, scars, and “powerfully gentle” ethic drive micro-choices (insisting on questioning, shifting from performance to imperfect hum). The relationship with Senka provides credible, respectful pressure and contrast. Interiority stays concrete (knuckles humming, throat scars tightening) with minimal abstraction. A couple aphoristic lines flirt with thesis‑speak but are earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lenore’s grief-driven motives are specific and embodied, and her micro-choices (tattooing herself, seeding the city with coordinates, reengineering lockets and the watch) align with a credible internal drive. The transformation is earned through on‑page cost (blood, exposure, relinquishing her prior trade’s comforts). Internal contradiction (sorrow vs. making) is present but mostly harmonized, leaving little messy friction at peak beats. Still, the final acceptance reads convincingly as an earned reconfiguration rather than a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motives (Jonas seeks a lens; Mirelle tests and guides) with embodied choices (placing zero at his heart; her final counsel). Jonas’s doubt versus curiosity yields a credible shift. Interiority leans toward Mirelle’s perceptual filter but still renders Jonas’s fragility and craft‑tethered mind. Cost is subtle (ceding solitary control), yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kesari’s drive (condemned yet compelled) is vivid, and her micro-choices under pressure—breaking rhythm, counting primes, surrendering the veil—arise from coherent flaws and values. Emotion is embodied (scents, marrow‑felt note, searing glyphs) rather than labeled. The renunciation of the saffron veil and enduring the glyphs’ pain credibly foreclose prior identity. Minor note: the “purify the record” vow leans declarative but is paid off in action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motives are clear and particular—Eira’s need to preserve hope for her vanished grandmother and the narrator’s allied drive. Trust is earned through concrete behavior (“anyone who honors unseen editors will honor secrets”). The narrator’s micro‑choice to stay while offering the password‑coat and Eira’s costly descent register as credible under pressure. Slight gap: internal contradiction is present but mild; the piece could sharpen the felt risk to Eira’s identity/role when breaking the charter.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Calder’s motive (admiration vs. truth) is explicit and his micro-choices (trimming adjectives, stitching pauses, burning the dyed lining) embody inner conflict with tactile specificity. The admission “I wanted admiration more than truth” lands as earned rather than proclaimed. The tenderness with creatures counterweights his fraud credibly, giving the change a felt cost. Slight neatness—little active resistance to change—keeps it shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Odelia’s motive—seeking “closure” by reopening wounds—is specific, embodied, and consistent, and her micro‑choices (cutting sutures, following plant counsel, sprinting to the courtyard) align under pressure. The paradox (“welcomed pain”) plays as a live contradiction rather than a label. Slight softness: she encounters little internal resistance once the miracle’s nature is revealed, making the cost read more physical than moral. Still, the final renunciation of safety for the child’s life lands as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motive is clear and particular—retrieve “unused love” and return it—and her micro‑choices (gloving up, pressing a frame to her brow, choosing to project) align. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembling with tender responsibility”). Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or pays a sharp emotional price beyond letting go. The change—she departs carrying no unused love—lands but with a gentle cost profile.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear from the vow and sustained through the fear of losing his “lantern,” culminating in the renunciation of the quill. Interiority is embodied and particular (“moth wings,” “shadowed rapture”), with a live internal contradiction at the surrender beat. Micro-choices—pausing to rest, tracing meteors, yielding the last speck, stepping back from the quill—reveal a hierarchy of values with real cost. If anything, his flaw profile skews saintly, but the fear/emptiness tension keeps it credible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s vow, insomnia, and tender competence with machines create a coherent, specific interior. His fear of not dreaming conflicts with the duty to tend dream‑seeds, yielding credible ambivalence. Micro‑choices (pocketing the clock, raising it, committing to the subsong) align with motive and escalate toward the hinge. The final stance—vigilance as a form of caretaking—feels earned, though the felt cost remains delicate rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jonas’s motive—to map the frontier of his mind—is clear and enacted through specific choices (choosing west, seating himself, inviting the system to “show me,” selecting a destination). Internal contradiction is lighter: curiosity vs. overwhelm is present but rarely bites with cost beyond “suddenly tired.” Embodied perception is strong (sounds as maps, the gear’s absence ticking), though the emotional struggle stays serene. The final step forward reads earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lis’s motive is clean and embodied (fear thrumming, slipping on “petals of fog”), and her micro-choices (accepting the unlit lantern, following echoes, kneeling to wait) earn the shift. Internal contradiction (drive vs. fear) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous push-pull. The guides apply gentle, apt pressure without stealing her agency. The change—waiting until the flame appears—reads earned with a quiet cost (enduring uncertainty).

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ellis’s vow “to understand the cost of safety” cleanly motivates his restraint and the decisive risk of loosening the bolt. His internal conflict—duty to the fortress’s hush versus Mara’s “frostbitten hope”—is dramatized in the chapel scene, not told. Embodied perception (heaters humming, frost whispering, metal like “a single drop of mercury”) keeps emotions grounded. If anything, Mara’s interiority is thinner, but her presence effectively sharpens Ellis’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivations are clean and consistent (Lysar’s vow; Selestine’s devotion to ordered truth), and actions track. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotional texture are minimal; it reads more mythic-summarized than in-scene felt. The alliance forms credibly, and Lysar’s renunciatory fade has cost, but we don’t see complex internal struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s drive to understand disappearing paths is clear and embodied through tactile, profession‑colored choices (tapping, aligning maps, hydrophone testing). Contradictory impulses—vertigo vs. resolve, ritual patience vs. risky descent—surface credibly. The note she leaves (“If I do not return...”) makes the cost legible and earns the final choice. A touch more on how the coral‑bleaching past complicates her present risk would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maris’s motive—finding meaning in broken things during a fragile truce—drives concrete choices (descending barefoot, trusting the circle, choosing “music, not weapons”). Embodied cues (oily dust, numbing toes, gravel biting) keep emotion lived-in. Internal conflict surfaces around rebellion’s momentum vs. her alternative vision, though contradictory impulses do not pinch as hard as they could at the peak. The final renunciation is credible and character‑true, with implied cost (time pressure, risk of defying generals) rather than dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s motive—to evolve tradition rather than smash it—drives concrete choices (retrieving the kite, risking the springs, making the pledge). Interiority balances insurgent thrill with grandmotherly caution, creating a credible internal tension. The telepathy externalizes her empathy and methods without feeling gimmicky. Minor softness: obstacles yield a bit easily, limiting visible strain.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Anisa’s motives are precise and embodied—she wants “optimism anchored in realism,” and her freeze/lead tension plays in scene when thunder hits. The relationship with Malik provides a credible scaffold and pressure relief without dissolving her agency. Small, concrete micro‑choices (seed ritual, palm to glass, continuing the tour post‑trigger) reveal hierarchy of values. The only softness is slight thematic label‑speak around “neuroscience” that edges toward explained rather than purely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven motive (mother’s portrait/Moon) is specific and sustained, and his micro-choices under pressure—following smoke threads, taking the mirror shard, stepping into rising water, and finally relinquishing the card—reveal contradictory impulses (capture vs surrender). Embodied cues (“wet linen,” boots in pooling water) keep emotion grounded amid lyricism. The final renunciation feels earned and forecloses a path. Occasional abstraction slightly mutes visceral texture in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sulin’s motivation is clear and character-specific, with the “serene anger” and “consciously wild” tension giving him a distinctive interior engine. His need for measurement against instinct lands in the micro-choice to spill the ink and declare a motive. The decision to descend rather than immediately free the campers forecloses an easier path and reads as a costed commitment. Minor note: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder at the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ila’s conflicting impulses are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (incinerate vs. transmit; Alcove Seven; waking the comms), with embodied stress (“gloves trembled,” “a second heartbeat”). Her motivation coheres with action and escalates credibly. The late relationship beat with Malvek creates a live moral crucible without sentimental smoothing. Cost is accepted on the page (oath breach, exposure) rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amber’s motives and values are embodied through concrete micro‑choices (closing vents, sheathing the knife, offering virtues), and the father–daughter dynamic reframes her pacifism under pressure. The scars on her palms and Cullin’s tool‑swap to a watering can reveal character without speechifying. Internal conflict is present but tidy; her nonviolence never meaningfully wavers after the sheathing beat. The reconciliation lands, though the ease of the council’s softening reduces visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Arlen’s motive (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear, and his internal contradiction—hunter’s hunger versus ethical release—tightens credibly at the star‑warning beat. Embodied, character‑specific perception (“reading interference lines,” hush that “bruised the ribs”) grounds emotion without labels. The final renunciation feels earned by prior tactics and reveals cost (relinquishing the rarest catch). Minor note: he’s highly competent with limited visible error, but the hesitation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amelia’s motive—curiosity versus inherited loyalty—drives every beat and culminates in a costly vow. Contradictory impulses are active on the page (fear of lawsuits/orbiting reputations vs. responsibility). The micro‑choice to scratch the orrery with the pen nib externalizes her internal turn. Her decision to finance reparations with the sale of her estate makes the cost concrete, not merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lin’s motivation—atonement for harm caused by his firmware—is vivid and consistent, and his craft (constellation tattooing) becomes the means of moral action. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“cathedral after bells”; “circuits inside him twitch”), with a credible cost in the felt absence after the tethering. The contradictory impulse surfaces at the climax: he expects triumph but experiences loss and smallness, making the change earned rather than tidy. Minor note: external resistance is minimal, but the internal pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Felicity’s motives and choices are coherent and embodied—she refuses speech, “interjects” with chalk, opens the iris, then erases the visions, accepting a non‑mythic answer. Interiority is implied through tactile attention and social acuity rather than told feelings. Secondary figures press subtly but productively, revealing her leadership under hush. The change (trading prophecy for practical reordering) reads earned, though internal contradiction could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aarik’s motive (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is distinct and consistently enacted through tactile choices (barefoot on cracked stone, arranging tesserae, voicing the name). Interiority is embodied via grief-as-temper imagery rather than labels. The relationship with Rima supports rather than pressures him, so crucible dynamics stay gentle. The cost is mostly conceptual—relinquishing the retrocognitive trap—credible but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The janitor’s curiosity and synesthetic wiring ground his swift agreement, with a credible wobble at “how a janitor can manage such braidwork.” His final choice—to be late for work—registers as a small but honest cost consistent with character. Interiority is vivid and embodied (smelling trumpet flourishes, tasting saffron heartbeats). A touch more resistance under peak pressure could have deepened the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s “affectionate skeptic” stance governs every choice: swallowing the pill only after building measurement scaffolds, prioritizing “measure before we marvel,” and finally halting the test to protect the discovery. Contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. control—act simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choices with the geode, shutters, and breath reveal values under pressure. The visible cost is stopping the breakthrough the moment it blooms.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ruen’s motive conflict (Ministry data vs. “voice of the unknown”) is clean, embodied, and escalates to a renunciation. His micro-choices under pressure—placing the fossil on the floating water, pressing it to the fissure, stepping into the corridor—align with character and reveal priorities. The internal turn from ambition to “be the hinge that sings” feels earned with a visible cost (isolation, sealing in). Minor note: his competence remains high; a touch more falter could deepen the human texture.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lenra’s motive is precise and active, and her micro‑choices (button patterns, opening the doors, transcribing) reveal a steady, craftsmanlike will. Interiority is tangible through sensory focus rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is mild; the cost of “sharing” reads more conceptual than personally fraught. The character endures pressure credibly but with limited ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motive (to test and possibly repair trust) is concrete and her micro-choices—climbing, writing in snow, revealing the gear—align with a cautious-but-bold temperament. Interiority is embodied in tactile actions (cold fingers, sutured tension) rather than labels. The relationship crucible with Elias tightens convincingly, with status parity and mutual scars. A minor softness: inner contradiction is present but mostly lyrical, not pressured into a near-failure before the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivations are lucid (to distill complexity into essence), and the coachman’s offered needle and final renunciation of former questions mark credible, earned shifts. Interiority is conveyed through tactile attention and ritual rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is muted; pressure never forces a sharp, costly split in him beyond a quiet relinquishment. The woman reads purposeful but remains more emblem than fully contended psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rua’s motive—to understand resistance to change—drives concrete, character‑specific actions (rotating the lantern, embedding the shard, crafting bee cups, deciding to wait and build a kiln). His “sharp gentleness” is embodied rather than labeled, and micro‑choices reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (seeker of silence shaping interventions), but present. The cost is modest (patience, labor, foregoing immediate answers), yet credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Milo’s motive—restoring light for Nara—drives every choice, and his “wistfully pragmatic” nature is dramatized in the quiet, competent repair work and the risky decision to bring her. Contradictory impulses (caution vs. necessary risk) surface in “protected vulnerability” as he guides her down the fire escapes. Interiority remains embodied and particular (objects, light, harbor mechanics), avoiding generic labels. The final stewardship choice credibly forecloses comfort for responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s motivation (“translate isolation into independence”) is clear and intensifies into the choice to leave, with embodied, character‑particular interiority (glyptodon kinship, stone hum through “bone strings”). The internal friction—comfort in lofty mist versus responsibility to witness—is credible if understated. Micro‑choices (descending to the circle, selecting “migrate,” tipping the sundial) align with values while exposing cost. Slightly low struggle-to-competence ratio keeps it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior is specific and credible: a ghostwriter who believes she “trafficked in hush” and worries about archiving before she relinquishes a letter. Her micro-choices (following rivulets, querying Arun, setting the boat on the coil) align with her conflict between secrecy and connection. The turn feels earned rather than declared. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims ambiguity but not depth.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mina’s motives are specific and consistent—prevent the tricksters’ feast by fostering unity—and her micro‑choices (rerouting transmitters, stalling Calvin) reveal priority and values under pressure. The relationship with Calvin adds a credible crucible with status dynamics. The visible cost is subtle but present (she forecloses institutional glory and risks alienating her mentor). Interiority is textured and embodied, though one or two moments verge on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aveline’s fear and prudence are dramatized through concrete choices (reciting primes, negotiating with space, using the compass) rather than labels. Her internal contradiction—panic vs. duty—acts in-scene and drives tactics. The final refusal to cast the key away reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost. A minor on-the-nose abstraction (“Order…mutiny could be reasoned with”) blunts otherwise embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Samara’s face-blind, hyper‑methodical mind is distinct and embodied (textures over faces, numbering breaths), and her micro‑choices (graphite tracing, summoning both suspects) align with her flaw. The internal shift—“a new sense arranging itself”—lands, though it skews tidy and low‑friction. Mercado adds light pressure but rarely forces a hard trade‑off. The emotional cost is mostly felt, not contested, keeping this just shy of high‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marla’s motive—honoring an ancestor—drives concrete choices: decoding the journals, sounding the buoy, and agreeing to exchange. Interiority is textured through embodied images (“spongey dread,” “practiced courage before a cracked mirror”). The final renunciation (loaning “tomorrow” and crossing) is earned by prior beats. A hair more friction between self-preservation and duty could have deepened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avery’s motives and micro-choices are clear and embodied: from pocketing the glass flake to decoding the scaffold’s rhythm and stepping beyond the guardrail. His “luminous disbelief” credibly shifts into action, and the music-as-agency choice feels specific to him. The cost is subtle but legible—exertion, vulnerability, and letting the hitchhiker go “into certainty.” Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliot’s motives are clear and particular—an inherited calm confronting loops of crime and commerce—enacted through small, revealing choices (placing bills, inviting analysis, choosing to “walk listening”). Interiority is specific and embodied (chains “in gentle applause,” bills as “whispered flags”), and the relationship with Mira adds pressure without melodrama. The internal contradiction—breaking loops vs. honoring markers—plays out credibly. Slight softness remains around tangible personal cost beyond conceptual renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motive is precise and persistent (decode inscriptions to prevent weaponization), and her grief/solitude versus outreach creates credible internal tension. Embodied details (sidereal clock, breath control, tears) ground emotion. The decisive vulnerability—broadcasting and inviting others—earns her shift. A slight safety in her competence keeps some messiness at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Inyara’s motives are precise (retrieve the seed and face what “no mirror reflects”) and her guilt over abandoning her sister drives contradictory impulses that act in scene. Micro‑choices under pressure—praising the apples, promising to bleed honesty, tracing circles while naming lost truths—reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance (unbend vs. break) is earned with a visible cost: releasing self‑punishment into the lake. Slight softening comes from the late vision of the sister alive, which eases—but does not erase—the price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and particular—renegotiating the covenant without erasing memory—and his contradictory impulses (“anxious elation” vs. hesitation before cutting) act in-scene. Micro‑choices (unwrapping, asking the question, deciding to carve the spiral) align with a plant‑listening worldview. The visible cost (pain, new scarring) earns the change. A slight mythic distance in diction keeps us a fraction removed from raw vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline and sustained: a reckless idealist barters her own future to revive her sister’s. Interiority is embodied (the “tremor behind her dusky resolve,” the ballast’s “bruise”) and contradicted by her instinctive lunge for the seed versus her fear. Micro-choices under pressure (offering more than memory, choosing the seed, accepting ballast) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The change—renunciation of her future—reads earned and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Gideon’s contradiction—armoring with technical facts while grief keeps leaking through—reads specific and embodied (cloth specs, tape width, union leverage). His choices track cleanly from motive: he comes for a paid task but really seeks meaning, and he chooses descent and restoration. The “confidently uncertain” trait plays on the page without tidy therapy-speak. Slight neatness in the final resolve trims the ceiling but remains earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aram’s motive—understanding transition to ease grief—drives every micro‑choice, from translating aloud to refusing to look at the presence. The contradiction between “haunted ambitions” and “kindly methodical” plays on the page (mapping threads while his chest tightens). His final stance—gratitude within continued absence—feels earned, with a felt cost of letting go of grasping. Minor note: struggle remains mostly internal, but it’s palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silence’s motive—preserving wonder by reminting “migrating identities”—is clear and embodied through concrete choices (opening the creel, singing contradictions). Her interior specificity (iron moonspring, pulse tied to phases) feels distinctive. However, the pressure on her is gentle; internal conflict and visible cost remain muted, so endurance reads serene rather than hard-won. The earned stasis at the end has grace but little sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Roan’s interiority is specific and embodied—the “resonant hush” of grief, the professional eye mapping bunkers to personal barricades, and the trembling confession land as credible contradictions. His key choice (to “crown” and then to confess) is motivated by earlier curiosity and loneliness seeded via the shell’s confessions. The cost—tears, admission of fear, and a reoriented mission—reads on the page. Slight tidiness in the final mission pivot keeps this just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation (truth‑seeking and self‑forgiveness) is clear and drives concrete choices—descending the hatch and working till dawn. Interiority is embodied and particular (“cotton from every sound,” “let the current read you back”) with credible contradiction (needs sting yet seeks forgiveness). Mara’s presence sharpens stakes without stealing agency; her guilt mirrors the narrator’s in a way that pressures action. The final shift reads earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear and persistent—she’s driven to find the library before the third letter closes the gate. Micro-choices reveal layered impulses: obeying silence at cost to agency, not checking the watch, and finally relinquishing it. Embodied tension (“heart trembling with cautious exuberance”) reads specific, not generic. The renunciation of the watch lands as a credible, earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive is clear and propulsive, and her micro‑choices under pressure (ignoring the roses’ warning; choosing to lift and then to “answer” the violin) reveal character. Embodied feeling (“mulberry ache”) and profession‑filtered noticing create a specific interiority. Internal contradiction—fear versus urgency—registers but remains modest; the cost to her personally is more anticipatory than paid. Still, the final turn to “plum hope” reads earned by the choices she makes.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysandra’s motive (“capture one last spark before oblivion”) is clear, embodied, and pressures every micro‑choice. The internal conflict is credible: she must balance on the “threshold of stillness” without rushing or lingering—each path threatens a real loss. Her competence is offset by risk and restraint, not perfection; the emerald’s fire is spent and a debt to the void is incurred. Secondary figures apply silent pressure without diluting her POV.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Simeon’s motive is precise and pressing: to test whether his forgiveness is complete and find contentment. Contradictory impulses (attachment to the hairpin/sister versus release) operate simultaneously in scene and culminate in a costly choice. Embodied perception (the hairpin’s chime, the tree’s shiver) grounds his interiority. The resolution forecloses a path—he surrenders the last tangible echo of his sister—with a felt cost scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear from the first lines (seeking a “conscience for hire” because the narrator’s own retired) and actions align—decoding chimes, climbing, listening, releasing the shard. Contradictory impulses (craving certainty while consenting to doubt) play out in scene, not summary. The fee constraint (“decide nothing until dawn”) credibly shapes behavior. The change—internalizing doubt and discarding the shard—reads earned with a modest, felt cost (foregoing verdict/payment).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s withholding pedagogy and Rowan’s hunger/discipline conflict are cleanly dramatized through concrete actions (chalk circle, “step inside only when you no longer wish to”). Rowan’s surrender is motivated and earns the cost of vanishing. Interiority is economical but specific; we feel Rowan’s impatience shading into surrender and Mira’s tempered authority. Minor distance remains—Rowan’s inner contradiction could deepen one more notch under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear, particular motive (“navigate without moving”) and embodied attention build a credible practitioner. The main tension—wielding power versus honoring balance—emerges late but lands in the renunciation to share rather than rule. Internal contradiction is present but mild; competence outpaces struggle, softening felt cost. Micro‑choices (tasting flint, planting the arrowhead) reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Felius’s desire “to find the sacred in the simple” is embodied through concrete, pressured choices (rejecting the quills, descending with the keystone, kindling the brazier). Interiority is specific and textured, with a credible flaw (underachievement) shaping tactics. The final shift—choosing lingering warmth over glittering genius—reads earned. Cost is present but soft (foreclosing machine‑made brilliance rather than suffering a starker loss).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Emil’s motive—discovering the color of sound—drives each choice, and his flaw (“hides behind truth”) is dramatized when his steps remain gray until he vows. Interiority is concrete (skeletal key tag, number seven door) and embodied through sensory synesthesia. The final vow marks a credible change with a felt cost: public vulnerability and surrender of secrecy. Minor note: his fear could tighten one earlier beat to heighten struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ikram’s duty-driven temperament, fear, and attraction to the prophecy coexist on the page, producing credible internal friction that culminates in a decisive choice. Micro-choices—the tactile handling of coins, trusting the bowl’s pulses, announcing departure—arise from established traits and history with static. The embodied hesitation (“heart wavered”) and the whispered vow at the end show cost and continuity. Slightly abstracted emotion at times prevents an even deeper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s fear/compulsion tension is embodied and specific, and micro‑choices (accepting the atlas, lifting the prism, speaking names) reveal values under pressure. The reaper’s grief reads through action (offering the page, collaborating) rather than label. The relationship evolves credibly from wary encounter to co‑naming. If any weakness, their inner moral cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orin’s motives are clear and particular—an earnest, lukewarm mage trying to mend a cosmic ledger through a broken bell’s silence. Contradictory impulses (“He dared not be lukewarm anymore, yet his magic answered only in tepid waves.”) act in scene and compel a costly choice (abandoning calculation; offering sweat). Embodied emotion (“palms trembling with brittle devotion”) stays specific. The ending reflects an earned adjustment of stance rather than a pat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motive to preserve resurfacing histories is vivid and particular, and her duty-versus-disobedience conflict culminates in the sluice choice. Interiority is embodied through tactile artifacts (photos, label) rather than labels. The cost is implied (professional risk/time theft) rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of top tier. Still, her hierarchy of values is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is crystalline and contradictory in-scene: she hungers for transformation yet fears the loss of tenderness, and her choice to “make a wick, not a conflagration” is earned by prior omens and costs. Embodied interiority (“cold on bark that sang faint notes of patience”) and memory-as-price reveal a specific person, not a type. Micro-choices (matching breath to starlings, trading memories) ladder to the final renunciation. Visible cost: deferred transcendence and the burden/pulse she must carry.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motive—preserving trust by redirecting violent pressure—drives concrete micro‑choices (breath cadence, leaf‑mapping, revised vectors). Embodiment is specific (buckle, bark biting gloves, muscle memory). A slight competence bias softens contradiction; doubt appears in Command’s hesitation more than in Mara’s interior conflict. Still, her restraint under pressure reads earned and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, compelling motive (defeat numbness) drives Mara’s micro-choices—rejecting weapons, arranging cushions, breathing in complement. Interiority is embodied (sweat, breath, tears-as-seeds) and contradictory (seeking conflict through stillness). The clones function as pressurizing facets of self with distinct stances (logic vs memory). Slight ease in the emotional pivot keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maren’s inventive pragmatism and hunger for “orthogonal approaches” are clear, and her micro‑choices (using brook water, venting the lid, sketching airflow tactics) align with that drive. The internal tension—need for hush versus the corpse flower’s notorious stench—renders a credible, character‑specific conflict. The final stance (to nurture and design with the seed, keep the sender secret) feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orren’s motive—coaxing back laughter—drives clear, tactic‑level choices (sequencing blowers, scattering leaves, selecting lullabies). Interiority is economical yet specific (“mournfully eager,” converses with the unspoken), though contradictions are implied more by diction than dramatized in choice. The upstairs family is off‑page pressure rather than a relationship crucible, fitting the scope. The final renunciation of noise into earned silence reads as a credible, paid stance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority: a “feral library guardian” torn between stray impulse and custodial duty. Micro‑choices (waiting, pocketing the pendant, declining to step through) align with the desire to “make friends with uncertainty.” Embodied emotion comes via tactile images (breath trade, ache behind ribs) rather than labels. The cost—refusing the doorway—is subtle but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Everard’s motive—vivify the crozier to reconfigure his fate—is precise and consistently pressures his choices. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. the “iron mask” of destiny; annihilation risk vs. attempt) act simultaneously in scene. His confessional peeling of the “mask of hopelessness” credibly earns the change with visible cost. Minor repetition of labels (“stoically sensitive”) brushes toward abstraction but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, consistent motivation and embodied perception (“glass sliding between heartbeats,” “struck quartz”) ground Mara’s choices. Competence is compelling, and the sacrifice of the artifact reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or missteps, so tension skews external. Still, her method and sacrifices feel character‑specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s motive and worldview are clear, embodied through tactile habits (polishing cleats, knot logic) and a decisive act (turning the hourglass). His resilient optimism reads as a functional flaw/strength, though internal contradiction is mild and he’s almost preternaturally competent under pressure. The moment of choosing alignments carries character specificity (“Knots teach you bridges between ends”). Some emotional costs surface (Rowan’s reconfigured past; passengers’ flicker), but Milo’s personal cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive is vivid and particular, and her micro-choices under pressure (inviting guests, mapping confessions, and especially cutting her own keystone thread) align with a rigorous, idiosyncratic mindset. The embodied calm (“patient beast deciding whether to breathe”) keeps her human and flawed. Internal contradiction (devotion to connection vs. risking harm) is present but could be sharpened at the moment of near-collapse. Still, the sacrifice registers as earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s vow to teach “whoever listened” and his penitent drive are clear, with concrete actions (forging the Horizon Knot, leading the dive) aligning to motive. Interiority is present but mostly via elevated exposition; genuine internal contradiction under pressure is light. Tarek’s quick, specific contribution adds texture but not deep relational pressure. The ending registers a credible shift in stance, though the emotional cost is more implied than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motive (protecting vulnerable voices) is clear and consistently enacted, with small but credible friction between fear and curiosity (“lungs tight” vs. descent). Micro‑choices—unhooking the chain, descending, bleeding her lantern power—align with a persistent‑listener trait. Interiority is concrete and filtered through sensory attention rather than labels. The internal conflict is modest in complexity, keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—crippling claustrophobia versus her vow to “stand by the unremembered”—are embodied in specific actions (counting heartbeats, clipping on the respirator, overriding safeties). Her perceptions are character‑particular (cables as “trapped eels,” silence with phase transitions). The return choice under time pressure reads as an earned endurance with cost. Minor note: the gold fleck’s personal stakes could bear one sharper emotional edge to heighten motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motives are precise and embodied: a heartbeat-counting survivor seeking “wisdom fetched from failure” who pays with her most painful recording. Internal contradiction (fear vs. resolve; anonymity vs. responsibility) operates in-scene, culminating in the choice to sacrifice the tape. Micro-choices (placing the shard, pressing PLAY) reveal values under pressure. The cost is felt and alters her stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, particular motivation (“translate texture into sound”) drives concrete choices—buying the diamond despite warnings, reading birds, embedding the stone, and reciting textures. Competence is vivid without feeling frictionless, and urgency surfaces as the language “dies” with his steps. Internal contradiction is lightly sketched (belief that madness is misheard music vs. the tunnel’s danger) but not deeply dramatized. The final endurance—accepting the sealed passage to save the language—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular (undercover researcher seeking the Loamling and his brother), with embodied micro‑choices: using the arrowhead as conductor, dialing the relay, and confessing resentments. The grief/resentment contradiction plays on the page and fuels the key choice to risk vulnerability. Emotional texture is specific (“petty resentments…like seeds for winter birds”). The change feels earned, though the ease of acceptance at the end trims some friction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elaine’s motive is lucid and embodied—fear versus purpose register in breath, bow, and the treason risk—and her micro‑choices (tuning to twilight, deploying the shell) reveal a coherent value hierarchy. Lio’s interiority is thinner but functional, with his counterbeats and chisel work credibly aligned to his guilt/resolution arc. The relationship forms a crucible through pulse‑signaling that forces bolder tactics. Slight limitation: the piece privileges lyric momentum over deeper contradiction within Lio.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lorin’s motive—healing broken promises—threads cleanly from backstory to on‑page micro‑choices (foil cloak, off‑map route, blank letter to the girl). Contradictory impulses (respectful gestures vs. rebellious tactics) are dramatized rather than told. The climactic act forecloses paths (no handoff, no hiding), with a conceptual risk accepted. Slightly soft cost visibility keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlo’s motive—“interpret silence as possibility”—is clear and enacted through specific craft choices (tapping cedar, forging chimes, choosing to sing). His internal conflict is subtle but present: he risks breaking his vow’s safety by singing “without fear.” Actions align with traits and escalate from attention to making to offering. The only softness is limited on‑page cost beyond vulnerability and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hollis’s motive (to find “where stories live”) drives tangible choices—chalk map, scarf placement, stepping through—and the refusal at the end reads as an earned renunciation. Interiority is specific and embodied (“cataloging” solitude; scent of paper pulp) without therapy‑speak. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is subtle rather than pressurized, with only a brief tension between duty to be visible and need for invisibility. Still, actions align convincingly with a sanely eccentric worldview and culminate in a credible endurance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Callix’s motive—duty to “shelve” the runaway dream—meets a counter‑impulse toward stewardship, and his mid‑scene pivot (lowering the brush, lifting the camera) dramatizes that internal contradiction. Emotions are embodied through professional ritual (tripod, palette, shutter) rather than label‑speak, keeping the character particular. The cost—relinquishing capture/ownership for guidance—reads credibly at his level of competence. Slight softness: he solves the core dilemma with relatively little personal risk or fray, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orin’s motive—freeing an idea bound by fear—is clear and embodied in precise, character‑specific actions (waiting for the first star, using breath instead of tools). His competence is compelling, but the lack of genuine struggle or contradiction (he meets no resistance beyond gentle fear-webs) trims depth. The gesture of leaving the hair shows values and restraint. Emotional texture is present, though the internal cost to him remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear want (recover memories) meets a concrete obstacle and prompts a credible risk shift (“when habits break” → barehand touch). Interiority is vivid and embodied (“prickle… like static”), and the final reciprocity choice reveals values with cost. Minor neatness in the near-total success of the recovery keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive (seeking reversal while serving sentence) and a credible contradiction (wins reversal yet chooses to stay). Embodied quirks (walking backward) inform tactics under pressure. Rafe reads distinct and earns agency; Harl is flatter, a functional antagonist. The final renunciation is earned by the mentorship bond established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orien’s motive—to preserve wonder—is clear and drives tangible choices (reciting fruit names, guiding the ribbon, grafting). Interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted; there’s little friction or contradictory impulse on the page. The partnership with Liora is harmonious, offering minimal relational pressure. The vow at the end suggests cost, but struggle is largely inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Neris’s motive (to calm/ground the spirit before the hush numbs everything) is clear and consistent, and her taboo choice to use the elders‑disliked method under pressure reads earned. Interiority is concrete and specific (tools, smells, the needle’s purpose) rather than label‑speak. A minor limitation: internal contradiction is hinted (taboo method, cost of recognition) but not deeply wrestled with on the page. The final renunciation—offering applause to the dead rather than the actor—lands as a credible, values‑driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Levin’s motives are clear and consistent—finish the mentor’s map and honor “interpret silence with empathy”—and his choices (pressing the wall, opening the grate, replacing it, refusing immediate playback) align under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific, with guarded curiosity shading his hesitations. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle; a sharper on‑page tug between ambition and restraint at the henge would deepen cost. Still, the final renunciation reads earned and character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority: the narrator’s rigor and grief braid into micro‑choices (silence on comms, severing the wire, requesting two more hours). Contradictory impulses—analytic patience vs. aching need—coexist credibly. The planned release of the snow globe forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor hedge: the “study” remains largely inward with little on‑page external pushback beyond Reyes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he “must build a mouth for silence”—and actions align with this duty under a ticking window. Interiority is embodied via tool‑use and color lexicon rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning to be heard vs. choosing invisibility), but conflict remains mostly principled rather than pressured. The ending’s renunciation (sealing the song, leaving unrecognized) lands as earned stasis with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority with a live contradiction—curiosity versus respect—drives the mid‑scene choice to read and the closing risk to quote. Embodied detail (goggles fogging, fingers on brass) grounds emotion. The status dynamic with Auden shifts credibly from servant/master to tentative peers. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with exile risk and ethical trespass acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eira’s motive—to prove that absence remembers—is clear and steadily pressures her choices from categorizing clouds to slicing the ballast and, finally, choosing to fall. Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (ozone‑scented ink, “temperatures of longing”). The renunciation at the end (transmitting data, then stepping out) is costly and earned by her beliefs and the accumulative signs of letting go. The one softness is the speed with which she accepts death, though the accumulative logic mostly earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motivation (to craft sky beyond likeness) drives decisive choices: accepting the warden’s offer quickly, blindfolding to paint by nonvisual senses, persisting under the demolition clock. Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (textures of sound/temperature as cognition), though internal contradiction under pressure is modest. Competence sometimes smooths struggle, but the commitment to non‑sight in a high‑risk window shows credible cost. The final endurance/stance is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aleksei’s drive to “chart the next great discovery” is clear and enacted through specific, tactile choices (kneeling, brushing grit, logging squares). Interiority is character‑particular (polyglot phrasebook as talisman; “sociable isolation” as credo). The relationship with Mirelle adds subtle pressure and trust stakes without crowding the POV. Internal conflict is light, but his solitude vs. need to be heard shades the final stance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selene’s drive “to learn the rhythm of repair” is clear and embodied in concrete choices: climbing, seeking prophecy, confessing to the mirror, assembling the clock. The apology at the mirror carries felt cost and reveals a flaw (rushed locks, mistakes) that she must face. Interiority is specific and sensory rather than abstract. A touch more contradiction in-the-moment (hesitation vs compulsion) could deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, evolving motivation (protect the arches/community) drives concrete choices: hesitation before ringing, then a gentler second ring reframed as promise. Interiority is specific (sap/ozone hush; chalk humming inside), with a credible fear that pricks “thorns” into optimism. The relationship with Serafin meaningfully pressures action without dialogue, revealing values under strain. Slight safety: the protagonist rarely risks a personal loss beyond social credibility and exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive—mercy via a gentler cadence—drives clear micro‑choices under pressure (aligning the puppet head, revealing the key, sacrificing her heartbeat). The internal contradiction (duty vs. compassion) is specific and acts in scene. The cost (relinquishing her heartbeat) reads on the page and reconfigures her stance. Slight safety in her competence is offset by credible risk and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s reluctance and hidden vow create a credible contradiction that drives choice. Her agency is clear in assembling the model, using light to redirect birds, and choosing quiet anonymity at the end. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“salt and rust,” “sweat”), not abstract. Minor softness: intuition finds the socket a bit conveniently, reducing felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Talitha’s motives (atonement and reconnection) are clear and embodied through specific choices—following the river, crafting nutrient films, releasing swans, sending the text. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (polymer/music cognition shaping perception). Contradictory impulses register (guilt vs. hope; control vs. letting go) and resolve in an earned, modest act with cost. The absence of Mara on the page limits relationship‑pressure, but the crucible is still felt through Talitha’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kes’s motive—to locate the place where stories begin—drives each choice, with a credible tension between vendor/profiteer and seeker. Interiority is concrete through tool handling (stylus, bottled moonlight) and time pressure (parole). The final renunciation—choosing not to mark the slate—reads as an earned stance shift with conceptual cost. Slight distance remains: emotion is largely sublimated into imagery rather than embodied strain.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kilor’s motive and method are concrete and character‑particular, and his decision to offer himself reads as an earned renunciation after discovering remorse can only be redistributed. Sel’s guilt and fear of water provide a credible counter‑pressure and status dynamic. Interiority is conveyed through sensory idiom (flavor as emotion), avoiding generic labels. The only minor soft spot is the speed of Kilor’s pivot to sacrifice, though it aligns with his ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysandra’s motives are clear and embodied—“empathetically decisive” shows in risking the clock for the elevator’s voice. Her micro‑choices (stealing the weight, multilingual repair) reveal values under pressure. The cost (crippling a bell) exposes a real tradeoff rather than savior smoothness. Slightly limited contradiction—she rarely wavers—keeps this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhea’s motive—custodianship of abandoned dreams—drives concrete choices (modifying the mirror, following the light corridor, vowing not to plunder). Her fear/curiosity tension is embodied (“fear brushed… curiosity pushed harder”), and her chaotically precise mind shows in the fiber alignment. The renunciation at the end feels earned by the earlier vow and discoveries. Cost is conceptual (risk of redrawing her past; giving up possession) but present.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained (retrieve “forgotten combinations”/seeds), with competent, specific micro-choices under pressure. Interiority carries a crisp perceptual signature (“prism‑minded”), balancing anticipation with methodical cool. Internal contradiction is present but light; stakes never force a painful moral trade, limiting depth. The felt cost is mostly situational (time/entrapment) rather than psychologically fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is precise and embodied—Lark’s reverent craft and “empathy in motion” drive each micro‑choice. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets little resistance beyond self‑imposed restraint, so the arc leans toward competence rather than conflict. The tactile analysis of stress cracks reveals character through action. The final renunciation of speech registers but with limited felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tomas’s motives (to redeem exile by discovering “beauty in the difficult”) drive concrete micro‑choices at the board, especially resisting greed when the stakes tug. Contradictory impulses—ambition vs. grace, fear vs. poise—are active in scene and culminate in the queen sacrifice. Interiority is specific (worry stone, “translating silence”) and embodied. The cost is felt and character‑particular without safety hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is crystalline (recover the diary intact to advance his silence-catalog and heal with Oriel), and actions align with his pacifist, theatrical ethos. Interiority is specific and embodied through acoustic craft and the naming of silences, with a credible contradiction between scientific cataloging and unresolved grief. The micro‑choices (which fork, when to pause, whether to open) reveal values hierarchy without tidy over‑explanation. The shift to forgiveness is earned by prior beats; only a slight neatness to the epiphany tempers a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motive is vivid and particular, rooted in a sensorial, vocation‑shaped hunger that coheres with every choice. Her micro‑choices (accepting the elders’ condition, planting with “dried tears,” adopting breath as tactic) reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but soft—resolve vs communal fear—so the cost feels more moral than visceral. Still, the earned renunciation (deferring the physical bloom) lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ryn’s goal and values are clear and consistent, and his choices under time pressure reveal competence without hedging. Interiority is present but skewed toward mission-focus; contradictory impulses are minimal. The oath vs. risk tension flickers but never bites deeply. Still, the final act—seizing and deploying the spear amid inversion—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, competent motivation (“cultivate foresight in action”) drives concrete choices, and her occupational lens colors perception. Interiority is specific but cool; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, which softens the felt cost. The micro‑choices (climbing, bagging, deploying fans, sealing the site) align with character. Emotional embodiment is restrained but coherent with her disciplined temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Harmona’s motive—unfettering the hush to “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (which bell when; when to advance; when to braid all three) align with that aim. Interiority is filtered through synesthetic perception, giving her a distinct inner texture. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely doubts or pays an overt emotional cost beyond concentrated effort. The competence-forward arc reads strong but a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kalen’s drive (“to harvest insights from failure”) is embodied through concrete, pressured choices—climbing, planting driftwood, stepping into the theft vision, and modulating the melody. The internal contradiction—obsession that once engineered failure vs. a new stance toward reconciliation—surfaces cleanly when he recognizes himself as the thief and changes the music. Emotions are embodied via tactile ritual (uncasing the flute, breath control) rather than labels. The final renunciation of grasping (“quiet gratitude rather than clutching desperation”) reads earned with a felt cost to his former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dreya’s motives are vivid and particular—translate the astronomer’s grief via her press—and her micro‑choices (mirrors instead of type; the final ambiguous line; flinging the sheet) reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction (yearning to “solve” emotion vs fear that quantification kills empathy) culminates in an earned renunciation. Embodied feeling (“numbers that smelled of pine and grief,” bruised ribs) keeps her from abstraction. Slight softness: her high competence faces little resistance beyond the vanishing‑stars clock.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tren’s jittery temperament, devotion to Ilya, and fear of the relic’s “lure” create credible, embodied tension that culminates in a principled relinquishment. Interiority is specific (triplet drumming, knees jittering) and enacted through micro-choices (performing wonder in the tavern; unclasping the pendant). The contradiction—desire to coax wonder vs. duty/fear—stays active in scene. The renunciation carries a clear, felt cost (payment/mission/identity) scaled to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilara’s motive (to prove objects absorb emotion) is clear and drives every micro‑choice, from choosing predawn to reading frost and addressing the prism with “truthful lies.” Her interior conflict—mediator vs. confessor—surfaces at the shame/joy swell and culminates in accepting responsibility. Embodiment (“toes gripping the quartz”) grounds emotion credibly. The cost is conceptual but legible: she’ll carry peril and proof back to the guild.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation is crystalline—send the mother’s laugh to the orphaned boy—and every action aligns with that purpose. Embodied cost appears in aging “a season” per shuttle and the eventual hearing loss/death. Internal contradiction is muted; she accepts the sacrifice early, so tension derives more from endurance than vacillation. Still, specificity of craft choices under pressure reveals character with economy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ellan’s motivation and temperament (meek, quietly determined) cleanly drive choices: repairing the hoist, bartering his father’s laugh, then leading communal rebuilding. Interiority is succinct but felt—his end‑beat ache and vow ground the cost. Contradictory impulses (timidity vs. leadership) are present though lightly rendered. The emotional throughline stays legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation (the “weight of a withheld truth”) is clear and intensifies into a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular through synesthetic perception, with a real conflict between obedience and curiosity crystallized at the end. The label “cyclically spontaneous” edges toward on‑the‑nose, but it’s dramatized via timing pressure and synchronized cycles. The final choice to conceal feels earned and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ellis’s reticence is dramatized through tactile, telling choices—climbing despite dread, decoding “protect,” arranging a reply cairn, and naming the glass “Anchor.” His contradictory impulses (urge to speak vs. savoring hush) surface credibly at the end. Interiority is embodied (matches, breathlike darkness, the ache in his ribs) and distinct. Secondary pressure from Marla/Joel is light but functional, keeping focus on Ellis’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mora’s contradictory impulses—caution learned from “inkless letters” versus hunger to shape dawn—are dramatized through tactile choices (inviting the herald, inserting and rotating the wick). The embodied cost (“relieved and condemned”) lands and reconfigures her stance. The herald functions as pressure rather than foil, but their brief partnership reveals motive and value hierarchy. Emotional texture leans lyric over visceral at times, but it remains character‑specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (to learn why stories magnetize) drives concrete choices: seeking the elder, sacrificing the wing, attempting the risky pigment, and performing the piece. Interiority is embodied (the donor heart’s “muted thunder,” the story tugging her sternum). The internal tension between attraction to stories and fear of being “crushed” gives her choices stakes. Final stance—a gentler “listening” art—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eron’s motive—curiosity about what trees witness versus duty to the labyrinth—is clear and drives concrete micro‑choices (threshold pause, chalk mapping, presenting the sextant). His interiority is specific and embodied, not generic. The renunciation at the end (setting aside the mop as the labyrinth simplifies) reads as a credible cost to identity. Slight softness: he solves the core problem with minimal internal friction once the chamber opens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motives are clear (rekindle the realm, find the pane) and tested when the lattice reflects her failures. The internal conflict between control and communal tangle culminates in the costly choice to tear the logbook and sing. Embodied emotion (“warm braid around my ribs”) grounds the lyricism. The renunciation of archivist rigidity for collective song reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lowell’s contradictory impulses—“decided to go… not to join… but to unearth wisdom” and later the urge to “clutch the book and remain underground” vs feeling the streets’ heartbeat—are active in scene and resolve credibly. Motivation flows from a specific wound (the miscalculated transit) and his empathy. The final renunciation (“hide no longer”) carries a felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (naming, cataloging, and gently countering “ordinary horrors”) are specific and enacted through tactile micro‑choices: seedballs into seams, waiting to ask, offering the relic‑bread. The guilt vs. action tension sharpens in his confession and in Madam Ko’s counter of “roots do not require certainty.” The relationship dynamic is quiet but legible—she with status via ritual, he with humility and craft—and it alters his stance. The closing vow feels earned, though pressure remains soft rather than bruising.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quillan’s meticulousness motivates every action, from calipers and tuning forks to the final inscription, and his internal conflict (oath to preserve vs. fear of volatile memory/guilt) sharpens under pressure. Recognition of Lyra and the omitted vow creates a credible fracture that drives the peak choice. Emotions are embodied (breath like ground diamonds, lungs turning to shards) without therapy-speak. The Earned Stasis at the end—archiving the vow with cost—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clara’s goal and values are clear and consistent, and her embodied unease (“watch fob…tapping her sternum”) grounds motivation. Contradictory impulses—stealth vs. the need to break the hush with “Truce”—surface under pressure. Her status play with Cinder via the fob reveals lived hierarchy and history. The endurance at the end (vow) feels earned, with a quiet cost in forgoing certain paths (violence, bravado).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.7)
    Zephra’s motivation (skeptical inquiry) is clear and enacted through specific micro‑choices: following the taste‑compass, approaching Lior, proposing the council address. Interiority is vivid via synesthetic taste shifts and the flicker of unspoken companionship. However, internal conflict remains gentle; she faces little risk or contradiction beyond tonal hesitation. The evolution from skeptic to “questioning forward” lands but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive (uncorking blocked creativity) drives concrete micro-choices: waiting for laughter to cease, fixing the lock, deciding to forget, and drawing from longing rather than recall. The internal contradiction—mnemonic perfection as both gift and shackle—manifests in action, not label. Grief via Mara anchors embodied emotion without therapy‑speak. The self-sequestration at the end reads as a credible, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cressida’s motive—seeking honesty and the fate of lost letters—is consistent and propulsive, with embodied sensitivity (“wilted near dishonesty”) that informs choices. Her candor under pressure with Fen humanizes her and shapes tactics. Internal contradiction is mild (fear of poison vs. stronger aversion to lies), keeping complexity short of the highest tier. The final act—risking exposure to plant truths—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Arlen’s motives are clear and embodied: he listens “with the whole cage of his ribs,” repairs the hinge by heartbeats, and then etches instructions to cede stewardship. His seasonal muteness imposes real constraint and generates inventive nonverbal responses (winding the sculpture, demonstrating to the council). Internal contradiction is subtler—competence versus the admission of limits—but it culminates credibly in the decision to share the map. The emotional texture is specific without therapy‑speak, though a sharper on‑page moment of reluctance before etching could deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motivation (caretaking and memory-keeping) intensifies under pressure, with credible internal friction between duty, fear, and the desire to quiet the “static.” Embodied interiority via polymer hands, coral patterns, and resin secretion grounds emotion in action. The final acceptance—“fragmented wholeness”—reads earned by prior choices and cost. Slight safety in competence (few mistakes) keeps the arc from hitting a messier high.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marisol’s dual motive (heal through listening, solve the mailbox mystery) drives concrete, pressure-tested choices, especially inviting public unlocking “among witnesses.” Mr. Cardoza’s fear-driven padlock and trembling reveal give credible vulnerability and cost. Interiority is largely earned through action and image rather than abstract labels. A slightly tidier emotional path for Marisol (few contradictions) keeps it just shy of stellar.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motive and worldview (“encrypt vulnerability as strength”) are specific and consistently enacted, and her micro‑choices (dice on plinth, dance‑firmware of mercy, sparing Vane with a die) reveal values under pressure. The interiority is tactile and character‑particular, though conflict skews toward high competence with minimal friction. The brief Vane encounter adds status history but resolves quickly, limiting relational crucible depth. A small note of doubt (“whispered… remain silent”) helps, yet contradiction remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kerrin’s motive—to recover vanishing memories—drives every choice from entering the whale to prying the salt coffin. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (lantern craft, wick‑knives, obedience to the harbor vs. her private quest). The decisive act (exhuming her earliest self) earns the later steadiness. Minor shortfall: the internal contradiction could tighten further at the lid‑pry beat with a sharper moment of doubt or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear motive (hush the prophecy) drives concrete choices, and his competence reads earned through ritual precision. Interiority is conveyed via tactile acts (smoothing hush, fingertip tracing ripples) more than thought, which keeps it specific but limits contradictory impulse on the page. The nearest tension—cosmic temptation to speak—registers in the sky more than inside him, softening felt struggle. The final endurance/renunciation feels credible and costs him the dangerous power he extracts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, specific motive (“to learn the language of old buildings”) drives concrete choices—moving in under a polite lie, committing to midnight lessons, accepting the burden at the end. The narrator’s contradictions (truth-seeking via lies) are dramatized, not told. Selin’s courteous secrecy and draining cost under pressure read as lived. A slight limit: the narrator’s inner conflict at the accusation beat could push further before the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—an archivist‑skeptic compelled to test and name magic—and the conflict between archiving and carrying drives micro‑choices (placing the shell; accepting the memory). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with embodied pulls (“ribbon of unexamined yearning”) against discipline. The final renunciation (not shelving the memory) forecloses a path with felt cost. A few lines edge toward tidy self‑explanation, but they don’t undercut the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is crystalline—pardon the mentor, rewrite the edict—and actions align under pressure. The self-forgiveness beat (“He pressed the thorn…”) lands with embodied cost and reframes his treason as mercy. Internal contradiction (treason vs. absolution; competence vs. survivor’s guilt) is present if understated. The piece leans toward hyper-competence, with little wobble or degradation under duress, trimming the top end.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silva’s motive—retain agency while understanding why people “echo”—is clear and intensifies, culminating in a negotiated pact with visible cost. Interiority is specific (fear of becoming a “communal well”), and actions align with that fear. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. dread) operate in scene, especially at the descent and in the chamber. Minor note: the merchant is a light pressure source, vanishing quickly, leaving Silva largely self-propelled.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s vocation and motive are vivid and consistent, and her key choices (confronting the monks, directing the globe’s placement) align cleanly with her traits. Interiority is image-led but specific (“quiet seamstress, stitching the shards she found”). The main soft spot is limited internal contradiction; she encounters little genuine doubt or degradation under pressure. The social cost of offending the monks registers, but her arc feels more assured than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hai-rin’s motive—to seek hidden patterns and honor hidden effort—drives concrete micro‑choices (answering the whistle, descending, reading tea foam, proposing the water‑net). The “demure audacity” provides a credible contradiction (modesty vs. bold initiative). Emotional embodiment is present but the felt cost of his stance remains gentle rather than pressurized. Relationship dynamics with Zhen are clear, though largely collaborative rather than crucible‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, compelling motivation (debunker seeking truth) deepens into a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is specific to her skills and worldview (cataloging dust, hum, and papers) and her choice to protect rather than publish lands as earned. Minor aphoristic lines verge on thesis, but they fit her professional bias. The final endurance—taking Hollis’s watch—forecloses an alternate future for her.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orrin’s conviction and tactics (tuning dials, beaming coordinates, training Elara) align with his stated aim, and Elara’s reluctance to “lead” adds a credible tension resolved through song-as-leadership. Interiority is largely carried by image rather than explicit thought, but it remains character‑specific. The relationship functions under pressure (tea under coils, lever sequences learned together), though contradictions are understated rather than dramatized in live conflict. The final endurance on the roof reads earned, with the risk of the storm as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motive—to translate between generations—drives concrete choices (selecting the jar, filling the box, presenting it, and releasing it). Interiority is specific (“positively wistful,” “lonesome splendor”), and his read on the family (“the way sailors read clouds”) is character‑particular. Internal contradiction (yearning for redemption vs. acceptance of loneliness) is present but remains gentle rather than pressure‑tested. Secondary characters apply relevant pressure through grief and curiosity, prompting his pivotal acts.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive (protect the relic) is clear and embodied through precise, profession‑tinted choices (wiring the beacon, plotting resonance paths). Her “logically emotional” contradiction is dramatized rather than told—she trusts evidence yet feels frequencies reading her ribs. The relationship with Callix functions as a crucible, prompting adaptation and a belief shift without sentimentality. The primary cost lands more on Callix than Mara, slightly limiting depth of her personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, distinctive motives drive both narrator and mapper; the narrator’s impatience meets the mapper’s discipline in concrete actions (tuning fork detours, rod placement). Interiority is specific and embodied (“shivered…like a tent of silence”), and the vow at the end credibly forecloses a prior path. The main limitation is low friction: the narrator consents quickly and faces little pushback beyond temperament. Still, the earned internal turn from urgency to “promises” lands.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive is clear and steadily intensifies: expose Havel to reclaim agency. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“wet iron,” measured water depth), and the curiosity-vs‑protocol conflict lives in action. She adapts under pressure (crawling under the gate, leveraging the jack) without becoming superhuman. The final stance—carrying the memories forward—reads as earned endurance with a modest but felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maeve’s deliberateness and embodied craft under pressure feel lived-in, with a credible flicker of doubt (“uncertainty wedge”) complicating competence. Arden’s gentled urgency and vocation-specific bearing create a clear relational dynamic that shapes choices. Micro‑choices (accepting the risky repair; offering her own “second opinion”) reveal a hierarchy of values. The only limitation is that Maeve’s internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s curiosity and irreverent awe translate into concrete, risky action (bargaining with acid, firing the arrow into the newborn bell). Motivation is consistent and embodied; the “pioneering cart glider” identity informs her mischief-first calculus. Internal tension—safety vs. wonder—is present but subtle rather than deeply dramatized. The closing choice feels earned through prior micro‑choices and process losses (ten prototypes).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s motive (find where deleted files go; give closure) is clear and consistent, sharpening under pressure when policy threatens her choice. The internal conflict—duty to corporate preservation vs forbidden curiosity/justice—registers, though it isn’t deeply layered. Embodied beats (heart pounding, gloves/visor work) reveal character through action. The final renunciation (broadcasting despite legal risk) feels earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s calmly intuitive vigilance and self-doubt create a credible engine for pursuit and choice; her decision to “finish the map together” crystallizes a stance shift. Embodied cues (boots skidding, iron rungs with rime) keep emotion physical. The relationship with Silas adds light pressure but is brief. Cost is more conceptual than personal, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motive—to study the acoustics of endings before choosing death—is precise and drives each micro‑choice (volunteering, listening, stepping outside). Her interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (parasol tip’s whistle, ice as “plural accents of endings”). The Earned Stasis at the end—postponing the clinic—feels causally earned and carries cost. Minor note: “grips reality loosely” is more tonal than action‑constraining on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motivation (work-seeking translator) meets a credible, value-testing counteroffer; interiority is embodied (“breath clouds like spilt milk”), and micro‑choices accrue (accepting conversation, naming mismatches, accepting apprenticeship). Contradictory impulses—wages vs. meaning—are staged and resolved at a felt cost. The sentinel’s actions reveal character through restraint and guardianship rather than exposition. Change at the end reads earned by prior beats rather than bestowed.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation to preserve rather than proclaim is clear and coherently embodied through ritual choices (conjuring stillness, delaying the opening). Interiority is particular and sensory-driven (“reading a library” of sand), though internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or strains. The renunciation cost (anonymity, carrying the weight without speaking) lands but could sharpen with one moment of temptation. Actions align with a disciplined temperament, yielding a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motive and method are precise and embodied—she arranges photographs by smile‑arcs and invites reconfiguration—but internal conflict is muted and resistance minimal. Her “perceptively calm” stance enables others’ revelations credibly. The micro‑choices (pinning, sequencing, inviting the crowd to rearrange, then sketching the mural) track cleanly with motive. The cost is soft—more held risk than jeopardy—tempering peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orrin’s motive—decode growth before language ossifies—drives concrete choices (unwrapping the crystal, inviting the tribunal to hold it). Interiority is embodied through sensory focus (hush as pressure, chimes in facets) rather than label-speak. The reticence vs. public demand for “clear prose” provides a believable tension. The one soft spot is limited internal contradiction at the peak; his calm feels a touch untested given the tribunal’s threat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (to capture the sound of aging) drives concrete choices (recording, replaying, accepting the marrow lesson). The prophet exerts pressure through forgetful foresight that complicates the attempt. The narrator’s final renunciation is earned and bears cost (losing the tape’s promise, entering deeper uncertainty). Relationship dynamics are evocative if slightly one-channel, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eloi’s motivation and competence are clear and character‑particular; his shift from mending cameras to “cosmos” is embodied in precise choices (asking for shutters, a gyroscopic ring, notebook string). Internal ambivalence surfaces (“flattered and terrified”) but the conflict remains gentle; he never truly falters under pressure. The relationship with Rhea adds real, immediate pressure yet stays collegial, not adversarial. The earned renunciation is subtle—he refuses to dominate the hand, choosing to “let it listen”—but the personal cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives are clear and consistently rooted in “decisive kindness,” and her micro‑choices (borrowing the shard, building the track, approaching Mateo silently) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is shown through sensory attention rather than abstract labels, with embodied perception guiding action. The weakness is limited internal contradiction—Mara rarely falters—yet the hospice time pressure supplies credible stakes. Hector and Mateo’s brief on‑page presence still shifts status dynamics credibly at the bedside.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orin’s motive and temperament are clear and tested: ambition vs. being used, answered by a third‑way choice that foregrounds mercy. His micro‑choices (blood on the key, then offering trust) reveal hierarchy of values with cost (foregoing the sarcophagus, risking exile). Vela’s pressure is credible and shifts status when she must join him, altering their relationship. Interiority is specific and embodied (“equations settle inside his chest like birds”), not label‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” conflict is dramatized in micro-choices (nodding permission, taking the heart, vowing to “track that yearning”) and culminates in an earned shift to “earned wonder.” Kedron’s competence and “lineage” read true but remain lightly tested; his fear is forgiven rather than confronted. The emotional cost is present but modest; the pair succeed without a hard sacrifice. Still, motives are consistent, embodied, and drive action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks “light without fire”—and her micro‑choices (selecting the crescent, escalating the polish, deciding to offer rather than keep) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile action and sense detail. The internal conflict (attachment vs. offering) is present but lightly contested rather than pressured. Still, the renunciation lands credibly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s “quietly proactive” ethos drives concrete choices—mapping icicle dots, summoning Rowan, harvesting resin, proffering the pendant—revealing values under pressure. Rowan’s tremor-to-action shift via work reads embodied and credible. Contradictory impulses (Mara’s watchfulness vs. intervention; Rowan’s shame vs. participation) coexist. The cost—risking exposure and relinquishing the pendant—lands without moral tidying.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Declan’s desire to break his cynicism and find a living ending is concrete, embodied by the seashell habit, the climb, and the mirror choice. Contradictory impulses—tidal despair vs. curated hope—act simultaneously and resolve in a credible renunciation. Micro‑choices (summoning, accepting tokens, ascending, pressing the shell to glass) track his values. The cost is vulnerability and the foreclosing of the self‑protective cynical draft path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orin’s desire to revive the Arbor Heart is clear and consistent, and his agency drives the ritual from setup to payoff. The small tension between mechanic (gears, phonograph) and lore (songs, stories) gives him dimension. However, interior contradiction under pressure is minimal; he rarely doubts or falters. The piece favors external lyricization over embodied, conflicted interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    Arren’s motive—translating heartbeats into maps—is clear and embodied through breath-counting, object placement, and the sealing act. Interiority is conveyed via tactile patience and ritual precision rather than abstract labels. The visible costs (endurance, refusal to blink, surrendering the safekept starlight) ground his resolve. Limited explicit internal contradiction keeps the character arc more steady than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s patient, listening temperament motivates every choice, and his vow to “store wonder in the cellar of reason” coheres with his craft-based approach. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“listened for echoes, not clicks”). The internal contradiction (rational custody of wonder vs. surrender to awe) remains subtle, so cost reads more as endurance than rupture. Still, micro-choices across dawn/noon/dusk reveal a stable hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Olivine’s motive—collecting the weights of burdens—is clear and particular, and her competence is balanced by the trap of her own unmeasured burden. The internal contradiction (she welcomes boundary blur until it traps her) feels earned and drives the pivotal turn. Embodied beats like “a yank behind her sternum” and fingers threatening to calcify ground emotion. The final choice to measure and braid her own burden forecloses avoidance with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motive—to transmute grief into form—is concrete and consistent, with embodied choices (raising the ash blank, refusing to “finish” the sculpture) revealing values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“Stay” vs. accepting “here and gone”) operate in scene rather than as summary. The remembered instruction “breathe earlier” grounds her tactic credibly. Minor hedge: she succeeds with little visible struggle after the freeze, but the cost of acceptance is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marlo’s motive (direction through bargaining with his ghost) is clear and sustained, and his hesitation at “contaminating the cavity” with regret shows a live contradiction resolved by choosing to surrender the stolen fragments. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (boots unsure of chronology; rust on notebooks). The final change—carrying stories rather than stealing—feels earned by prior beats. Slight thematic baldness in lines stating the bargain prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Milo’s motive (to “puzzle out new equations for hope”) is clear and enacted through concrete, expert micro‑choices. His steadied “stoic wonder” resists easy uplift, and the moment he orients planters by sextant shows character revealed under pressure. Internal contradiction (neither hopeful nor cynical) is credible but lightly pressed, so the felt cost is modest. Actions and reactions consistently spring from his engineer’s mindset without safety‑hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—making peace with an abandoned dream—is clear and deepens credibly through sensory attention and small, revealing choices (placing but not fixing the minute hand). The internal conflict between craft and silence is embodied rather than labeled, with the mother/thunder memory sharpening his values under pressure. The renunciation at the end forecloses a path with felt cost yet honors his temperament. Minor note: one line states the insight a touch too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clear from the first line and sharpened by the “architecture of lies” aim; the choice to salvage, then to copy rather than flee, reveals values under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (trickster lineage, misdirection as ethic). The risk vs. witness tension (“vanish like last night’s fog” vs. tie the box, copy, deliver) provides credible contradiction. The cost is felt conceptually and socially, even if bodily harm isn’t enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, consistent motivation (preserving ancient methods) drives Sera’s choices, and her patience is dramatized through waiting, decoding, and the final vow. Interiority is concrete and particular (“I believed patience could coax truth out of silence”). The lack of pronounced internal contradiction keeps it shy of the top band, but endurance-as-choice lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Holt’s vocation and hunger are specific and consistent, and his agreement to bind his craft to Selene’s secrecy is a credible, values‑revealing choice. The princess’s desire “to be seen entire” under a regime of disappearance gives the dialogue quiet pressure. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—curiosity versus professional detachment could be sharper under strain. Still, micro‑choices (composing aloud, accepting the thread, reframing his task) land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Oriven’s motives are clear and intensify: from sleepless yearning to decisive acts—prying the doors, storytelling into the gyroscope, choosing descent. Contradictory impulses (“dread and promise,” “bitterly sweet defiance”) appear in‑scene and inform choices. Embodied emotion (“heart knocked,” trembling hands) grounds the lyric texture. Slight archetype sheen remains, but micro‑choices under pressure earn the final renunciation of altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maia’s interior conflict—firefighter versus arsonist’s daughter—drives every choice, embodied in the scar and the evidence sand. Micro-choices (unbuttoning the cuff, threading the coin over the scar, the vow) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The resolution feels earned and costly (forgiveness without erasing responsibility). A slight tidiness in the final assertions keeps it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurin’s motive is clear and persistent (free the fountains’ memories before winter), and his skepticism meaningfully complicates and colors tactics rather than staying a label. Interiority is concrete (“skepticism was only a candle; memory needed sunrise”) and actions align under pressure (bell‑mimicking winds, following moisture). Internal contradiction—doubt as honesty vs. commitment to act—registers, though the felt cost of letting doubt “blink off” is more lyrical than bruising. Novara’s brief presence adds pressure without hijacking the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elinon’s motive—share light without fire—is clear and governs her tactics, and her mid‑scene realization that “pure calm might seal those loops” generates a credible internal conflict. The decisive micro‑choice to misalign the gear is motivated and reveals hierarchy of values (mercy over control). Embodied pressure is mostly conceptual; we feel little bodily or situational duress, keeping the arc slightly cushioned. Still, her competence is balanced by a sober acceptance that “change can bruise,” which lands a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Len’s motive—to render the town’s collective grief—drives concrete choices (retracing processions, listening to ribbon, carving a porous monument). Interiority is particular and embodied (“fiercely meditative,” chisels ringing with “unstruck music”). The relationship with Harrah adds human pressure and texture without hijacking the arc. A minor limitation is the low degree of on‑page internal contradiction; he proceeds with steady purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s ethically compulsive precision drives concrete micro-choices (cataloging wrong seconds; stopping the weights; the confession) under rising pressure. Contradictory impulses—duty to communal time vs. private guilt, protecting Clara vs. telling the truth—coexist and sharpen at the fault-line inscription. The final choice carries a visible cost: relinquishing the lie that preserved a mother’s comfort. Interiority is vivid and embodied through tools and environment, not label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s motives are legible and escalate: from curiosity and duty to a charged compulsion to complete the tapestry and surface buried intentions. Interiority is concrete (the whistle snagging, the “beetle” heart), and the choice to heed whispers instead of resisting lands as character-specific. The resist/comply tension is present but lightly priced; the cost feels more conceptual than personal risk. Still, his decisions drive every turn and are consistent with the “gardener who never learned to fear.”

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Estra’s motives are clear and consistent: avert unrest by seeding innovation via constrained, data‑driven futurity. The grounded/imaginative tension is dramatized in her refusal of mysticism and her 30‑word constraint. Interiority is specific (pulse synced to gears; “sacred instant”) with purposeful micro‑choices. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, so contradiction under pressure remains subtle rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mila’s drive—to resurrect stories—grounds every choice, and her occupational specificity (copyist habits, “rosin-scented fingers”) gives her credible agency. Interiority is present through action rather than abstract labels, and micro-choices (following the lyric’s directions, humming A, deciding to cloak) reveal her values. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so cost reads more conceptual than felt. The exhaustion beat and risk from “hounds of silence” hint at price but don’t fully bite emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motive is concrete and pressurized (to crystallize a fleeting emotion), and his micro‑choices—powdering shards, nearly donning the mask, then suspending it—reveal real internal contradiction. The mentor’s maxim creates a credible check on his impulse to reveal himself, complicating his tactics. Embodied detail (ash on palms, trembling breath) grounds the emotions. The final renunciation carries felt cost: the sight “threatens to stitch old griefs anew,” and he turns away.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corvin’s motives (preserve method over myth) drive concrete choices—leaving the sewer, engaging Mara, choosing the descent. His abrasive calm wavers (“doubt seep in”), revealing contradiction and cost before a tempered acceptance. The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible that reframes his stance without erasing his flaw. Embodied details (low-tide climb, wire-hung cog) root interiority in action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—restore harmony before the arts vanish—and her actions align (gather exiles, teach silence, face the council, then leave). Interiority is spare and more fable‑like than psychological; contradictory impulses are muted, which keeps her a touch emblematic. Still, micro‑choices (whisper instead of speech, rests before notes, refusal to argue with the council) reveal values under pressure. The renunciatory ending (walking away) carries a modest but felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Moira’s motive (communal beauty over solitary power) is concrete and governs every choice, especially refusing to eat the fruit herself. Interiority is sensorially particular to her palate/skill, and actions (tuning fork, pruning “betrayal”) reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction—temptation of omniscience versus sharing—exists but remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in a sharper on‑page struggle. Still, the final renunciation and departure register as earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motives are clear (restore the drones/solve the riddle), and the POV’s sensory‑driven interiority feels character‑specific. Bram’s involuntary truth adds live pressure and distinct status dynamics without overexplaining. Internal conflict is light—solving arrives smoothly—so the final choice lacks a layered tug‑of‑war. Still, actions align with values and the earned ritual moment reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (placing the orris, moving the swan, speaking “sanctify”) reveal a specific ethic of attention. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush”), with competence displayed without smugness. However, there’s little simultaneous contradiction or real cost; she rarely wavers, so pressure on her values remains gentle. The earned shift is credible but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aios’s desires (from guarding to wondering) are specific and dramatized through micro‑choices: sensing the ampoule’s intention, choosing a careful leak, and weaving the chorus. His internal contradiction—certitude versus welcoming ambiguity—surfaces under pressure when he risks using the same tool that erased others. Embodied perception (“thoughts pulsed…,” “brushing the ampoule’s shallow mind”) substitutes credibly for human affect. The final stance (tending nuance over policing perfection) feels earned with a felt cost in acknowledging prior erasures.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marlen’s motive—to undo regret via a loop—drives concrete choices (rolling, chalking, proving, and finally stopping), and the narrator’s counter‑motive (to retexture the loss rather than reverse it) shapes the decisive beat. Interiority is vivid and embodied (dice as “nervous beetles,” “tears were equations”) rather than labeled. The cost—relinquishing the chase for reversal—is legible on the page. Minor note: the narrator’s internal conflict surfaces briefly (“could not abandon him” vs fear of rupture) and could tighten once more before the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ravi’s motives—insomnia, grief over forgotten kindness, and “methodical hope”—cohere and drive specific choices (taking up the brush, painting the air, stopping when it dims). His fear of “lacking the words it remembered” provides a credible hesitation before the turn. Embodied details (coughing in smog, warmth blooming behind his sternum) ground interiority. The internal contradiction is gentle rather than deeply riven, but it’s sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iclea’s motive (rescue dying arts) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: unveiling the lens despite warnings, mobilizing apprentices, and resolving to hide the lens afterward. Embodied fear (“hands trembling like reeds”) gives her resolve texture. Internal contradiction is modest but present (risking vision vs. fear of ruin/resource scarcity). Secondary pressure via Meris’s protest tests her stance without derailing it.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and character‑particular—Sable’s hunger “to step beyond fate’s design” meets her craft‑driven caution. Her micro‑choices under pressure (mapping notes, refusing the stone’s unconditional promise, choosing a negotiated resonance) reveal values and cost. The internal contradiction—seduction of omnipotence vs engineered restraint—registers without moralizing. Slight limitation: emotion is mostly atmospheric, with few tactile, embodied beats under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s drive is clear and consistent (bait fear, exchange for its name), and the narrator’s skeptic-turned-accomplice stance provides credible micro‑choices (reading notes, stepping through glass). Embodied emotion appears in tactile beats (heartbeat ticking the clasp, “drowning in invisible ink”). The relationship tension is light but functional; the narrator’s own personal cost is subtler than Eli’s. The arc earns change: Eli loses the clasp/breastplate to win the name and capture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent—turning obstacles into instruments—driving micro-choices from tapping chains to re-scoring wind. Interiority is primarily expressed through sensory-musical perception rather than explicit thought, which fits but limits contradiction. The chain-as-memory vs. voyage urge provides a credible internal tension with a chosen cost. Slight invulnerability sheen remains; she rarely falters or doubts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Corin’s motive—grief sharpened into inquiry—is vivid and consistent, and it drives concrete micro‑choices (leaving the sextant, approaching unarmed, answering in pattern). Contradictory impulses (mourning vs. caution; longing vs. risk) are embodied without therapy‑speak. The acceptance of cost at the end (“even if every hinge… crack open”) reads earned. Minor note: the internal struggle remains mostly poised rather than ruptured, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s drive (“rescue truth from a pit of lies”) coheres with her methodical, analogy‑driven tactics and micro‑choices (the hinge search; the bargaining parable). The caretaker’s grief‑logic turn is credible and adds relational pressure. Interiority is selective and embodied through objects and scents rather than labels. Slight limitation: Mira’s contradictions are muted; her risk tolerance reads clean rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Callum’s motive (to archive abandoned dreams) is clear, embodied, and drives concrete choices (placing notes, prying the lockbox). The “stoically sensitive” contradiction flavors perception and action without lapsing into label-speak. Internal conflict is present but mild; he rarely meets true resistance beyond time and elements. The final felt shift (lighter, exchange of burden) reads earned though the cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maris’s motive—to verify provenance against forged histories—is clear and consistently drives her tactics. Her restraint before stamping (“She resisted stamping it at once; first she would verify its lineage”) shows value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority is rendered through tactile intelligence (counting ink depth by touch), not abstractions. Slightly limited contradiction; she stays steady rather than fracturing in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyra’s motive is precise and embodied—she wants to turn grief into cranes to restore shadows—and every major action aligns with that drive. Contradictory impulses (torment vs. completion) are dramatized in on‑page choices: paying with her brother’s laughter, touching the searing spindle, and releasing the volatile lantern despite warning. Her interiority is specific and somatically rendered without therapy‑speak. The final stance—accept torment’s radiance rather than banish it—reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and intensifies: from survival to guiding, to the sacrificial return of the geode. Interiority is specific and embodied—his hesitation at surrendering the last trace of his bride is a credible, painful conflict. Micro‑choices accrue (accepting Sanaa’s terms, boarding the skiff, stepping onto the brittle ground) and culminate in a costly renunciation. The final stance—“nothing felt lighter, yet everything felt less heavy”—reads as earned stasis rather than tidy relief.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nero’s fascination vs caution is dramatized (flight‑forum warnings vs slotting the chip) and his agency drives each turn (towing the telescope, speaking the names, sending the drone). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular: airports, runways, and silence refract “belonging” through his lived lens. The relationship with the pilgrim applies gentle but focused pressure that sharpens his choices without crowding the piece. The final stance—tuning to a “frequency of belonging”—feels earned with a modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and active from the first paragraph, and his guilt drives concrete choices (returning, sifting, entering the cave, speaking the name, renouncing the trade). Interiority is particular—“sieved hush,” “tempered regret,” and the watch hand as barometer of blame—rather than generic self‑reproach. The contradiction between professional fabricator and truth‑seeker intensifies credibly to the renunciation. The visible cost (abandoning his lucrative craft and confronting the twin’s death) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s hinge-ethos is embodied in concrete choices: ordering Ilren untethered, gifting the drawer pull, and fashioning the pendant at the end. Interiority is textured and specific (“space between apology and forgiveness”), with embodied perception tied to her vocation. Relationship pressure is clean: Rouk’s habit versus neutrality, Selka’s tenderness, and Mara’s insistence. The arc lands as credible endurance/renunciation with a felt cost of responsibility she chooses to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gideon’s contradictory impulses (self‑loathing vs. the stubborn “merrily melancholic” whistle) act simultaneously in scene and drive choices. His decision to navigate by utility poles rather than stars reveals character under pressure and aligns with his distrust of former instruments. The near‑letting‑go after the lightning strike and his renewed paddling show earned struggle, not tidy epiphany. The closing exchange with Marina cements an Earned Stasis that forecloses avoidance at a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and textured: a “clean slate seeker” wrestling with residual guilt and the need to kindle empathy. Contradictory impulses coexist—self‑disgust, irony, and yearning—especially at the lake where profit/crime, surrender, and service are weighed. Micro‑choices (using the ball to pry, drinking the water, choosing the third path) align with interior stakes. The only softness is how swiftly the empathy “download” takes, slightly easing the cost curve.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motive (reforge a bond) is urgent and consistent, and her reluctance to metamorph undercuts her competence in a live contradiction. Micro-choices—kneeling to speak beast-breath, pressing the fortune into bark, and crucially choosing to split the magic—reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. Embodied emotion is specific (talons, feathers, spice-thick air) rather than labeled. A small softness: her paradoxical calm insulates stress a touch, but the price of altered form keeps the stakes honest.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive is crystalline and character-specific, and her surrender of memories reads as a credible, costly choice shaped by her history (the cracked saucer, the birthday tracings). Interiority is vivid and embodied without therapy-speak. A slight softness: she accepts the sacrifice with minimal on-page hesitation, limiting contradictory impulses at the peak. Still, reactions to objects and the father’s return reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Griffin’s pacifism, grief, and buoyancy manifest in concrete micro‑choices (reciting names, inviting soldiers, refusing to hoard liberation). His final self‑forgiveness is earned by prior Action and object work, with a legible emotional cost. Minor softness comes from how smoothly success follows the chime; struggle feels intense but seldom resists him on the page. Still, interiority is specific and embodied, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Gideon’s motive—to grasp the “texture of transformation”—drives concrete choices (spiraling jars, palm to sand, refusing to leave, freeing the last firefly). His flaw/gift of “orchestrating coincidences” colors tactic and stance without feeling schematic. Interiority is vivid and embodied (obsidian, unfinished bread; nerves warmed), and the leave/stay beat with Ione crystallizes a real choice. Minor note: his newfound “tempered” state edges toward neatness but is largely earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Serah’s motives (unlocking the fort to free the confined) are crisp and consistent, and her calmly inventive nature drives the key tactical pivot. Interiority is selectively present—counting steps, the knuckle‑drumming, the angle “click”—but contradictory impulses are muted; risk and fear stay mostly implied. The Serah–Aldren dynamic adds texture without crowding the POV. The small on‑page cost (expending the sparks) lands, but deeper emotional friction is light.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aikan’s motive—honoring a childhood promise and deciphering eel‑logic—is clear and drives concrete, ritualized choices. The precognitive curse adds pressure and texture to his micro‑moves (dust against temples, eel lullabies), with embodied detail (tears orbiting). Internal contradiction is present but mild: fear of misalignment versus serene devotion. The final acceptance trades torment for guidance in a way that feels earned, if a touch low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s motive—speaking honestly despite censorship—drives concrete choices (the timed vigil, the dictation, stitching the envelope into his coat). “Furiously tranquil” registers as a lived contradiction under pressure, not a label. Interiority is specific and embodied (“every breath an exposed plate of silver”). The renunciation of external permission (publishing to the sky) reads as earned with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motives are clear and particular—Orrin’s stated aim and Lys’s bowstring patience govern tactics—and the relationship pressure creates the key turn when he returns the card. Interiority is mostly conveyed through embodied choices (overextending the mechanical elbow) rather than thought, which keeps it vivid but slightly distances us. The renunciation of sole authorship is a credible, earned shift with a visible cost. A touch more internal contradiction on the page for either character would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rook and Mira have legible motives (rebuild through language; freedom tested by fear), and their micro-choices—calling people, stamping cards, climbing to the roof—align with those motives. Interiority skews lyric over bodily specificity but still conveys tension (parole risk, sirens, “Fear is an obedient architect”). The friendship functions as a crucible that advances tactics and trust. Emotional contradiction is present though not deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clarion’s motive—to “surprise fate with an unplanned encore”—is clear and consistently enacted, with embodied longing (“pocketed the broken anniversary clock like a wound”) and micro‑choices that reveal him under pressure. Internal contradiction (refusing to mend time yet needing it) is present but lightly sketched rather than stress‑tested in dialogue or interpersonal crucibles. The schedule clerk’s objection is brief, so most pressure is internal and metaphysical. The endurance at the end reads earned, with a modest felt cost (he warms but the longing “not fading”).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority (“empirically whimsical and gravely serious”) drives concrete choices: sleeping at waypoints, planting the seed, testing visions, and finally choosing to sail. The luminous doubt functions as a live contradiction that complicates each proof. Micro‑choices under pressure (chewing orchid, listening “without ears,” pressing palm to ask about futures) reveal values in action. The only limitation is how little pushback the world gives her competence; the struggle stays mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Three distinct figures with clear aims and roles; Yun’s ritual competence, Mara’s attentive steadiness, and Callix’s disgraced need all register. Interiority is largely implied through action and image, not voiced conflict, which keeps them a touch archetypal. The final reconfiguration lands emotionally—memories return without wounding—but micro‑choices under pressure are mostly ritual steps, not contested decisions. Still, the pruning motifs map persuasively onto character change.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara's motivation, rooted in her specific scientific worldview, is both clear and compelling, making her actions feel inevitable rather than contrived. Her internal state, where she sees cosmic patterns in terrestrial ruin, is rendered with concrete specificity. Jonah serves as an effective foil, and his shift from procedural urgency to quiet awe is earned on the page, culminating in the small but powerful action of pocketing the insurance form.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yara's characterization is strong and consistent, with her 'steadily adaptive' nature demonstrated through her clever problem-solving and emotional regulation. Her interiority is specific, rooted in the tactile language of her craft. The only weakness is a slight over-articulation of her internal state near the end, where her purpose becomes a bit too neatly defined ("the awareness that creation and survival shared the same rhythm"), which feels less like an embodied discovery and more like a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation rooted deeply in grief and professional duty ("determined to rectify every loss"). The protagonist's internal state is beautifully embodied through sensory details, such as their emotional confusion being mirrored by the flower's heat signature. The final choice to absorb the excess vibration is a powerful, earned shift from an actor to a guardian, demonstrating a complex internal arc with a clear, felt cost ("Pain like molten snow coursed through my ribs").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. The protagonist’s motivation is perfectly rooted in his established profession and the core trait of being “inadvertently stubborn,” which is brilliantly recalled to justify the final, costly renunciation. The closing image of the "singed wick willingly drowning itself" is a masterful piece of embodied interiority that makes his sacrifice feel like a profound fulfillment rather than a tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Rhessa’s characterization is superb, realized through her decisive micro-choice to give the last basket to the grandmother—an action that feels both inevitable and costly. Her motivation is consistent and embodied in her "gently persistent purpose." The narrator’s interiority provides a perfectly calibrated generational lens, creating a subtle internal conflict between memory and hope that anchors the story's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lysander's motivation is exceptionally clear and his interiority is rendered with particular, resonant detail. The climactic emotional catharsis feels earned, stemming directly from his active engagement with the painful visions. The final choice to leave the Tear is a perfect, costly expression of his transformation, satisfying the 9+ test for an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Quillon’s motivation is seamlessly integrated with his core trait (retrocognitively trapped) and profession (maze designer), making his final choice feel both tragic and inevitable. The internal conflict between his professional hubris and the garden's unknowable nature is palpable. The final image, "at last caught," masterfully links his childhood to his final stasis, providing a resonant emotional closure that is earned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Damaris's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization leans toward archetypal competence. Her strategic brilliance is asserted ("patiently strategic shimmer") and demonstrated, but she lacks a compelling flaw or moment of hesitation; she solves every puzzle perfectly, which slightly flattens the internal conflict. The story tells us she refuses to let anguish impede her, and we never see that resolve truly tested by an internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the plot. The motivation is clear and compelling, driving every action. The climactic hesitation—"weighing legacy against wonder"—is a perfect, earned moment of internal conflict that demonstrates a complex hierarchy of values and gives the final choice its profound weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Mara’s motivation is established with precision and deepens credibly. Her internal conflict between hoarding moments for security and seeking an "impossible door" is resolved in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The final reveal of the boy as her younger self is a masterful stroke of characterization, externalizing her internal journey and justifying the final choice without a word of summary. The change is earned, and the cost is felt in the line, "Mara's own chest hollowed...and yet she felt lighter."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is rooted in a compelling blend of professional duty and a personal need for healing, made concrete through the backstory of the symposium. The "thoughtfully spirited" attribute is not just stated but demonstrated through the brilliant device of her dramatic narrations, which perfectly balances her internal gravity with an active, resilient spirit. The final change is earned, flowing directly from her contemplative nature and the crucible of her isolated work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is outstanding. The protagonist’s internal conflict between his ingrained phobia and his newfound rebellious motivation is embodied and convincing. The shift from a pawn to an agent is earned through a crucible of discovery, culminating in a choice that feels both shocking and inevitable. The line "tremor steady, certainty shaking" is a masterful summary of his transformed state.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal but executed with immense specificity and voice. Brekan’s arc from a practical soldier to an "apprentice to quiet" is a credible and compelling transformation earned within the scene. The oracle's motivation is clear, and her final, fluttering smile provides a powerful moment of emotional release, signifying the transfer of her burden. The dynamic between them is concise and potent, driving the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb. Janus-9’s motivation—envying "dreaming subroutines he could not parse"—is established efficiently and provides a compelling, personal reason for his high-stakes choice. The core trait of "composure" is shown, not told, as a defense mechanism, making his decision to risk it by amalgamating feel earned and costly. The final change is subtle and credible: he remains composed, but his perception is forever altered.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from his initial promise to the final covenant. His key actions, especially projecting his own heartbeat, are excellent character-revealing choices. However, his interiority lacks significant contradiction; he reads as consistently noble without the palpable internal conflict or flawed impulses that would elevate the characterization to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    Orlan’s motivation to outgrow his father's legacy is clear and compelling. The internal conflict is elegantly dramatized through his use of the cracked marbles—the very symbol of the legacy he despises—to achieve a more honest validation. The final change, where the marbles become "promises awaiting polish," is an earned and resonant resolution of this internal contradiction, showing a mature integration of his past rather than a simple rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, establishing Maren’s core contradiction—being both "obliging" and "more heart than protocol"—which directly fuels the central choice. Her motivation is incandescently clear, and her final promise to the leviathans demonstrates an earned change with a felt ethical cost, moving beyond mere competence to genuine wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative forward with her "soggy resolve." The characterization is strong, particularly in her actions as a musician using her instrument to commune with the space. However, her internal state is occasionally declared rather than embodied, as in the line "Mira understood the command," which slightly lessens the impact of the subsequent discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is specific, compelling, and consistent. The internal conflict between the weight of a secret and the need for resolution is embodied through her precise, ritualistic actions. The final choice to release the seed is a perfectly earned change, moving from a rigid, painful certainty to a state of "fault tolerant" acceptance. Her character is revealed entirely through action and tightly controlled interiority, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The narrator's internal conflict between their "religiously skeptical" creed and burgeoning belief is powerfully embodied in the line, "Belief felt like gravel in my mouth, unwelcome but solid." Caleb's motivation is visceral and desperate, culminating in the shocking but earned confession of swallowing the logbook. Both characters are defined by distinct, contradictory impulses that drive the narrative to its costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—the oath to witness—is not just stated but rigorously tested. The internal conflict between this oath and the impulse to intervene ("neutrality feel like treason") provides a compelling throughline. The final state of "effortless" neutrality is earned through the crucible of the obsidian refuge, representing a credible and costly character evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, embodied in his "cautious exuberance" and quiet vow. His interiority is specific and gentle, avoiding cliché. However, the characterization stops short of the highest tier because his internal conflict—the pressure of "charts or schedules"—remains an off-page abstraction, making his on-page actions a demonstration of virtue rather than a choice born from simultaneous, contradictory impulses in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ursa’s motivation is established with poetic efficiency and her defining trait, perceptiveness, is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The interiority is concrete, especially her feeling of "kinship" with Clemency, which provides an emotional anchor for the conceptual climax. The character’s arc is a subtle but profound shift from a passive collector of the past to an active agent of its—and the future’s—restoration, a change earned by the discoveries within the silo.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's transformation from a guarded agent to someone experiencing release is earned and palpable. The interiority is specific and embodied, particularly the shift from constricted breathing to an exhale that "tasted larger." Jun's motivation, while abstract ("transpose life into a new key"), is consistent with his established cryptic character, making his actions feel inevitable rather than arbitrary. The final choice is a quiet acceptance, a renunciation of a past life that lands with the weight of a definitive action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The priest's motivation is clear and consistent, and his interiority is conveyed through strong, specific sensory details. His competence is well-established, but the internal conflict remains subtle, focusing on the endless nature of his duty rather than a momentary crisis of faith or method. The demon's transformation from sarcastic entity to one with "reluctant self-awareness" is a high point, earned through the story's unique pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, rooted in the compelling concept of being "chronologically homesick." Interiority is specific and avoids cliché. However, Silas occasionally feels more like a flawless conduit for the story's lyrical concept than a person with sharp, contradictory impulses acting in-scene; his internal state is articulated with a perfection that slightly lessens its felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ira’s motivation is clear and her climactic choice between power and love is well-dramatized. The internal conflict is strong, and the change is earned with a legible cost. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language, such as "identity could be rebuilt through procedural generation," which feels more like a thematic summary than an in-the-moment thought process, slightly thinning the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.6)
    Maris’s motivation to defeat numbness is established immediately and drives every action. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional, character-specific embodiment, filtering the world through vibration and touch (“thunderous within her bones”). The central conflict between technical perfection and genuine feeling is resolved through an earned choice to "share the silence," demonstrating a profound and costly character change from passive seeker to active creator.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hilara’s motivation, rooted in professional integrity, is established early and credibly drives the entire plot. Her internal conflict between cautious solitude and the demand for active validation is palpable in her hesitation before sending the codes. The characterization is efficient and strong, with her meticulous nature reflected in both her actions and the story's prose.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lysander’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-dramatized through his hesitation with the vial. Seraphae is an effective secondary character, her confession creating a crucial moment of connection that steadies the protagonist. The final change feels earned, though the epiphany's articulation ("the knowledge that grief kept love from vanishing") verges on overly tidy therapeutic summary, slightly flattening the embodied experience of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Jalen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. The "ethically playful" trait is not just a label; it's dramatized perfectly in the climactic choice to weave futures rather than select one. The character's poetic sensibility makes his unique solution feel earned and inevitable, satisfying the 9+ quick test as his contradictory impulses (to witness vs. to preserve) are resolved through a choice with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is superb, with a motivation that is both a "hunger" and a "compass," providing clear drive. Selene's interiority is concrete and filtered through her unique perception ("mapping the space the way bats once did"). The decision to sacrifice her violin strings is a powerful, earned choice that demonstrates her values under pressure, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation (professional detachment) and Celine's (a specific, high-stakes desire for "Insight without heartbreak") are crystalline and drive the entire interaction. The narrator's interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details, such as reading emotion via static, which establishes a compelling worldview. The final beat, where some of the client's patience "lingered" in him, provides a subtle but earned shift, challenging his carefully curated detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Jonas's motivation is clear, stemming from professional pride and personal hollowness, but his transformation feels frictionless. The central change from a meticulous loner to a community pillar is asserted rather than earned through struggle; his internal conflict is summarized. Key emotional descriptors like "cautious exuberance" are applied as labels rather than demonstrated through contradictory actions or embodied feeling, limiting the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Alyss's motivation is rendered with visceral, specific interiority—the "luminescent ache" for an "organ she had misplaced" is a powerful and unique embodiment of longing. Her defining trait, being "boldly sympathetic," directly motivates the story's central action, making her final offering feel inevitable and earned. The change from peripheral seeker to "threaded" member is scaled perfectly to the story's length and is confirmed by a concrete, on-page change.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eira's motivation is crystalline and drives the plot effectively, and her identity as an illustrator provides a unique perceptual filter. However, her interiority is more declared than embodied; lines like "She had no guilt" serve as intellectual justification rather than revealing a complex, contradictory emotional state under pressure. The character is an elegant, highly competent vehicle for the concept, but lacks the internal friction that would elevate her to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb, with a motivation that is both intellectually abstract and deeply personal. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with stunning precision through the metaphor of mathematics, avoiding all clichés of grief. The final earned stasis, accepting a "continuing function" over a "sum," is a powerful and credible resolution, demonstrating a change earned with palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is established with poetic precision and held consistently. The internal conflict between a desire for visibility and a history of invisibility is beautifully embodied, not just stated. The final choice to return to the shadows, having fulfilled their purpose, is an earned and moving form of renunciation that redefines their stasis with a felt cost and a deeper sense of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, particularly in capturing the internal conflict between scientific curiosity and primal fear. The protagonist's shift from a detached observer to an active participant in metamorphosis is earned through concrete actions and embodied sensations. The line "the scholar within her scanning sensations the way a botanist names petals before smelling them" perfectly captures her contradictory impulses acting in a single, coherent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlin's motivation is specific and compelling, and his internal conflict—"wryly earnest," mocking his own hope—is sustained. His final transformation, reframing insomnia from a curse to a "covenant with remembering," is a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Adra is slightly less developed but serves her role effectively, with her actions in the climax providing necessary counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with Arden’s gentle curiosity and Mara’s panicked faith providing a compelling contrast. Their motivations are clear and drive their actions toward the climax. Mara’s final shift from despair to revelation is earned by the scene, though the speed of the insight is borderline abrupt. The final choice by Arden—to leave the pearl—is a perfect culmination of his desire to “magnify everyday magic,” representing a meaningful and costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Karima Sable is a compelling, if somewhat archetypal, figure whose motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. Her interiority is rendered through a dense, poetic voice that aligns perfectly with her role as an archivist of absences. The choice to place the valve on the podium is a strong micro-choice revealing her methodology, and her competence is balanced against the enormity of the city's loss, which provides the true struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is established, and her defining trait—an "analytically artistic vision"—is effectively dramatized. The internal conflict between her rational mind and artistic intuition is palpable when she confronts the impossible silver rail. The final choice to confess her hidden truth feels earned, leading to a credible change in perspective. However, the initial motivation ("before her resolve shattered") is slightly generic and lacks the specificity seen elsewhere in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Soraya’s internal arc from sympathetic skeptic to an integrated wielder of both skepticism and wonder is compelling and earned. The conflict is embodied well, especially in the moment her skepticism flickers but doesn't extinguish. However, a few moments of interiority read as overly-articulated diagnostic labels ("courageous calibration of self with stranger"), which slightly abstracts the emotion instead of letting it live in the concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is established with powerful economy and directly fuels the plot. The transformation from ennui to renewed purpose is earned through the crucible of the scene, culminating in the final, resonant line. Interiority is rendered with a specific, memorable voice, avoiding cliché and grounding a cosmic concept in a palpable weariness and nascent curiosity. The change is legible, the cost is felt, and the character's core contradiction—a deathless being obsessed with endings—is handled with sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling internal contradiction between her inherited cunning and her personal quest for "a fair trade." Her core motivation is tested under pressure, and her decisive actions are a direct, earned result of her history and internal state. The embodiment of her stress ("pulse scrawled proofs against her ribs") is concrete and avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    Calix's motivation is exceptionally clear and his interiority is embodied with precision. The concept of "incandescent restraint" provides a perfect frame, established early and paid off in the final smile. The transition from intellectual curiosity to absorbing the visceral cost of future trauma ("his own heartbeat sounded like distant shovels") is earned and powerful, demonstrating a change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in the core trauma of their erased identity. Interiority is rendered with specific, embodied details—"My throat remembers the metallic sting"—that avoid cliché. The final choice to leave the label and continue the mission is a perfectly earned moment of renunciation, solidifying a complex internal state rather than resolving it tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is crystalline: a professional skeptic driven by “solemn joy” to confront a mystery. Her internal conflict between rigorous inquiry and the pull of the inexplicable is beautifully embodied. The final change—from arrogance to an acceptance of fluid truth—is earned through the climactic confession about the sailor, making the shift from an external search to an internal capacity feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is powerfully established, and her defining trait—an "orderly intuitive mind"—is demonstrated, not just stated, as she moves from mapping rumors to organizing committees. The evolution of her "dual allegiance" from a source of conflict into a source of strength ("dual lungs") is a sophisticated character arc. However, her competence is so high that the internal struggle feels more summarized than dramatized; we don't see her flaws actively complicate choices in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Halina's motivation as a historian-archivist is specific and consistent, driving her meticulous, almost ritualistic actions. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly the contradiction between professional duty and "sensorial sorrow." The final choice to record commentary and carry the mountain's silence is an earned act of endurance, fulfilling the premise of a character who prefers "chemistry over shouts."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is effectively characterized through her serene actions and unique competence, making her feel both grounded and masterful. Rowan serves as an effective lens, though their internal state is secondary to their function as an observer. The characterization is strong, but Mara’s flawless execution and sage-like perfection slightly reduce the sense of genuine struggle, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is concise and highly effective for this length. Morrow's transition from a skeptical editor, armed with calipers, to a keeper of spoken knowledge is earned and compelling. His internal conflict is shown with brief, potent phrases like "ridiculous yet resolute" and "unsure whether to boast or repent." Yara is a perfect foil, her cryptic confidence providing the necessary pressure and guidance, making their partnership the story's engine.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's transformation from a cartographer of ruins to a preserver of living balance is compelling. Her initial motivation to "rebuild" is simple, but it deepens through her non-verbal apprenticeship with Marek. The final choice to stay is earned by the visceral experience of the revival, representing a powerful internal shift with a clear cost—the abandonment of her former life and maps. Marek's cryptic nature works perfectly as an archetypal guide, his function superseding deep interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her central character choice is twice articulated with the scaffolding phrase “by overriding instinct,” which tells rather than embodies the internal conflict. Her final emotional state—the “lonesome splendor”—is beautifully described but feels more like a concluding thematic summary than a granular, earned internal shift arising from the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation to redeem his father’s legacy is clear and compelling. The internal conflict between escaping into a perfect, fabricated story and engaging with a flawed reality is powerfully dramatized. The final choice is earned by the memory of his father, grounding the fantastical events in a credible, emotional hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Elias’s and Seraphine’s motivations clear, complex, and earned. The central change in Elias—from a seeker terrified of the orchard’s song to a resonant vessel who tends it—is fully realized with a palpable cost. The explanation of Seraphine’s “lovingly venomous” tone as aimed at destiny, not him, is a sophisticated character beat that elevates her beyond a simple ghostly patron. Her contradictory nature and his embodied reaction (“honored and terrified”) create a dynamic crucible for the story's single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Wren's motivation is clear and her actions align with her "poetic wharf weaver" archetype. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict or contradiction. Her "hauntingly optimistic heart" is stated rather than tested, and she proceeds with an unwavering competence that makes her feel more like a mythic vessel than a struggling individual, which limits the depth of her earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation—to understand his withered faith—is clear and deeply felt. The interiority is specific and poetic, avoiding cliché, particularly in the line describing belief as a "bonfire" that once camped in the hollow of his chest. The final change is earned through a symbolic act that directly addresses his internal conflict, making the resolution feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and internally consistent. Mirielle’s motivation to find meaning in her 'margins' provides a strong throughline, and her final shift in vocation is earned through the encounter with Palimpsest. His character, though brief, is vivid and purposeful, serving as a perfect catalyst. The contradictory impulses of observer vs. participant are resolved with a credible, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Selis's characterization is exceptional, built on the potent, dramatized conflict between her external performance of a "mere artisan" and her internal reality as a sharp intelligence operative. This duality is masterfully executed during the confrontation with Marshal Voren. The motivation is clear and compelling, and her competence under pressure feels earned by the story's internal logic, particularly the line, "Disguises of wisdom as foolishness had kept her alive through three regimes."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Eline's internal conflict—a desire for clarity clashing with a fear of it—is rendered with visceral, embodied details like "moss inside her mouth." The motivation of "fierce tenderness" is not just a label; it's a palpable, contradictory force that drives her final, costly choice. The progression from hesitant mystic to decisive actor is earned through a series of specific, pressurized internal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, evolving from a passive observer to an active creator of meaning. The internal conflict between weary cynicism and a reckless hope is beautifully embodied, particularly in the reaction to the shellfire after the epiphany. The final choice to return the coral represents a fully earned shift in purpose, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses resolving with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lina's motivation to rediscover joy is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her identity as an artist is not just a label; it's integral to the climax where she "paints with light." However, her interiority, while poetic, lacks significant internal contradiction; the journey feels more like a sequence of correct steps than a struggle against a complex, flawed self.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ada’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are perfectly aligned with her established traits. The "methodically playful spirit" is demonstrated, not just stated. The characterization is powerful as a vessel for the story's theme, but it lacks the internal, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene that would elevate it to the highest tier; she is unwavering in her conviction from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is established with remarkable efficiency and voice. The "charming rogue scholar" persona is not just a label; it's demonstrated in the protagonist's methods ("Charm buys me keycodes; scholarship lets me hide them in footnotes"). Motivation is rooted in a compelling internal drive, clarified by the costly renunciation of a former life, which makes the final commitment to escalate the rebellion feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal but potent, fitting the fabulist mode. The motivation to resolve an inner "unnamed war" is clear and powerfully dramatized through poetic interiority. The final choice to plant the postcard feels earned, a culmination of her journey from ensconced doubt to tentative faith, with the cost being the surrender of her torment-defined identity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Orielle’s motivation is clear, consistent, and deepens compellingly from a sense of duty to a profound purpose. The initial "foxglove regret" provides a potent internal conflict that is not just resolved but transformed by the story's events. The final choice to accept her expanded role is earned through her systematic, caring actions, and the cost is legible in the trace of regret that remains, now re-contextualized as the fuel for endless work ahead. This is exemplary characterization for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ada’s motivation is clear and compelling, anchored both professionally (the commission) and personally (her mother’s legacy). The trait “carefully reckless” is not just stated but expertly dramatized in her decision to hum the text and her subsequent method of binding the delegates with promises. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the line "startled yet thrilled," which captures a genuine contradictory state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, particularly the final whisper to the mountain which beautifully marries her technical and empathetic sides. The characterization is strong, but some interiority feels declarative rather than embodied, such as the line, "She reminded herself that encrypted compassion was not cowardice." This slightly abstracts her internal conflict, keeping the score just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, specific, and deeply rooted in her past trauma. Her internal conflict between self-preservation and her duty to art is palpable and drives the narrative. The final change is earned through a series of concrete actions and reflections, culminating in a choice that feels both difficult and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s motivation is consistently rooted in her past, and her interiority is expressed through vivid, character-particular poetics like "featherly determined." The interaction with Arin effectively catalyzes her internal shift. However, her internal conflict—fear of closing the cathedral vs. desire for answers—is articulated more as a summary than a set of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene, which slightly softens the pressure of her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, and her final choice to leave the feather is an earned renunciation that demonstrates her arc from seeking possession of belonging to understanding it as a transient rhythm. Lio serves as an effective, if convenient, mirror for her quest, reinforcing the theme of shared orphanhood. The character’s interiority is specific and compelling, though it occasionally veers toward poetic statement over fully embodied sensation in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail. Her actions are driven by her professional calling, making her highly competent. The characterization is very strong, but it lacks a compelling internal conflict or flaw; her journey is more of a beautiful, intricate puzzle-solving exercise than a personal struggle, which keeps the performance just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Velasco is a compelling archetype, and his motivation to "serenade monotony" is consistently dramatized. However, he functions more as a masterful, unchanging catalyst than a character experiencing internal contradiction or a costly change on the page. While his philosophy is beautifully affirmed by his final actions, the lack of a visible struggle or flaw-driven choice keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier, as the story prioritizes demonstrating his worldview over testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    Sable’s motivation is clear and potent, rooted in her identity as an artist-in-exile. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through specific actions, particularly the micro-choice to consume the moonstone, which is a perfect embodiment of her values (art/memory over safety). The final shift from feeling trapped by her anchor to embracing it as a "chosen purpose" is an earned and resonant change, showing a character who reclaims agency through her illicit art.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique profession and lineage. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through a specific perceptual filter—seeing the world as glass—which feels authentic to the character. However, she lacks significant internal conflict; her purpose is clarified by the pond and she executes her task with high competence and little self-doubt, reading more as a fable's instrument than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowan's character is compelling, with his "hard softness" convincingly dramatized through his ritual and interaction with Juniper. However, the motivation is weakened by being explicitly stated in authorial language ("His motivation tonight was simple yet vast: to translate pain into a universal language"), which reads as a diagnostic summary rather than earned interiority, momentarily flattening an otherwise nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization of Ora as a "logical dreamer" is exceptionally well-realized. His motivation is unwavering, and his internal conflict—balancing the "undertow of empathy" with the anchor of logic—is shown rather than told, driving the story's tension. Every action, from calibrating the gauge to decorating the parchment, is a perfect expression of his contradictory but coherent nature, earning the final act of release.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motivation is established early with a compelling, poetic goal. Her character is revealed through her methodical actions and her reverence for the past. The final choice—to become a guardian rather than a seller of secrets—represents an earned and significant change, paying off the story’s central thematic question with a tangible, personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, particularly for Master Ariste. The central conflict is embodied in the contrast between his "perceptively calm" face and trembling hands carrying a "borrowed heartbeat." This contradiction drives the emotional tension, and its resolution—the trembling ceasing as his heart rhythm normalizes—provides a deeply earned and satisfying closure. The narrator, while less developed, serves their role as a grounding presence and a clear lens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.4)
    Petra’s characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent internal conflict between her bruised conscience and her professional duty. Her motivation is clear and deepens with the memory of her mentor, culminating in the high-stakes, unscripted addition of the final article—a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. The secondary characters are sketched with remarkable efficiency, their entire worldview conveyed in a single gesture or phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction of the "amoral philanthropist" who is "secretly sentimental" is not just stated but dramatized through a high-stakes choice with a clear cost. Serafina's interiority is rendered with precision, and her final actions feel earned by the potent catalyst of the chick's birth and the shared vulnerability with Fyodor, which serves as a crucible for their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mirelle's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her characterization leans more toward a beautifully rendered archetype than a person with palpable internal contradictions. While her core defiance is established, her interiority is expressed through poetic observation rather than conflicting impulses in the moment. The transformation from "courtesan" to "listener" is earned by the plot, but the character herself begins in a state of perfected resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are perfectly consistent with his established traits of serenity and purpose. The character risks being an archetype—the wise, serene artist—but is rendered with enough specific detail (calligrapher, puppeteer) to feel individual. His final choice to offer the tools rather than a lesson is a powerful, earned renunciation that solidifies his character arc with a felt cost of continued solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pearl’s character as an “esoteric realist” is exceptionally well-realized, as her unique philosophy directly motivates every action, from her initial methodology to the final rite. Her interiority is conveyed through lyrical perception rather than overt conflict, fitting the story's tone perfectly. The final satisfaction with the "transiently rooted" solution provides a strong, earned closure to her character's on-page journey, making her a consistent and compelling, if somewhat archetypal, figure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elien's motivation is clear and his defining trait ("technically gentle") is brilliantly dramatized. The internal conflict surrounding his apprentice is pivotal. However, the resolution of this conflict—"The moment self-blame melted"—is slightly too swift, feeling more like a decision than a hard-won emotional process, which slightly undermines the weight of the change that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and their unique perceptual limitation is brilliantly integrated into their worldview and actions. The internal conflict between a "decaying directive" and the need for immediate action is resolved through a meaningful, embodied choice—the dance. The character’s final state of acceptance is earned through the preceding internal struggle, making the transformation credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's core contradiction—a frugal nature at odds with an expansive intellect—is established efficiently and pays off powerfully. The thrifty awe and the final, costly sacrifice of the astrolabe create a resonant and earned character arc. The internal conflict is dramatized, not just stated, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.6)
    Exceptional. The central paradox of the "scheming pacifist" is not just stated but fully dramatized in Maro's gentle, strategic methods. Tyra's internal conflict is viscerally embodied—"resentment pulsed in her voice like iron scraping stone"—and her final shift is earned through a specific, sensory trigger rather than a vague epiphany, fulfilling the 9+ test of contradictory impulses leading to a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Haleh’s characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent contradiction of being "firmly grounded even while her eyes wandered." This internal tension is not merely stated but dramatized through her actions: she uses a precise, almost magical craft to engage with the ethereal. The final choice to accept the dream as a "fellow traveler" rather than just a capture is earned through the preceding internal dissolution, making the resolution feel like a genuine evolution of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Seraphin's motivation is rooted in a compelling backstory that is revealed with excellent economy. His internal conflict and contradictory impulses—defiance vs. grief, secrecy vs. renewal—are embodied in key objects like the quartz eye and the ribbon, which are used to advance the plot. The final choice to charge stories as payment is a perfect, earned culmination of his identity as a "mender of whatever broke."

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    The curator's characterization is exceptional. His arc from bewildered seeker to knowing steward is fully earned, driven by a compelling internal conflict between scientific method and intuitive leaps. The transformation is made concrete and costly in the final beats, particularly the shift from wanting knowledge to accepting a role as a "footnote." His core motivation is consistent and powers the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is strong and revealed through action. Ora's specific skillset as an "arcane linguist" isn't just a label; it directly enables the story's inventive resolution. Her internal state is effectively shown when Marrow's compliment unsettles her, linking her perception to the story's tonal motif ("the unwritten orchestra swells"). Marrow serves as an effective paradoxical foil, with his motivation to "mend the damage he still intends to cause" adding a compelling layer of complexity to their alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is sharp and unwavering, driven by a well-integrated backstory. The internal conflict, "a rhythm caught between panic and hope," is embodied throughout, culminating in a final choice that is both surprising and inevitable. The contradiction of being a "gardener and prisoner, king and scarecrow" is a powerful crystallization of the brother's state and the story's core theme. The final act of creating a "third line" is a superb demonstration of agency rooted in the unique character trait of being a "chimeric" sibling.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maris Vale is exceptionally well-realized for this length. Her motivation to "translate confusion into clarity" is not merely stated but embodied in her "warmly methodical" actions. The characterization is strong because her professional identity as an archivist directly informs her unique problem-solving method. The one minor weakness is a slight lack of internal contradiction; she proceeds with a high degree of confidence, and the struggle is external rather than a deep internal battle, which keeps this just shy of a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Mapkeeper's motivation is established with poetic precision ("to find the quiet in the storm") and is unwavering. The character's arc is one of deepening understanding, moving from a technician's approach (mapping decibels) to a ritualist's insight (pollinating silences). This shift is earned through failure and reflection, making the final stance credible and compelling, with the cost of leaving the echo stone feeling like a necessary renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lioh’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and deeply integrated with his actions. His internal conflict regarding the "shard of hush"—fearing it yet treasuring it—provides a compelling contradiction that is resolved with a visible cost at the climax. The character’s competence is skillfully balanced with the fragility of his tools and the immensity of his task, making his final success feel earned and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between her "preemptively nostalgic longing" and her professional duty. The motivation to "sculpt identity" is tested and refined through a concrete choice. The final act of excising her own yearning is a powerful, earned renunciation with a tangible cost—"The omission stung"—that perfectly resolves her internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cyril's characterization is exceptional, defined by a core, embodied contradiction: "serious playfulness." His motivation to "defy scheduled despair" is established early and drives every micro-choice, from humming a chant to finding the rag. The internal conflict is elegantly shown as a need to filter doubt, making his focus an active struggle. His actions, particularly the climactic firework launch, are a perfect expression of his established traits and professional skills.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marella's characterization is exceptional, with her profession as a "tidal-pool chronicler" perfectly motivating her "oblique" problem-solving method. The internal conflict between her righteous anger and the need for a cooler, more strategic approach is dramatized effectively through the vision, making her final choice feel earned. The cost—suppressing a valid emotional response for a greater good—is clear and adds depth. Quillon serves his role as a catalyst effectively, though he is less developed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied phobia, and their internal world is rendered with unique, concrete details ("laboratory of hush"). The father-child conflict is established through their opposing philosophies of building, creating an "elastic tension" that pays off powerfully in the climax. The father’s change is earned through a direct, sensory experience rather than dialogue, making his final shift in perspective both credible and moving.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with Gerard's motivation established clearly as his "pocket mission." His actions and tools (gestures, vial, meter) are specific and consistent. Liora's transformation from anxious to calm is well-earned and embodied, particularly in the stilling of her "humming" notebooks. The lack of significant internal contradiction in Gerard, who functions more as a serene catalyst, is what narrowly holds this back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kestrel’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her role as a “wisely adventurous lore keeper.” Her final choice is logically sound, rooted in her interpretation of the murals. However, the internal conflict at the climax feels underdeveloped; the story presents a choice, and she resolves it with intellectual clarity rather than demonstrating a palpable struggle against temptation, which lessens the emotional weight of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her established vocation. Her interiority is rendered with specific, non-stock metaphors (e.g., keeping memories "like first editions"), and her final earned calm is a direct result of her on-page actions. The change from carrying a "promise that clawed" to feeling the peace of a "bridge respectfully burned" is a powerful, earned resolution with the felt cost of continued solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong. Cassia's core conflict between seeking "honest and low to the ground" stability and her "virtuously mischievous streak" is established early and directly motivates the plot. The backstory of the pyramid scheme provides a solid foundation for the story's central metaphor, and the line "schemes had taught exactly why people chase sparkle" is an excellent, earned insight that connects her past trauma to her climactic choice. The final shift to a purposeful teacher is a credible and resonant evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.5)
    Iria's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction. The journey from "rumored dynasty ender" to the person who preserves the dynasty for pragmatic reasons is earned and profound. Her motivation is clear, and her final choice is compelled by a complex, embodied intuition rather than a simple change of heart. The renunciation feels costly and credible, particularly through the line "ash rarely thanked its sweeper."

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The transformation from a hollowed-out warrior to a creator is earned through a clear internal conflict, dramatized when his hesitation at the void echoes his past. The final choice to "unsnap" his old identity is a powerful, embodied resolution with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the contradictory impulses established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in her own history within the system, which makes her actions feel both necessary and earned. Her internal state is beautifully rendered through specific actions, like unfurling the drop cloth ceremonially. The final beat, where she feels the "first suture tighten," provides a powerful, earned emotional closure that mirrors the connection she has forged for Jordan.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lina's motivation is established with visceral force ("felt each deletion like a skin bruise") and her key traits—quietness as a shield, resourcefulness—are demonstrated through action, not just stated. The internal contradiction is less about competing impulses and more about a hidden self awaiting expression. The final transformation is a powerful culmination of her arc, earned by the courage shown in preceding beats, with the cost being the very shield she used to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kieran’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the entire narrative. His interiority is masterfully rendered through his specialized vocabulary (“vested hush”) and sensory focus on sound and mist, avoiding cliché. The brief backstory of his mother is perfectly integrated, providing emotional depth that directly informs the story's final, resonant action without feeling expository. The characterization is exceptional because his specific, esoteric skill set is the only possible solution to the unique problem.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Briony's motivation is exceptionally clear and her core trait—orderliness—is not just stated but is the causal engine of the plot. Her internal conflict between scientific manuals and folklore is resolved through action, culminating in an earned change of purpose. The final image of her, older and teaching, is a powerful crystallization of her transformation, showing a credible change with the felt cost of her former, simpler existence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation rooted in the "uncertainly certain" paradox that directly informs the final choice. Milo's internal arc from repairing brokenness to embracing unobserved motion is earned and resonant. The interiority is specific and insightful, though a few moments, like the realization about surrender, verge on being too neatly articulated for a character mid-discovery, which is a very minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Aurora’s motivation is rooted in a potent, embodied guilt that drives every action. The internal conflict between her empirical knowledge and mystical intuition is not just stated but dramatized in her alchemical process, culminating in a change—the confession of her pride—that feels both costly and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eluan's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. The shift from amusing the spirits to guiding them marks a solid micro-choice under pressure. The final emotional state—the "luminous ache"—is well-embodied, though the initial trait "modestly fearless" reads more as a label than a tested quality within the scene's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character's motivation and voice are exceptionally strong and specific. Interiority is vividly embodied, and the final choice is earned with a clear cost. The score is slightly tempered by a single moment of over-articulation ("That is how survivors answer...") which borders on diagnostic summary rather than maintaining pure, in-the-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Irida's motivation is clear, consistent, and compelling. The final cost of her actions is made tangible and personal in the line "The weight of future errands bent her knees," which grounds her grand magical act in a believable human consequence, satisfying the character arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marlen's motivation is established early and drives every action with perfect consistency. His unique traits—being "skillfully observant" and seeing ghosts—are not just labels but functional tools used to solve the central mystery. The characterization is strong and specific, though it lacks a moment of true internal contradiction or difficult trade-off, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.6)
    Ellis’s motivation to destabilize perfection is clear, consistent, and drives the central action. The character’s interiority is expressed through potent, particular desires, such as cherishing fragility. The final transformation, becoming "simultaneously young, ancient, and unborn," is an earned, resonant apotheosis that directly fulfills his stated goal with a visible cost to the world's prior order.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.6)
    Velen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his past as a "defunct revolutionary." His interiority is specific and moving, particularly the contradiction between his poetic intuition and the demand for empirical proof. The final choice to begin anew is perfectly earned by the preceding events, and the cost is embodied in the final, resonant image of "burnished sorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Clay’s core trait—wilting near dishonesty—is not just a label; it’s the key that makes the conflict personal, motivates his unique solution, and ultimately becomes the mechanism for the story’s resolution. The choice to mend with "names of forgotten joys" is a perfect expression of his established character, a man who coaxes truth from melody. The final, earned change, where his nature becomes a literal anchor for the world, is a masterful and costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is singular and compelling, with the unique hobby of petrichor collecting providing a strong initial anchor for their worldview. The journey is driven by a clear desire "to find the place where explanations fail," which is satisfyingly fulfilled. However, the climactic realization ("collecting petrichor was only rehearsal...") feels slightly too self-aware and analytical for a moment of overwhelming discovery, bordering on the diagnostic self-awareness the rubric cautions against.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iona's character is consistent and her artistic sensibility provides a strong lens for the story's events. Her motivation is clear, evolving from a pragmatic need to navigate into a higher artistic calling. However, her acceptance of the emissary role feels instantaneous, lacking a moment of internal conflict or hesitation that would have deepened the choice and its cost. The connection between her pre-existing credo and the lighthouse's lesson is potent but borders on being too perfectly aligned, slightly reducing the sense of a genuine, difficult transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maris's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a specific promise that drives every action. Her interiority is rendered through vivid, particular sensory details ("a pulse in her sternum") rather than generic labels. The final emotional shift to "tears... of continuation" is a beautifully earned, complex resolution that feels authentic and costly, perfectly concluding her internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistently drives the plot from the zeppelin to the lagoon. Her interiority is well-rendered through phrases like "tension knotted her motive" and "heart hammering between centuries." The primary weakness is that the core internal conflict—between Command's suggestion and her personal drive—is resolved too quickly, functioning more as a premise than an active struggle in the main scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in guilt and a grand ambition for redemption. The recurring internal choice to "reject false comfort" provides a powerful, consistent character spine that structures his major decisions. The final, self-sacrificial choice feels both surprising and inevitable, earned by the preceding narrative and fulfilling his arc from isolated creator to integrated architect.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Loranth’s motivation is clear and his defining trait—archiving emotion—is meaningfully challenged by the story's climax. The final choice to release emotion rather than shelve it represents an earned change. However, the internal conflict leading to this choice reads as a smooth, intellectual puzzle-solving process rather than a deeply felt, contradictory struggle, which slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Alma's motivation is potent and established early through her connection to her grandmother, driving the entire narrative. Her defining trait, "furiously tranquil," is effectively demonstrated through her calm, deliberate actions during a supernatural blizzard and magical ritual. The story shows her choices and interiority through action, avoiding abstract summary, particularly in the climactic scene of healing the mirrors at a personal, physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the core contradiction between her creed to listen and the necessity of making noise. This internal conflict is not merely stated but dramatized in the climax, making her decision to flip the switch a costly and earned choice. Her defining trait, curiosity, is perfectly translated into the on-page action of building the anemometer, which provides the story's central causal engine.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Janus’s motivation is clear and his arc from lonely observer to active healer is compelling. His internal conflict is well-realized, particularly the choice to follow wonder over protocol. The brief childhood memory effectively anchors his desire to find strength in vulnerability, making his final choice feel earned. However, moments of interiority sometimes slip into abstraction ("some tender faculty inside him began to empathize") which is less powerful than the more embodied descriptions elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orin’s motivation, a solitude that “throbbed for purpose,” is established with potent economy and credibly drives him to accept the covenant. The transformation is earned, and the cost is embodied in the weight settling on his ribcage. The characterization is strong and consistent, with his silence and perceptiveness serving as active traits rather than passive descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Basil's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. His crucial shift from a solitary purpose to a communal one is earned through his interaction with Anika, culminating in the powerful and generous choice to invite others. The final decision to share the discovery provides a resonant character arc within a very short space, demonstrating a profound change with a felt cost (the acceptance of his own mortality).

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Edda's character is consistent and her motivation is clear, but she functions more as a serene vessel for the story's theme than a character navigating palpable internal conflict. Her wisdom feels fully formed from the start, and the boy's appearance provides a chance to demonstrate it rather than a crucible that tests or changes it. While beautifully rendered, the lack of contradictory impulses acting in-scene keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits of being "gently systematic" and possessing a "brazen calm." Her interiority is specific and compelling, particularly the idea that a death sentence freed her. However, the characterization lacks a deep internal conflict; her calm is never truly tested by doubt, and the external opposition from the priest is resolved too easily to reveal contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Iris’s internal conflict between skepticism and the pull of homecoming is beautifully rendered, culminating in an earned transformation. Athan’s shift from empiricist to participant is also credible, catalyzed by phenomena that defy his framework, particularly the moment his "aura of empirical certainty flickered" before the chiming solution. The final "luminous too" is a powerful, concise payoff for his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman is a compelling mythic archetype whose motivation is established with poetic efficiency and pursued with unwavering focus. His interiority is revealed through his unique actions—translating foam, parsing bird calls—rather than direct summary. The character's change is subtle but earned: the final image of the carriage, now heavy with the "breeze" of passengers, provides a powerful resolution to the initial state of lonely absence, showing his purpose has been fulfilled and transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orin's motivation as a "translator of relics" is well-established and consistent, providing a strong foundation for his actions. The characterization is conveyed through a powerful interior voice and specific, purposeful choices. The primary weakness is a slight lack of internal conflict; Orin questions his belief only briefly before committing fully to the perilous journey, which softens the impact of his final, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in grief and duty. The protagonist's internal conflict between confusion and exploration is dramatized effectively through her actions, culminating in an earned character change. The voice's interiority feels both specific and authentic, particularly in the moment she laughs at the tear smearing her sketch, linking her "blessed pariah" status to the purpose of comets.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation as an "apprentice of wonder" is clear and consistent, driving the narrative effectively. The internal conflict of "cautious abandon" is named and demonstrated in the key moment before the reveal, but the characterization serves the story's high concept more than it explores a deeply particularized psychology. The Curator's change is well-earned, but Kestrel reads more as a perfect vessel for the theme than a complex individual with genuine flaws that complicate the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in the dynamic between Ezra and Calypso. Their motivations are clear, contradictory, and tested under pressure. The final choice to form an alliance feels earned, with the cost of compromise legible in Ezra's pragmatic shift from pure archivist to custodian-negotiator.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist’s motivation is clear, specific, and evolves from a passive search for understanding into an active creation of meaning. The internal conflict between painful memory and burgeoning talent is beautifully externalized in the climax. The final realization that home is "a direction I could carry" is a profound and earned change, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a clear cost: the old, static concept of home is gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rhaun's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives every action, from cataloguing streets to rethreading the tapestry. The internal conflict between guilt and the need for atonement is externalized brilliantly through the puzzles. The final act of self-forgiveness is earned through a series of specific, costly confessions, satisfying the 9+ test for earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.6)
    Both Vera’s and the Marshal’s motivations are exceptionally clear and drive the narrative. Vera’s internal conflict—seeking forgiveness while refusing to sacrifice the memories that fuel her art—is the story's powerful core. The Marshal’s transformation feels earned, moving from duty to curiosity to collaboration, culminating in a shared “innocently mischievous” smile that lands with perfect resonance. The characters are archetypes elevated by specific, embodied choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Brielle’s characterization is exceptional. Her core conflict—uncertainty versus duty—is not just stated but embodied through concrete actions: holding her breath, timing movements with pistons, and using the key ring charm as a physical anchor for an emotional struggle. The climax, where she must narrate her own trauma about her childhood village, provides a powerful and earned test, fulfilling the 9+ criterion of contradictory impulses acting in-scene with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong and consistent. Elias's motivation is clear, and his internal conflict regarding time and perfection is well-embodied in his actions. The change at the end is earned through the journey and the final act of painting the mirror. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated epiphany ("Time, he realized..."), which comes close to summarizing an otherwise well-dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent. The relationship with Bram provides a strong philosophical anchor. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; Milo is a true believer from the start, which makes his journey a demonstration of faith rather than a struggle with it. The moment of "screaming tenderness" is a powerful label for Bram, but Milo's own interiority reads as too smoothly aligned with his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    Marrow's characterization is exceptional, defined by a purpose that is both mystical and deeply embodied. Her motivation to answer the call of grief is established through specific, tactile actions rather than summary. The final choice of Earned Stasis—to become a permanent steward—is a powerful culmination of her journey, with the cost of her own freedom made palpable and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilya's motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining trait ("rational") creates a compelling internal conflict against the world's forced empathy. The confession about his sister is a powerful, earned moment that validates his quest with deep personal history. Mara's appearance provides effective secondary pressure, and Ilya's final shift from a solitary solution to a communal one represents a meaningful and credible character change with a clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    Oswald's characterization is exceptional. His motivation—a "softly persistent curiosity"—is established early and credibly drives the entire narrative. His interiority is specific and poetic, avoiding clichés, and his final choice to accept the burden of the memory is a perfectly earned moment of Earned Stasis, solidifying his identity with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in the lingering promise. The story masterfully dramatizes his core trait of being "empirically intuitive" by showing him trust evidence (the chip) and then instinct (the ants). The internal conflict at the climax—fear of erasure versus the pull of his promise—is sharp, making his final choice feel both costly and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sereya's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is clear and her internal conflict is beautifully externalized in the setting. The transition from a queen driven by sovereignty to a pilgrim driven by conscience is earned through the crucible of the grotto, with the cost of her abdication feeling both immense and inevitable. Riall's loyalty shifting from the crown to the woman is a subtle, powerful grace note that lands perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Cressida’s motivation for a "palette of resolve" providing a clear and compelling drive. Her internal shift, prompted by Roan's instruction, is both sudden and credible, feeling like a crystallization rather than a reversal. The final choice to renounce her initial goal is earned and carries the felt cost of surrendering mastery, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between professional duty and "feral nostalgia." The motivation to act on jealousy is both surprising and perfectly earned, culminating in a choice that redefines the character's purpose. The final state of being "adequately footnoted" is a brilliant, specific resolution that lands with the weight of lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Amira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular detail. The contradiction between her quiet grief and "stubborn wonder" is dramatized effectively through her actions, particularly the choice to sacrifice one clock for another purpose. Her final earned change feels authentic, rooted in the tangible act of repair and the shared moment with Laleh, making the cost of her loss legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Seren’s motivation to “transform scars into stories” is not just stated but embodied in every action, culminating in the choice to use her own blood. The internal conflict between her scholarly discipline and her childhood fear is palpable, and the final shift to bearing her scars as “lanterns” is a sophisticated, earned resolution that demonstrates a credible change with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marisol’s motivation is expertly layered, combining professional duty with a compelling need for personal atonement revealed mid-story (“I had printed the first rumor”). Her internal conflict is dramatized through her choices, particularly the final act of leaving the perfume bottle, which provides a tangible cost and completes her arc. The contradictory impulses—cynical gossip monger and sincere conduit for absolution—act simultaneously and earn the story's final, resonant lines.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent for an archetypal role ("last custodian of memory"), driving all on-page action. The final change—letting go of the need to know—is earned within the story's conceptual framework. Interiority remains highly abstract, a stylistic choice that fits the tone but forgoes the visceral, contradictory impulses required for the highest tier of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Trond's motivation is exceptionally clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The obsession "to understand what clocks really measure" is perfectly translated into action, from the initial investigation to the climactic use of the key. The final shift in understanding is earned, and his reaction—a mix of "gratitude and grief"—provides a moment of embodied, contradictory emotion that elevates the resolution beyond a simple intellectual discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. Mara’s internal conflict between safety and surrender is established efficiently through her backstory and dramatized in her confrontation with the duplicate. The shift from a guarded specialist to an explorer of possibilities is earned, culminating in the embodied emotional change described as a "quiet wildfire converting fear into curious heat," a powerful and specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Celeste’s contradictory impulses—the statistician seeking patterns in chaos, the daughter processing grief—are dramatized through her unorthodox methods and memories. Her final action is a perfectly earned renunciation of her old worldview, with the cost being the acceptance of uncertainty, a state antithetical to her profession. The voice is specific and consistent, revealing character through every observation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is profound and deeply integrated. The narrator's motivation is established through a powerful voice and philosophy, with his internal conflict—tending estrangement while engineering connection—dramatized perfectly. The final confrontation with his childhood self provides an earned, costly change, transforming his practiced detachment into active healing. The line "the cultivated estrangement I tended like a sick rose until its thorns looked like comfort" is an exceptional piece of concrete interiority, perfectly justifying the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in the protagonist’s internal conflict between rational practice ("spreadsheets of evidence") and observed miracle. The arc from detached archivist to active custodian is earned and compelling. The final choice to intervene is a powerful resolution to this conflict, with the cost of a new, permanent responsibility made tangible. The widow is also sketched with remarkable efficiency and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is superb. The narrator's motivation is clear and compelling ("sought its cure the way some seek gold"), and their "desperately jocular" nature is perfectly dramatized in the opening interaction. Milo is a masterful creation, with his philosophy of "courteous anarchy" embodied in every action. The change in the narrator is earned through vulnerability and participation, not a passive epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, driven by a deeply integrated internal motivation that directly unlocks the story's climax. Oriole’s desire to chart the stillpoint for others is believably fused with her own "maps half drawn," making the final act of turning inward feel earned. The fusion of the forest's languages with her "secret yearning" is a powerful, embodied moment of change that avoids abstract epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and compelling, earning the final renunciation. Interiority is sophisticated, showing contradictory impulses between the desire to fix and the fear of failure. The characterization is slightly weakened by the use of diagnostic self-awareness, such as the label "confidently uncertain," which reads more like a thematic thesis statement than a natural internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is crystal clear and drives every action. Her defining trait as an “interpreter of forgotten languages” is demonstrated, not just stated, through her unique ritual. The internal conflict of “joyful sorrow” is a bit abstract initially but finds a powerful, concrete payoff in the final image of the crystallized light, earning the concept. Her micro-choices—kneeling, dipping her fingers, capturing hushes—all build logically toward her goal, making the final change feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ash's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans toward evocative labels like "volcanic tenderness" rather than dramatized internal conflict. The transformation from "outlaw curiosity" to redemptive tenderness is significant, yet the on-page struggle feels secondary to the puzzle-solving. Her competence is well-established, but the lack of a significant blind spot or mistake makes her journey feel somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ira's characterization is exceptional, driven by a well-realized internal conflict between her desire for the project's promise and her "quietly rebellious" nature. Her motivation is rooted in specific, embodied grief and a consistent personality, making her climactic act of rebellion feel both surprising and inevitable. The final choice to surrender a private memory for a collective hope is earned through prior causality, and carries a palpable, though transcendent, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is sharp and efficient. Marlin's unique trait of identifying walks is established and used immediately, grounding his perceptive nature in a concrete skill. The relationship between Marlin and Liora is conveyed through their shared "challenge," a brilliant piece of narrative shorthand that establishes history, trust, and playful competence without backstory. Their motivations are clear, consistent, and drive the plot forward seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied emotion ("My pocket held such a memory, trembling like heat in a clenched fist"), and their motivation for seeking the guardian is rooted in a specific, painful past. The final change is earned and shown through the small, decisive action of opening the boathouse door, providing a perfect external mirror to the internal shift. The guardian serves as an effective, mysterious catalyst without needing deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and drives every action. The interiority is specific and evocative, particularly the desire to "plant forests of second thoughts." The final choice—to teach rather than seek applause—is perfectly aligned with his established character, providing a quiet but powerful renunciation that lands with the cost of continued, humble work. The characterization is flawless for the story's thematic aims.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eren’s motivation is powerfully established through a specific internal state—the “lonely throb in his chest”—and his actions follow from it with perfect credibility. The internal conflict between duty and a deeper calling is shown, not told, culminating in the surrender that changes him from a person defined by his job to a “tidal animal.” The final transformation into "water shaped to a man" is an earned epiphany, representing a flawless character arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is very strong, particularly Ithica's embodied grief and his progression from panicked caution to calm acceptance. Marrow functions effectively as an archetypal catalyst, her inscrutability creating necessary tension. The only minor weakness is that the line, "Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float," while powerful, borders on diagnostic summary rather than earned insight, slightly externalizing the thematic realization that could have remained purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's motivation is established and gains specificity, moving from a vague hope for a commission to a shared, profound goal. The poet is a compelling figure whose aesthetic drive is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The weakness lies in the narrator’s final epiphany, which relies on the slightly declarative "I understood then that..." rather than being fully embodied, a minor tell in an otherwise powerfully shown arc of change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. Lio's motivation is shown through action and heightened sensory perception rather than told, making his "innocently cunning" nature feel earned. Goran's transformation from a skeptical master to a humbled collaborator is credible and moving, with the change hinging on a dramatized shift in perception, not a sudden internal summary. The relationship arc from petitioner/master to equal partners is perfectly executed through shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Lio’s motivation and internal conflict driving the central turn. His shift from trained perfectionist to vulnerable participant is earned by the experiment's failure, and his defining trait "powerfully gentle" is demonstrated, not just stated. The one minor friction is the thesis-like quality of the line "Texture... is the shape of yearning touching resistance," which is slightly too articulate for an in-scene whisper, though the story successfully dramatizes the concept immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lenore’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied, moving from a credible paralysis of grief to a series of high-stakes, character-particular choices. The internal conflict between her static sorrow and the emergent need to act is dramatized beautifully in the moment she tattoos herself, a choice that feels both shocking and inevitable. The final transformation is earned by every prior action, with the cost of her grief not erased but reconfigured into a source of connection, fulfilling the 9+ test of an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mirelle's professional intuition is established instantly through her focus on the "tactile" measuring tape over "bleeding statistics." Jonas is rendered with minimalist perfection, his motivation and vulnerability embodied in his "cracked measuring tape" and "steadily curious hush." The final change in Jonas—seeing rain as "threads awaiting weaving"—is a potent and earned transformation, proving the encounter's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kesari’s motivation is established immediately and her internal contradiction—"condemned yet compelled"—drives the narrative. The action of sacrificing her saffron veil is a potent, concrete choice that embodies her renunciation of her old identity for a new, more profound one. The final change is earned through this on-page choice and the subsequent trial, with the cost felt in the "gentle ache" that anchors her new wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb, particularly for Eira, whose motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" is both poignant and concretely dramatized. The narrator's trust in her is earned through the elegant line about honoring "unseen editors." While the narrator's own motive is stated more than shown initially, their climactic choice to offer the coat provides a powerful, self-sacrificial action that validates their commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.7)
    Calder's characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent and embodied internal conflict. His motivation is crystallized in the powerful admission, 'I wanted admiration more than truth,' which feels completely earned. The change from charlatan to penitent is dramatized through specific, symbolic actions rather than a simple decision, making his final stance of choosing integrity over applause entirely credible. The cost of this choice is clear and felt, passing the highest bar for character arc development at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Odelia's paradoxical motivation as a "closure seeker who opened wounds" is established immediately and dramatized through her every action. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic detail—pain is a "polite guest," and scars are "paragraphs begging to be recited"—avoiding cliché. The final act of self-wounding to heal another is a perfect, earned culmination of her established traits, demonstrating a profound internal consistency and paying off her contradictory impulses with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is established with poetic clarity and her actions are consistent with her unique capabilities. The characterization is strong conceptually, though her internal state feels more like a vessel for the theme than a crucible of personal conflict. The final line, "certain she carried no unused love anymore," presents a slightly too-tidy emotional resolution, lacking the contradictory residue that would elevate an otherwise compelling transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilya’s motivation is singular and potent, established early and tested directly at the climax. The internal conflict—fear of personal hollowness versus the desire to heal his community—is sharp and embodied in the choice to surrender his "remembered stardust." This choice feels earned, and his final state of being "emptied... yet still resonant" provides a nuanced resolution that lands with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is established with poetic precision through the "private vow" that "hummed in his chest like a broken lullaby." His internal conflict—the fear that his dreamlessness disqualifies him as a caretaker—is specific and poignant. The final act of closing his eyes not to sleep but to listen is a powerful, earned reconfiguration of his core trait, demonstrating a change with a clear, felt cost: the renunciation of comfort for vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation as a philosopher is clear and consistently drives his choices, such as selecting the path of "answers ready to unravel." His arc from passive "accidental pilgrimage" to active choice ("he chose a destination") is earned and compelling. The interiority is rendered with specific, original metaphors, and the final choice to "map the unmapped" lands with the weight of a genuine internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lis's motivation is clear and poetically established. The ferry guides function well as archetypal figures. However, Lis's internal conflict, while named, lacks dramatized contradictory impulses; her journey feels more like a serene, inevitable unfolding than a struggle against a tangible desire to quit. Her fear is stated ("heart thrumming") but doesn't manifest as a micro-choice to turn back or hesitate, which slightly softens the earnedness of her final state.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ellis's motivation is established with elegant concision and tested directly by the climax. The internal conflict between duty (upholding the law of silence) and his fierce need to understand is dramatized in the final choice, not just summarized. His change is earned and subtle, moving from observer to agent. Mara serves as a perfect catalyst, her own motivation providing the story's physical quest object.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The characters' motivations are crystalline and consistent, driving the plot forward effectively. Lysar's "regally unpretentious" nature is well-demonstrated through his patient, subtle methods. However, both protagonists read as archetypally competent, lacking internal conflict or flaws that might complicate their perfect alliance and flawless plan; the line "forged an alliance stitched with mutual humility" summarizes their bond rather than dramatizing its formation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is singular and powerfully sustained, driving every action with a credible, obsessive patience. Her interiority is revealed through meticulous action—"cooled-careful fingertips"—rather than exposition. The character is defined by her unique methodology (the tapping) and her history, which creates a coherent and compelling figure whose final choice to descend feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maris's characterization as an "awkwardly confident" seeker of meaning is established early and paid off beautifully in the final beat. Her motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from a search for understanding to a commitment to action. The internal journey is compelling and her final, earned choice to act has a palpable cost, satisfying the criteria for exceptional character work at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized, not just stated. The tension between her conspiratorial past ("old rush of conspiracy") and her current "grandmotherly caution" provides a compelling internal conflict, which is resolved beautifully when the newborn's first thought—'teach me how to rebel kindly'—directly affirms her entire worldview and quest.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Anisa’s motivation and interiority are rendered with concrete, embodied detail, particularly the freeze response during the thunderclap. Her relationship with Malik is built effectively through quiet, shared action. The characterization is slightly weakened by a single instance of over-articulated self-awareness ("to anchor optimism in realism"), which verges on diagnostic label-speak rather than a purely in-world thought.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and potent, rooted in guilt over his mother. The internal conflict between the desire to impose order ("redesign his life") and the necessity of surrender is dramatized effectively through his micro-choices. The final act of letting the card drift is an earned renunciation of control, representing a significant and credible character change with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sulin’s characterization is superb, anchored by the compelling internal contradiction of "serene anger" and being "consciously wild" yet needing measurement. His motivation is clear, consistent, and intensifies organically from an intellectual quest to a moral crusade. The final choice to hunt the architects is an earned transformation, with the cost of that commitment felt in the story's final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Ila’s internal state of being “bravely conflicted” is not merely stated but embodied through trembling hands and the feeling of a “second heartbeat.” Malvek’s sudden turn is made credible by a brief, poignant backstory and the powerful image of his wet eyes reflecting the archives, a choice that deepens the story’s emotional core instead of feeling convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Amber's motivation to "weave continuity through chaos" is beautifully dramatized, not just stated, culminating in her choice to sheathe her knife—a quiet but powerful act that defines the narrative. Cullin's transformation from a man "built of muscle and regrets" to a student of "the language of roses" is earned through the compelling demonstration of Amber's strength, making his final choice a resonant and costly renunciation of his past.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen's motivation is established with compelling clarity and his defining trait, "cool-headed," is meaningfully tested at the climax. The internal conflict between the fisher's hunger for a rare catch and the emergent empathy driven by his gift is sharp and believable. The final choice to release the echo is earned, stemming directly from the external threat and his unique internal perception of Nethe's ache.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.4)
    Amelia’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between ancestral loyalty and moral imperative. Her motivation—"Curiosity, her oldest vice"—is established early and credibly carries her into the high-stakes confrontation. The final choice to intervene is earned through the scene's pressure, and her action of scratching the orrery with the pen nib is a perfect synthesis of her inheritance and her newfound purpose, demonstrating a decisive and costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lin’s motivation is viscerally clear and his core trait as a "constellation tattooist" is masterfully integrated into the climax, transforming his craft from an external art to an internal map for redemption. The final earned change, from haunted creator to clean archivist, is profound. The internal conflict is embodied in phrases like "circuits inside him twitch," showing rather than telling his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Felicity’s characterization is consistent and compelling; her motivation to find "meaning in the mess" directly drives the plot. Her actions, particularly the choice to interject with chalk rather than words, are perfectly aligned with her established traits as a "sidewalk dreamer." The slight deduction is for the moment of realization, which verges on being too articulated ("Meaning, Felicity murmured..."), slightly flattening the interiority that was otherwise shown with such nuance through her actions and perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character motivation is poetically established but leans on conceptual labels like "gentle radical" and "aberrant mercy" rather than fully dramatizing internal conflict. Aarik's actions are consistent with his stated aims, but the internal struggle lacks contradictory impulses in the moment. Rima serves her role effectively, but the dynamic feels more archetypal than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is exceptionally well-realized through the specific, embodied details of their synesthesia. The motivation to help is accepted quickly, fitting the magical-realist tone, and the final choice to "be late" represents a subtle but earned character change, paying off the transcendent experience with a tangible, real-world cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's "affectionate skeptic" persona is masterfully executed, driving her meticulous methodology and her cautious, protocol-driven response to the crisis. Her internal conflict between scientific rigor and burgeoning wonder is embodied and credible. The relationship with Theo is sketched with superb economy, establishing a necessary counterbalance that fuels the experiment's tension. Her final choice is an inevitable expression of her core traits, earned by every preceding beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ruen’s motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from personal ambition ("become the voice") to a functional, less ego-driven purpose ("be the hinge that sings"). This internal shift is earned through the climax and gives the story a satisfying character arc. The minor contradiction between his official duty and private goal provides sufficient internal conflict for this length, culminating in a decisive choice with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lenra’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her role as a dedicated, thoughtful practitioner. Her final choice to open the doors is a meaningful change from solitary decipherer to communal conduit. However, the internal conflict is understated; the key realization arrives more as a convenient memory ("Lenra remembered the core concept") than a choice forged from contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, with motivation and history embodied in every gesture. The "matched set of cauterized choices" is a particularly effective line that conveys their shared past without exposition. The internal conflict between caution and hope is dramatized through specific, high-stakes actions, and the final choice is earned with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and internally consistent, with motives that drive the entire narrative. The coachman's final change is earned, but the concluding epiphany ("service continues only while doubt endures...") verges on a tidy, diagnostic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise embodied resolution by stating the theme too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rua's motivation is clear and consistent, and his progression from observer to participant is well-earned. His interiority is conveyed through action and perception, fitting the "zen-minded" descriptor. The only minor weakness is the central epiphany arriving as sculpted words from the clay, which feels slightly less earned than a realization forged from internal contradiction, though it aligns with the story's magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Milo’s motivation is powerfully established and consistent, driving the entire narrative. His defining trait, “wistfully pragmatic,” is demonstrated effectively when he attempts a temporary fix on the prism. Nara’s transformation from passive recipient to active steward provides a strong emotional payoff, though her internal process for this change is compressed. The choice to bring her to the tower is a high-stakes decision that feels earned by the prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-earned, progressing from a personal directive to a communal responsibility. Interiority is vivid and specific, avoiding cliché. The only minor friction is the perfect articulation of her insights; lines like "shards reflect more angles than panes" feel more like polished epigrams than raw, in-the-moment realizations, slightly hedging the emotional texture of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is well-realized, creating a compelling central character. The final choice feels earned by the journey. However, the epiphany is articulated with a slight diagnostic coolness (“a mechanism for redistribution of secrets”) that slightly undercuts the emotional immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mina’s motivation to protect humanity is clear and her actions are consistent. The conflict with Calvin effectively reveals her integrity under pressure. However, Calvin feels like a one-note antagonist driven by pure opportunism, and Mina's backstory mention ("orphaned childhood nights") feels like a fleeting detail rather than a lived-in trait that informs a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The central contradiction of a "claustrophobic explorer" is not just stated but rigorously tested in scene, with her use of prime numbers as a coping mechanism being a specific and brilliant touch. Her final wistful realization about the nature of the key demonstrates a meaningful, earned change, securing the story's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Samara's characterization is strong, built on an intriguing paradox. Her methodical nature provides a solid baseline that makes her sudden leap into "emotional geometry" impactful. However, the speed of this internal transformation feels slightly unearned; the "pinprick behind her eyes" and the new sense "arranging itself" border on a summary of change rather than a fully embodied struggle. Her competence is well-balanced with her unique limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb. Marla's core contradiction, "nervously confident, like someone who had practiced courage," is not just stated but embodied in her actions, culminating in a final choice of profound sacrifice that feels entirely earned by her initial motivation. The transfer of this exact trait to Havel in the final lines creates a powerful, resonant closure, demonstrating exceptional control over character arcs, even for a secondary character in a brief story.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Avery’s characterization is exceptional, with his motivation evolving organically from "luminous disbelief" to a profound sense of purpose. The shift from passive, sharp-eyed observer to active creator is earned through his choice to play his fiddle at the climax. His identity as a "bridge-song fiddler" is not just a label but the core of his competence and the story's thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eliot's characterization is exceptional, with his "polished calm" providing a compelling contradiction to his highway robber lineage. The motivation to understand his own looping patterns through the lens of his startup's failure is clear and drives the narrative. The final change—from trying to break loops to listening to them—is earned through the on-page discovery, with the cost being the failure of his company and the humbling of his ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, layered, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict between solitary grief and the need for connection is perfectly resolved by the story's climax. The final choice to broadcast the message is an earned transformation, with the cost being a painful but necessary re-evaluation of her mentor’s legacy. The character arc is compact but complete and deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Inyara's motivation is rooted in a past failure, and her internal conflict between guilt and duty is powerfully dramatized at the climax. The choice to "unbend, not break" is an earned, character-defining moment that demonstrates a complex interiority. The change from shame-frozen posture to a posture "like a bow loosened after battle" provides a clear, embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's central conflict is embodied in the specific, contradictory feeling of "anxious elation," which persists from the inciting incident to the final beat. Motivation is clear, and the climactic choice to self-harm is earned through the established logic of his connection to the plants, making the cost feel both inevitable and deeply personal. The transformation from being 'bound' by roots to being 'steadied' by them provides a concise and potent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora's characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling and embodied internal contradiction: her "fiercely gentle stubbornness" and the "tremor that lived behind her dusky resolve." Her motivation is unwavering, and her ultimate choice—offering not just a relic but the unwritten chapters of her own life—is a powerful, earned expression of her values. The final beat, where her resolve "bloomed anew, fragile yet alive," provides a nuanced and credible conclusion to her emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    Gideon's characterization is exceptional, driven by the core contradiction of his fact-based emotional insulation versus the deep feeling he's trying to suppress. His motivation for redemption is clear and complicated by grief. The internal conflict is dramatized, not summarized, particularly when he "talked to the dust, recounting thread count," a powerful moment of his coping mechanism failing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is superb and deeply integrated. Aram's core trait, "kindly methodical," is not just stated but demonstrated in every key action, from tapping nodes to translating for the tree itself. The motivation is potent and specific, rooting a high-concept goal in the universal ache of grief. The final transformation from "haunted ambitions" to an acceptance of absence as a carried "echo" is an earned, emotionally resonant closure that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the story's concept. Silence's motivation is clear and her internal state—possessing a migrating identity herself—provides a powerful, earned empathy for her task. Her contradictory nature is not just stated but embodied in her clockwork heart and tidal pulse, making her final actions feel inevitable and resonant. The earned stasis at the end, where she accepts her own fluid nature while securing wonder for others, is a masterful character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Roan's characterization is strong, with a well-established internal conflict that mirrors his profession. The final change feels earned, but his on-the-nose confession, "I inspect shelters because I fear living," verges on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the complexity of the preceding interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's and Mara's motivations are clear, specific, and compellingly linked. The protagonist’s interiority is concrete, particularly in the opening paragraphs. However, a slight tendency toward over-articulated self-awareness ("That symmetry of loss matched the ache I sought to forgive in myself") borders on diagnostic summary, preventing the characterization from achieving flawless embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dreamer's motivation is clear and her internal state is consistently tracked, culminating in an earned change. While her characterization leans archetypal, this fits the fable-like tone. The final shift from a seeker of knowledge to a liberator of her own silences is a compelling arc, though her interiority sometimes relies on familiar phrasing like "heart trembling" rather than a more particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's motivation is clear and compelling, and her emotional state is rendered with specificity through the "mulberry ache" that evolves by the story's end. The final choice feels earned and consistent with her established goal. However, her official role as a "provenance researcher" feels like set dressing; her actual methods are entirely supernatural, creating a minor disconnect between her stated identity and her on-page actions.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lysandra’s motivation—to wager beauty against oblivion—is established immediately and provides a powerful, consistent drive. Her interiority is revealed through precise action and sensory focus, particularly the description of balancing on the "ledge where heartbeat and silence negotiated," which perfectly embodies her internal conflict without abstract summary. The final choice is an inevitable culmination of her established craft and philosophy, with the cost felt in the bargain with the void, satisfying the 9+ test for earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Simeon’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a nuanced internal conflict: the hollowness that follows forgiveness. His contradictory impulses—the desire for release versus the fear he "still clutched shards of resentment"—are well-established. The final choice to release the hairpin is earned through the preceding internal struggle and the vision in the tree, providing a credible emotional arc with a tangible cost. The characterization is strong, avoiding cliché and presenting a specific, believable spiritual journey.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb. The protagonist’s internal conflict—a desire for answers clashing with an exhausted, rigid certainty—is established with concrete, evocative details like the "hollow mirror shard" and the "heart already wearing chainmail." The final transformation is earned through the on-page process of deciphering the chimes, culminating in the powerful choice to take the "cloak of doubt," a perfect externalization of an internal shift with a clear, felt cost of renouncing a familiar armor.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is masterful and economical. Mira's motivation is rooted in a specific past, making her paradoxical teaching method feel earned and wise rather than arbitrary. Rowan serves as a perfect foil, his embodied impatience ("starving for secrets") creating the necessary tension. The moment Mira "remembered being the old man who had once taught her" is a particular highlight, adding immense depth and collapsing time in a way that reinforces her entire being.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ithar's motivation is singular and powerful, driving the narrative with unwavering focus. His interiority is well-embodied through his patient, methodical actions. However, the final choice to share the knowledge is slightly weakened by the late introduction of a "vow," which reads more as a thematic convenience to ensure a noble conclusion rather than a previously dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Felius's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistently drives his actions. The internal conflict between his perceived failure and his hope for a different kind of magic is embodied in his choices, particularly his plea to the quills. The final transformation into a mage of "brilliant dimness" is earned through his deliberate rejection of automated perfection, and the final line, "underachieved at failure," provides a resonant, if slightly neat, closure to his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Emil’s motivation is clear, deeply rooted in the specific memory of his mother’s indigo lullaby, which grounds his abstract quest. The internal conflict of “hiding behind truth” is effectively paid off in the climax, where he must overcome this flaw to achieve his goal. The final vow is an earned change, representing a compelling resolution to his core contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between Ikram’s "stellar doubt" and the magnetic pull of the prophecy is embodied and visceral, not just summarized. His final move from "swirling fear" to "navigable resolve" is earned through the ritual, making the closing beat of endurance feel both costly and authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is masterful for this scope. The reaper is a poignant and specific creation, defined by his grief rather than menace. The narrator’s motivation evolves credibly from intellectual curiosity ("searching for patterns") to an existential commission, a change earned through the confrontation with the void. The relationship is established economically and feels profound, resting on a shared burden.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orin's characterization is strong, showing a clear arc from "lukewarm" and "earnestly naive" to a wiser state earned through action. His internal conflict is embodied in the key choice to abandon calculation for trust, a pivotal micro-choice that aligns with his established traits. The final change is earned and forecloses his initial, simpler worldview with the cost of a personal offering, satisfying the 9+ test. The voice remains consistent with his contemplative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her role and a personal philosophy that water carries memory. The "precisely humane pull" compelling her down the path is perfectly mirrored in her "precisely humane in its disobedience" final act. This establishes a strong, earned through-line from impulse to action. The character’s interiority is concrete and her final choice feels inevitable and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction between the "sharpest theoretician" and the "secretly sentimental" alchemist is not just stated but dramatized, providing a robust and earned motivation for the final choice. Her decision to preserve "tenderness" over transcendence feels inevitable due to this well-established interiority. The story passes the 9+ test with a final choice that is a direct, costly consequence of her established contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Mara’s internal conflict—the tremor of anxiety versus the calm of practiced competence—is embodied rather than stated, especially in the beat where she adjusts her breathing using muscle memory. Her motivation to "preserve trust under pressure" is not just a label; it directly shapes her pivotal tactic of using the parachute buckle story to persuade Command, making her choice feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara's motivation to reclaim feeling is clear and her internal state of numbness is well-embodied. The clones act as powerful externalizations of her fragmented self—logic versus memory—and her choice to integrate rather than defeat them is a sophisticated, earned character turn. The final state is shown, not just told: "her logic still slices through pretense, but her heart hums softer."

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary. Maren’s motivation to "safeguard space for innovation" is established immediately and tested by the paradoxical nature of the seed. Her interiority is concrete and specific to her profession, viewing the world through a lens of puzzles and mechanisms. The brief reflection on past teachers provides just enough backstory to charge her final embrace of "orthogonal approaches," making her climactic realization feel earned rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, succeeding through the potent internal contradiction of "mournfully eager." Orren is not merely described; his complex emotional state is fully embodied in his bizarre, specific, and tender actions. The off-stage characters (the parents) undergo a convincing and poignant change, their sob-chuckle providing a perfect, earned resolution to Orren's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinct and consistently filtered through the lexicon of a library guardian. The motivation evolves credibly from a vague "instinct" to a specific, articulated desire "to make friends with uncertainty." The final change is earned through the central encounter, and the internal conflict between the known (shelves) and the unknown (garden) is well-dramatized, with the choice to integrate both having a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with a potent internal contradiction at its core. The trait "stoically sensitive" is masterfully dramatized, not just labeled, enabling the final, costly choice to sacrifice his hopelessness. The motivation is clear and intensifies organically through the ritual, making the final transformation feel entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her unique craft. Her interiority is revealed through embodied, resonant details like being "serenely electric," which connects her state to the artifact's charge. The character is defined by a serene competence balanced by the genuine struggle against decay and time, making her final act of creation feel earned and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Milo's core traits—patience and a tendency to see patterns in chaos—are well-established and pay off decisively. However, the introduction of his lifelong motivation "to merge parallel timelines" arrives too late and reads as a convenient explanation rather than an earned drive rooted in prior on-page struggle. This moment of telling slightly undermines an otherwise consistent and compelling character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is singular, potent, and drives every action. The character is defined by her esoteric competence and philosophical goal, which is executed with precision. The final choice to sacrifice her own foundational memory is a powerful, earned action with a specific, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. The characterization leans heavily on conceptual interiority ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection") rather than embodied emotion, which keeps it from the highest tier but is stylistically coherent with the story's high-concept nature.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation is powerfully established as a blend of professional duty and personal penance, driving the narrative forward. His actions are consistent and purposeful, particularly the creation and use of the Horizon Knot. However, the interiority feels more conceptual than embodied; while his mission is clear, the moment-to-moment internal conflict or contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized, especially during the climactic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, consistent, and active. Her defining trait, being “persistently curious more than she was fearful,” is not just stated but dramatized as she unhooks the chain and descends the stairs. The final choice to sacrifice her lantern's power and archive the photo is a perfect culmination of her professional duty and personal empathy, earning the story's emotional closure with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lira's core contradiction—a claustrophobic drawn to enclosed, forgotten spaces—is the story's engine, dramatized perfectly in her counting heartbeats to manage panic. Her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is established early and paid off with profound literalness at the climax. The final shift in her internal state, where claustrophobia is replaced by "the crowding comfort of shared purpose," is an earned and resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation to seek “wisdom fetched from failure” is established early and provides a powerful, consistent drive. Her habit of counting heartbeats is an excellent piece of embodied characterization, grounding her anxiety and discipline in a physical tic that pays off during the climax. The climactic choice to sacrifice her most painful memory is a difficult, earned micro-choice that reveals a clear hierarchy of values and feels inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ioreth’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his unique abilities are fully integrated into his actions. His interiority is conveyed through a strong, specific perceptual filter (experiencing the world as texture and sound). The final choice is well-earned, but the characterization is held just shy of a 9+ score by the absence of a potent, dramatized internal conflict; his competence is so complete that it slightly mutes the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Milo's motivation is clear and deepens from a professional mission to a personal reckoning, and his final choice to offer up his bitterness is a powerful, earned change. Juniper is vividly drawn and serves as a perfect catalyst. The protagonist's internal conflict and final emotional shift are both concrete and believable, fulfilling the 9+ criteria with a costly, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is strong, with clear, resonant motivations for both Elaine and Lio. The internal conflict between fear and purpose is well-embodied, particularly for Elaine. The bond formed through the 'dialogue of pulses' is a compelling and efficient way to establish their alliance under pressure. While the characters lean slightly towards archetypes, their specific actions and the story's rich interiority give them sufficient depth for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lorin’s core trait, “respectfully rebellious,” is brilliantly dramatized in his contradictory actions (bowing to guards while ignoring maps) rather than just being stated. His motivation is rooted in a concise and poignant backstory that gives his final choice an immense weight, making the climax feel both surprising and inevitable. The brief interaction with the girl is a masterstroke, acting as a crucible that solidifies his purpose without any extraneous summary.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marlo's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving his every action from patient repair to the final act of restoration. His interiority is conveyed effectively through his relationship with sound and silence. The score is held back from the highest tier because his primary motive is stated directly rather than purely dramatized, and he lacks the compelling internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate a very solid character into an unforgettable one.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hollis’s motivation is clear, consistent, and well-integrated with his eccentric traits. His actions, from draping the scarf to drawing the Poincare disk, directly serve his established goal. The final renunciation of his active quest is earned by the story's magical realist climax, representing a credible change in stance with a felt cost—the forfeiture of his original approach.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Callix’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his character is revealed through his key choice at the climax. The shift from capturing to stewarding is a powerful, earned micro-choice that demonstrates a hierarchy of values. His interiority is slightly more conceptual than embodied, but this aligns perfectly with the story's lyrical, fable-like tone and does not detract from the impact of his final, compassionate act.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Meister Orin is a well-realized archetype, a vessel for the story's theme whose motivation is clear and consistent. His characterization as "unassumingly bold" is effectively demonstrated through his quiet, decisive actions. However, his interiority remains more observational than conflicted, rendering him a flawless catalyst rather than a character struggling with internal contradictions. The final line's authorial summary ("doors worth opening always teach the key how to sing") slightly flattens his voice into a thematic mouthpiece.

    Mara’s motivation is compelling, established early, and directly fuels the climactic choice. The internal conflict between careful methodology and desperate curiosity is dramatized effectively, culminating in an action—touching the mushroom—that feels both surprising and inevitable. A minor point of friction is the slight externalization of her core trait ("the chronically curious part refused surrender"), which could be more deeply integrated into her direct thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly the protagonist's core contradiction of "combative tenderness." The motivation to protect Rafe credibly overrides the initial goal of freedom, making the final choice to stay—a form of Earned Stasis—feel both surprising and inevitable. The archivist's unique habits, like walking backwards, are masterfully integrated into tactical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The characters are consistent archetypes—wise elder, mystical artist—whose motivations are clear but lack internal contradiction. Orien's purpose to "preserve the color of wonder" is a strong anchor, but he and Liora operate in perfect harmony, which flattens potential tension between them. Their emotions are asserted ("reverent," "exhausted") rather than fully embodied, making them feel more like vessels for the story's theme than flawed, struggling individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Neris’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his professional philosophy: “To mend a mask is to mend a face…”. His interiority is conveyed through specific, embodied sensory details like the “metallic taste” of unrest. His actions are a direct and competent execution of his stated goals, and the final choice to redirect applause is an insightful adaptation rather than a struggle against a core flaw, which fits the story's mythic, artisan-as-priest tone. The characterization is strong, focused, and serves the narrative perfectly, though it prioritizes mastery over internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Levin's characterization is strong and consistent. His core trait of being "methodically curious, yet guarded" is demonstrated through his actions—from the false pretenses used to borrow footage to the hesitant footfalls in the archive. The motivation to honor his mentor is clear and provides a powerful emotional engine, and his final shift from a line-drawer to a listener is earned by the preceding events, representing a renunciation of a purely technical approach with a clear professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and sustained: a scientist’s quest "to understand the physics of letting go." This intellectual framework for deep grief is perfectly characterized. The internal conflict between analytic patience and overwhelming absence is embodied in the act of mapping the knotted wire, making the final earned stasis—accepting the pattern of release—deeply resonant and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The balladeer's motivation to "build a mouth for silence" is clear, consistent, and elegantly drives the narrative. His interiority is conveyed through poetic but concrete perceptions, like his "driftingly alert" eyes. While he functions more as a mythic archetype than a character with deep internal contradictions, this choice serves the story's lyrical mode effectively at this length; his unwavering commitment is the point, not a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation to “seek out the joy beneath anguish” is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for his choices. The internal conflict between duty and a deeper human curiosity is dramatized perfectly through his handling of the diary. The final earned stance of “affectionate detachment” is a sophisticated and credible character resolution, showcasing a change earned through risk and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions align perfectly with her established scientific-mystical worldview. The final choice feels earned, a logical, if extreme, culmination of her values. Her interiority is specific and consistent, avoiding generic emotional labels in favor of a unique perceptual filter, such as phenomena speaking in "temperatures of longing."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s motivation is singular and powerful—"to mirror the sky inside walls"—and her core flaw, face blindness, is expertly leveraged into a unique strength. Her interiority is consistently embodied through non-visual senses, and the choice to accept the warden's offer "before her doubt could report for duty" is a sharp, credible moment of internal conflict. The final transformation of her perception is earned through the story’s central action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.4)
    Aleksei’s characterization is superb. His motivation is established immediately and his defining trait, "diligently curious," drives every plot beat. The concept of "sociable isolation" is not just a label but an embodied experience that is beautifully resolved in the final lines, providing a strong, earned emotional closure. Mirelle is an excellent foil, her taciturn nature applying a quiet pressure that makes her final act of trust resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Selene's motivation to "learn the rhythm of repair" is established early and provides a clear, compelling engine for the narrative. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, with her internal conflict between technical skill and intuitive understanding dramatized effectively. The climactic choice—whispering an apology to a reflection of her past failures—is a powerful micro-choice that is both costly and necessary, earning her the story's resolution and demonstrating a significant, credible character change.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation to trust Serafin is well-established and drives the plot. However, the internal conflict is brief, with the hesitation to ring the bell resolved almost immediately. The character's interiority is often conveyed through summary ("loneliness was scarce," "fear pressed thorns into my optimism") rather than fully embodied experience, which keeps the character at a slight remove from the otherwise visceral crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a desire for mercy against an absolute duty. The internal conflict is embodied in her trembling fingers and the concept of "bruised awe," which perfectly captures her contradictory state. Her final choice to risk everything for a "softer ending" is a direct, earned consequence of this established characterization, paid for with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora's motivation is clear, but the transition from reluctant caretaker to committed savior via a "hidden vow" is somewhat abrupt. Her competence feels slightly unearned, particularly her sudden, intuitive ability to solve a complex, ancient puzzle. The final reflection, "Caretakers should leave only a harvest of safety, never the taste of power," while thematically resonant, reads more as an authorial thesis than a fully embodied character insight in that moment, slightly flattening her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Talitha's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-integrated with her professional expertise. Her internal conflict is palpable, and the final choices feel earned. The characterization is slightly weakened by a hyper-articulate interiority, where complex emotional states are sometimes described with a neatness that feels more analytical than visceral, as in "translate separation into connection before the final cadence faded."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, potent, and drives every action. The final choice to renounce inscription is a sophisticated character turn, earned by the brief but impactful reflection on his mentor and customers. This shift from an active creator to a wise guardian of potential feels both surprising and inevitable, fulfilling the character's core quest in a non-literal way with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kilor’s motivation deepens convincingly from a professional commission to a personal, sacrificial act, earned by the overwhelming sensory experience of Sel's guilt. Sel’s own arc from stoic veteran to a man stripped of his emotional armor is powerful and shown through subtle, embodied reactions. The final choice feels both tragic and inevitable, a testament to how well the internal conflicts are established.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysandra's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her defined trait of being "empathetically decisive." However, the internal conflict is minimal; the choice to take the clock weight is framed as a simple trade-off ("cripple a minor bell, but heal a greater voice"), and her "vigorous tender resolve" blossoms without a palpable moment of struggle, slightly flattening the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhea’s motivation is clear and her internal shift from "archeologist" to "custodian" provides a strong, earned arc. The characterization is weakened slightly by a reliance on elegant but abstract labels like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" early on, which tell more than they show. However, her core conflict—fear versus curiosity when faced with her own past being rewritten—is dramatized effectively through her choice to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Quillon’s characterization as “prism-minded” is not just a label; it’s demonstrated through his unique internal processing (“Numbers became colors, colors became directions”). His motivation is clear and his internal state—a “latent blaze of anticipation” balanced by a “cool, prismatic” mind—provides a compelling, embodied contradiction. The final choice to escape is earned by the established stakes, with the cost of leaving some knowledge behind and accepting a new burden of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lark's motivation is crystalline and his actions are consistent, driven by a specific artistic philosophy. The interiority is concrete, especially in his physical mirroring of the grove's silence. The characterization is slightly archetypal—the sensitive artist communing with nature—lacking a deeper, contradictory internal conflict, but is executed with enough specificity to be compelling for this story's length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.4)
    Tomas's motivation is established with lyrical precision and tested directly on the page. The internal conflict between ambition (the queen) and grace (the quiet mate) is externalized beautifully in the chess game. The final choice to sacrifice the queen feels earned, directly addressing the flaw that led to his exile and demonstrating a credible, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysander's motivation is clear and his final choice is earned, with the cost of confronting grief shown on the page. However, his core traits of being an "eclectic pacifist" and "theatrically sincere" feel more like elegant labels than deeply embodied contradictions that create friction. The character serves the beautiful concept flawlessly but lacks the messy, contradictory impulses of a truly top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is clear, specific, and drives every choice. The internal conflict between her ambition and her community's fear is well-dramatized in the scene with the elders. Her final renunciation of the need for a physical bloom is an earned change, foreclosing the original path with the felt cost of deferring tangible proof.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ryn's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistently driven by his oath as a Branchwarden. The character is an effective archetype of the competent, questing hero. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction or a challenging blind spot, making his journey one of execution rather than profound personal change, which holds it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is established with elegant brevity ("cultivate foresight in action, not hindsight in reports") and paid off decisively in the climax. Her professional competence is balanced by the sheer strangeness of the event, making her deductions feel earned rather than assumed. The characterization is lean but highly effective, conveyed entirely through purposeful action and perception within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harmona's motivation is exceptionally clear, and her specific perceptual abilities (synesthesia) are rendered with concrete, memorable interiority. Her actions align perfectly with her vocational goal. However, she reads more as a flawless archetype than a character with internal contradictions; her competence is absolute, and she faces no moment of genuine doubt or difficult trade-off, which limits psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kalen's motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and dramatized through action rather than summary. The internal conflict between the drive for knowledge and regret over its consequences is embodied in the climax. The final choice to change the melody is an earned, decisive act of self-reconciliation that forecloses the path of obsessive self-destruction, demonstrating a powerful and credible character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptionally strong for this length, rooting Dreya's abstract quest in embodied emotion like "borrowed emotions bruised her ribs." Her central conflict—the need for impossible precision versus the strategic power of ambiguity—is dramatized effectively through her choices. The final renunciation ("dared not finish") feels earned, but her character is so perfectly suited to the concept that she occasionally feels more like a brilliant vessel for the idea than a person with friction against it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tren's characterization is exceptional, with his 'jittery' nature and unconscious 'triplet rhythm' drumming serving as potent embodied tells for his internal state. The core conflict between duty (delivery) and calling (coaxing wonder) is dramatized effectively, not just stated. The final choice to leave the pendant is an earned renunciation, fully motivated by the preceding events and the mentor's final lesson, demonstrating a clear and costly change in his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilara's motivation is established immediately and her internal state is rendered with specificity and embodied feeling. The tension between her role as a "mediator, not a confessor" and the "intimacy of borrowed guilt" creates a compelling internal conflict. The final shift from seeking proof to shouldering responsibility is a subtle but earned change, foreclosing a path of simple discovery with the felt cost of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ira’s motivation is intensely clear, consistent, and embodied. Her character is revealed entirely through her singular, sacrificial action, a choice that feels inevitable due to the powerful backstory of the bead. The internal conflict is less about contradictory impulses and more a total alignment of will towards a single, costly purpose. The transformation into a spent vessel is earned with every shuttle pass, making the final stasis a powerful, credible conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellan’s motivation is clear and his arc is earned through a specific, costly choice (sacrificing his father's laugh). However, the final reflective beat verges on diagnostic summary with the line "he realized his meekness had been muscle all along." This slightly undermines the otherwise strong, embodied characterization by stating the theme directly instead of letting the preceding actions carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's motivation is established with poetic precision and drives every action. The shift from a personal quest for truth to accepting a broader, protective burden is earned and compelling. A minor weakness is the line "weighed obedience against curiosity," which summarizes the climactic internal conflict rather than fully embodying it in a contradictory action, but the final choice lands with undeniable, character-altering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.5)
    Ellis’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful contradiction between his reticent nature and the profound responsibility he accepts. His internal world is conveyed through potent, specific actions, like pocketing the pebble for reply. The final change, where he embraces his role in a "quiet network of guardians," is earned by the night's events and feels like a deep, quiet crystallization rather than a sudden shift, which perfectly suits the character.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mora's motivation is established effectively through her history and "hunger to shape a new dawn." Her final state—a mix of relief and condemnation—is a strong, earned contradiction. However, her interiority sometimes relies on high-concept labels like "future nostalgia" and "shadowed elation" rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses in the immediate moment of choice, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear, specific, and drives every action. Her interiority is beautifully embodied through the "borrowed organ," translating a conceptual quest into a physical sensation. The final change feels earned, a direct result of her on-page experiences with the boy and the elder, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice earned by prior causality with a felt cost (the re-orientation of her entire artistic purpose).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eron's motivation is established early and provides a powerful, character-specific engine for the plot. The internal conflict between his duty as a maintainer and his desire for knowledge is beautifully resolved by the theme that proper maintenance *is* the path to miracles. His actions are consistent and his earned change from janitor of sorrow to witness of a new heaven is compelling, fulfilling the 9+ test with a clear, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist’s motivation and internal arc from meticulous archivist to liberator are the story's strongest feature. The character’s transformation is earned through the realization at the mica window, and the final choice carries the cost of their former identity. The embodied emotional language, particularly the "warm braid around my ribs," is specific and effective, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses leading to a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lowell's transformation from a "compassionate recluse" to an active agent of empathy is well-earned and compelling. The motivation is clear and deepens appropriately. However, some moments of interiority, like his understanding of the society's purpose, read more like eloquent thematic summary than the raw, contradictory thought process of a character in a pivotal moment, slightly softening the impact of his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, with a clear internal conflict between his role as a passive archivist of loss and his yearning for active intervention. His motivations are both professionally and spiritually coherent. The final shift to a gentle revolutionary is earned through his interaction with Madam Ko and feels like a natural evolution, not an unearned epiphany. The contradiction between his quiet, gentle method and the "insurgency" of his goal is potent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.5)
    Quillan's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his meticulous nature. The internal conflict between his professional mandate for order and his personal fear of volatile memory is palpable. The final change—not erasing his guilt but archiving it—is a nuanced and earned resolution, perfectly demonstrated by the line "felt the cold weight inside his chest soften, not vanish, but take a shape he could archive."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Clara's motivation is clear and her competence is demonstrated through action rather than summary, particularly in her cautious "false starts." The internal state is conveyed through potent, contradictory physical sensations like "deadline drummed inside Clara's ribs" and the brilliant "comforting unease," avoiding all diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is superb and efficient. Zephra’s evolution from a skeptic seeking reason to a collaborator questioning forward is earned, and her interiority is rendered beautifully through the taste-based compass (the "shy vanilla" is a masterstroke). The speed of her alliance with Lior is slightly convenient for the length, but their dynamic is established with such potent, character-revealing dialogue that it works.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely focused and her internal conflict—memory as both a perfect tool and an imprisoning shackle—is the story's engine. The contradiction is dramatized effectively, culminating in a powerful and earned choice to "forget deliberately." This renunciation of her core gift provides a costly, credible resolution to her struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cressida's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively embodied by her physical reaction to dishonesty. Fen is an efficient secondary character who moves the plot forward. However, Cressida's characterization is more archetypal than deeply psychological; she serves as an effective vessel for the theme, but her internal conflict lacks significant contradictory impulses beyond her initial retreat into her studio.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Arlen's motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is exceptionally clear and consistently dramatized. His interiority is conveyed through embodied, sensory details specific to his profession and condition, such as listening "with the whole cage of his ribs." The final choice to etch instructions is a powerful, earned evolution from personal guardian to legacy-builder, showing a change compelled by the story's events. The characterization is nearly flawless, with his muteness shaping perception and action rather than just being a label.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The android's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in its dual function of caretaking and remembering. Its internal conflict—the "static"—is well embodied and provides a strong personal stake. The final choice is earned, but the concluding self-analytical summary, "Fragmented wholeness, I recorded, is enough...," feels slightly too diagnostic, stepping back from the embodied experience of the prior paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marisol's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between facilitating and solving is well-handled. Mr. Cardoza's shame-driven actions are revealed with powerful, earned emotional weight. The final choice to open the box is a credible culmination of the community pressure Marisol orchestrates, demonstrating a change earned through the scene's crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and action tightly fused. Her philosophy, "encrypt vulnerability as strength," is brilliantly dramatized through her methods, not just stated. The choice to give Dr. Vane a die is a potent final character beat that pays off her "calm defiance" and reinforces the theme of chance and judgment. The character reads as highly competent, with internal conflict (her "doubts") resolved very quickly, which is the only minor restraint on a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kerrin's motivation is established immediately and with poetic precision. Her contradictory impulses—obeying the harbor's desire for darkness versus her own need for answers—are shown through the concrete action of folding away her tinder. The final choice to free her infant self is a direct, earned consequence of her quest, and the resulting change from a "fogged but obedient" state to one of active purpose is potent and well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner is a compelling archetype whose motivation is clear and potent. The transformation from "lonely" to "alone, yet not lonely" marks an earned internal shift with a legible cost—a lifetime of quiet vigilance. While the characterization is effective for the mythic tone, it lacks the deep, contradictory interiority or embodied emotion required for the highest tier, operating more through resolve than felt internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. The narrator's motivation is clear and compelling, and their interiority is revealed through specific, resonant moments, such as being "pricked" by the idea of resonant half-truths. Selin is instantly memorable, her nature conveyed through brilliant lines like "Death, she said, merely freed her schedule." The late-stage revelation about Mrs. Polina powerfully recontextualizes her entire character from a simple landlady to a figure of tragic guilt, making the final choice feel earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s arc from “charmed skeptic” to an integrated mourner is compelling and earned. The internal conflict between her archivist impulse and a deeper yearning is well-established. However, the final articulation of her motivation—“to translate isolation into independence without amputating love”—reads as overly diagnostic, a therapy-speak summary that slightly undermines the embodied experience preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Iriel's motivation—to honor his mentor and forgive himself—is established with elegant economy and provides a powerful, personal engine for the plot. The internal conflict becomes beautifully embodied in the climactic act of giving his own blood, a micro-choice that pays a visible cost to achieve absolution. The character’s core traits of meticulousness and quiet endurance are demonstrated consistently through action, from his rehearsed steps to the precise forgery.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.5)
    Silva’s motivation is expertly handled, evolving from a professional curiosity ("to read the echoes") to a potent existential dread ("feared her throat was becoming a communal well"). This internal conflict provides a powerful engine for the plot, culminating in a choice to preserve her agency at a clear personal cost. The decision to negotiate is not just a plot point but a direct, earned consequence of her established character and fear.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional for this length. Her motivation is established through her unique profession and reinforced by her decisive actions. The interiority is concrete, especially in the dream sequence where her skill as a "quiet seamstress" is shown, not just told. The final choice to confront the monks is earned by her discovery, and the cost (risking desecration) aligns perfectly with her established value of giving truth room to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional; Hai-rin's "demure audacity" is a brilliant internal contradiction that is shown, not just told, driving his pivotal choice to propose the solution. His motivation to find "hidden patterns" is consistent and provides a powerful engine for the plot. Zhen serves as a perfect foil, the wise master whose authority validates the stakes and whose humility allows the story's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a core motivation ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") that is tested and ultimately inverted. The story earns her transformation from debunker to guardian through a crucible of choice, not a sudden epiphany. The contradiction between her professional identity and the moral necessity of her final decision ("protect what you verify") is dramatized with a clear, felt cost—a "lonely watch." This renunciation is powerful and entirely credible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong for the archetypal, mythic mode. Orrin's motivation is clear and his final emotional shift from lonely to "unlonely" is earned by the narrative arc. Elara serves her purpose as a catalyst effectively, though her interiority remains secondary. The line "spoke of hope like pickpockets comparing trophies" is a masterful touch, but the characters' internal conflicts are more stated than dramatized through contradictory in-scene choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's characterization is exceptional, defined by the potent contradiction of being "positively wistful." His motivation to be a "translator between generations" is not just stated but dramatized through his central choice with the music box. The internal conflict between his profound solitude and his desire for connection lands with quiet force in the final lines, where his heart thrums with the same "lonesome splendor" as his loft, showing a cost to his redemptive act. His final choice is earned and reconfigures his identity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is powerfully established and her final shift is earned, but her defining internal conflict—"logically emotional"—is more stated than dramatized in-scene. She considers Callix's proposal and accepts it with little visible internal friction, making her arc feel more like a smooth intellectual assent than a struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The two characters are compelling archetypes, with the mapper’s “restrained wildness” and “softly purposeful” nature consistently shown. However, the narrator’s transformation feels more intellectual than embodied; the line “My own impatience… faltered before the logic of her engineering” reports the change rather than dramatizing a deep internal struggle. The final vow is powerful, but the path to it is slightly under-dramatized, relying on assent to an idea over a visceral, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara's motivation is sharp, consistent, and drives every action. The internal conflict is clear when "Curiosity fought protocol, and curiosity won," leading to a pivotal choice. The voice is specific and professional, though moments like "I steadied myself through empirical observation" feel slightly too self-aware for a moment of crisis, leaning toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Maeve's shift from a focused craftswoman to a moral arbiter is earned through her intimate engagement with the artifact—her discovery of the names on the balance wheel provides a perfect, concrete motivation for her pivotal choice. Arden is not a mere plot device; his hope and weariness are palpable, making him a compelling foil. The final dialogue exchange reveals a profound shift in their dynamic, from client-artisan to co-conspirators in a complex act of atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a well-defined philosophy of invention. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she operates as a fixed point of curious genius, facing external challenges rather than contradictory impulses. While her actions align perfectly with her stated motives, the absence of a meaningful internal shift or a more complex flaw keeps the characterization from achieving top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra's motivation—a "forbidden curiosity pulsed behind every blinking cursor"—is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the plot. The transformation from "brightly attentive" observer to defiant actor with "hardened" eyes is earned by the escalating stakes. Her final micro-choice to embrace the consequences ("she stood calm") provides a compelling resolution to her internal conflict between professional duty and personal conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between conviction and doubt is present, if briefly stated. The characterization is largely successful, with her actions aligning with her stated purpose. The final choice to partner with Silas is earned by the narrative's pressure, but some of the internal states, like "calmly intuitive," feel more like labels than embodied traits demonstrated through contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in past trauma without being overwrought. Her internal conflict between a desire for finality and a reawakening curiosity is shown through her consistent focus on the parasol tip and her engagement with the trawling work. The final shift to postpone her departure is an earned renunciation, with the cost of continued uncertainty made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is strong, particularly the narrator's interiority, which is consistently filtered through their lens as a translator (e.g., the focus on the "cursive y"). The sentinel functions effectively as a wise mentor archetype, though he verges on being slightly too perfect. The narrator’s final acceptance is earned by the story’s potent atmosphere, but a flicker more of internal resistance or contradictory impulse before the final choice would have elevated it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lira's characterization is strong and consistent, conveyed effectively through her deliberate actions and perceptions. Her motivation is singular and clear, and her final acceptance of the burden is well-earned by the ritualistic focus established earlier. The character lacks significant internal contradiction, presenting as a perfect vessel for her task, which slightly flattens the potential for deeper conflict but serves the story's fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra's motivation to facilitate "collective healing" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her defining trait, being "perceptively calm," is well-dramatized as a functional choice, offering "space for revelations to unfold without alarm." However, she operates more as a flawless, benevolent catalyst than a protagonist with internal contradictions or vulnerabilities tested by the events; her success feels assured from the start, which slightly lessens the narrative tension and limits the depth of her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orrin’s characterization as a “reticent scholar” is masterfully executed through his meticulous, quiet actions rather than exposition. His motivation is clear and compelling, and his central choice—to demonstrate rather than argue—is a powerful expression of his nature. The concept of "weathered innocence" is embodied well, creating a protagonist whose quiet conviction feels both earned and vulnerable, particularly in the face of the tribunal.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary for this story's length and mode. The narrator's motivation to "capture the sound of growing older" is clear and poignant, providing a strong narrative drive. The prophet, while archetypal, is rendered specific and compelling through his central contradiction: being "precognitively forgetful." The narrator's final shift from a goal of mechanical capture to experiential immersion is an earned and resonant change, representing a compelling internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is strong and archetypally clear for this length. Eloi's motivation shifts from a professional task to a deeper desire ("to harness the ephemeral"), which feels slightly asserted rather than dramatized through conflict. However, his quiet competence and unique perceptions are shown consistently, making his climactic insight credible within the story's poetic logic. Rhea serves effectively as a catalyst, embodying the stakes with her "luminous ache."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara's characterization is strong and consistent, driven by a clear professional ethos that elegantly motivates the plot. Hector's and Mateo's motivations are sketched with powerful economy. The story misses the highest tier only because Mara's internal landscape remains serene and largely untested; her "decisive kindness" operates without visible internal cost or contradiction, making her more of a perfect facilitator than a conflicted protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orin's motivation is sharp and his defining trait, "quietly deliberate," directly fuels the climactic choice, resulting in a solution that is both clever and character-driven. The internal conflict—ambition versus the pain of being exploited—is dramatized and resolved with a meaningful action. While Vela's transformation into a proponent of humility feels slightly abrupt, the shared traumatic experience provides sufficient justification for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's core contradiction of being a "forgiving skeptic" is expertly dramatized, not just stated. Her internal conflict acts in-scene, compelling her to grant Kedron permission despite her doubt, and her arc culminates in a satisfying, earned shift from seeking answers to accepting "earned wonder." Kedron is slightly less developed, with his motivation articulated in a line that verges on thematic summary ("He yearned to stitch..."), but he serves as an effective, characterful catalyst for Liora's change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation to create gentle light is established early and drives every action with unwavering focus. Her interiority is rendered through poetic action and perception rather than direct statement, which fits the story's tone. The characterization is more archetypal than psychologically complex, serving as a perfect vessel for the theme, but a trace more internal contradiction during the process could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is subtle, confident, and revealed through action. Mara's "quietly proactive" nature is masterfully shown, not told, in her mapping of meltwater and harvesting of resin. Rowan's arc from panicked fugitive to a participant in healing is compressed but credible, with his emotional state embodied in his "trembling hands" that are steadied by action, not pity. The lack of diagnostic language or over-articulated emotion is a significant strength, allowing their connection to form through shared, quiet work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Declan’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict between cynicism and the need for hope is well-embodied through his interaction with the seashell fragment. The final choice is earned, but the direct verbalization of his hope ("I hope to walk against the current...") feels slightly too articulated for a moment of profound realization, bordering on thematic summary rather than pure, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orin's motivation is immense, clear, and consistent, driving every action from building the machine to telling the story. His character as a whimsical tinkerer who values memory over mechanics is well-established through action. However, he lacks a compelling internal conflict or flaw; his competence is absolute, and the resolution unfolds without a moment of genuine doubt or a difficult trade-off on his part, which keeps the characterization from reaching the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arren’s characterization is seamlessly fused with the story's central action. His defining trait, patience, is not merely stated but embodied in concrete physical details like his straight spine and slow breaths, making it an active force in the ritual. The motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is clear and consistently drives every micro-choice, culminating in the deeply personal act of sealing the map with his own cadence—a choice that powerfully reveals his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his "reflective" nature, creating a compelling, singular character. His competence and direct path to the solution, however, lack a moment of sharp internal conflict or a costly mistake, which slightly limits the depth of his portrayal. The character reads as an archetype of gentle wisdom more than a person with contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Olivine's characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear professional motivation that collides with a deeply personal, unacknowledged need. The internal conflict is dramatized beautifully in the moment of paralysis, where her competence is threatened by her own un-woven state. The micro-choice to "Remember the method" and turn the lamp on her own shadow is a powerful, earned turn that demonstrates character through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Mara's interiority is rendered with concrete, specific metaphors ("turns a splinter beneath skin") that perfectly align with her actions. The central contradiction—grieving a past she must simultaneously inhabit to survive—is dramatized with precision in the "crystallized time" sequence. The final earned stasis, choosing to leave the sculpture unfinished, is a powerful and credible resolution rooted in everything established about her practical, resilient nature.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    Marlo's motivation is lucid and his internal conflict between regret and hope is beautifully externalized in the negotiation. The final choice to fill the ghost with pilfered stories rather than his own regret is a powerful, earned change that demonstrates a genuine shift in his values. The characterization is particular and avoids cliché, with his emotions embodied in the physical journey, such as marking progress by "the tightening ache in his calves."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo's motivation is clear and drives the plot effectively, but his characterization is somewhat thin, lacking a compelling internal struggle or flaw. He functions more as a consistent archetype for the theme than a complex individual, preventing him from reaching the highest tier of character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is strong, with clear motivation and well-embodied interiority. Elias's core conflict is dramatized effectively through his interaction with the broken gears. The final change is earned, but the epiphany stemming from a single, perfectly-suited memory feels slightly too tidy, bordering on a diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the struggle's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is compelling and established immediately as a "private hunger." The character's shift from a passive "legend seeker" to an active agent of justice is earned through the discovery of the ledgers and the final, costly choice to stay. The established trait of appreciating "misdirection" pays off beautifully in the tense encounter with the company man, showing a consistent and intelligent character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait—patience—is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The interiority is specific and lyrical, avoiding cliché. The final pledge is earned, with the cost made tangible in the line "tiny roots gripping my ribs," a moment of powerful emotional embodiment that secures the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivations are exceptionally clear, interlocked, and rooted in the story's core concept. Selene's desire to map her internal world and Holt's need to understand healing create a compelling dynamic. Holt's final internal shift is earned, though the final sentence's declaration of healing is a touch more explicit than the preceding subtlety might warrant, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prince's motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the narrative effectively. His internal state of "dread and promise" is embodied well. The characterization is very strong, held back from the highest tier only by a slight tendency for his internal conflict to be described sequentially rather than felt as simultaneous, contradictory impulses within a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maia's characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal contradiction that is dramatized through concrete choices, not just summarized. The story effectively embodies her conflict in the physical scar and her professional duty. The final resolution—"I will douse what you lit, but I will not despise the spark that made me"—is a perfectly earned synthesis, achieved through a series of micro-choices that demonstrate a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurin's motivation is clear and his defining trait—skepticism—is well-established as an engine for the plot. The internal conflict between doubt and invention is articulated effectively. However, the final resolution of this conflict feels more stated than earned; the line "he allow[ed] doubt to blink off" is a summary of a change rather than a dramatized, costly decision in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elinon's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is established early through a potent philosophy ("share light without using fire") and embodied in her tools. The story earns her final, nuanced choice by first dramatizing the limits of her initial belief; the shift from seeking "pure calm" to introducing a "quantum" imperfection is a compelling and credible arc, with the cost felt in her acceptance of troubling uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Len’s motivation to render collective grief is established with specificity and drives every action. His interiority is vivid and particular, especially the "fiercely meditative tide." The relationship with Harrah provides a warm, grounding counterpoint to his solitary quest, and their poetry custom is seamlessly integrated into the story's climax, making their bond a crucible for the final artwork. A near-perfect execution of a character defined by quiet, purposeful action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal contradiction between his professional precision and his profound ethical burden. His motivation is clear and consistently embodied in his ritualistic actions. The final choice to confess the lie about Clara Alden is a perfectly scaled climax, earned by the preceding catalogue of lesser sins and paid for with palpable vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Milo's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his sensitivity to the "uncharted echoes." His character is revealed through his quiet, diligent actions rather than exposition. The final choice to place the sovereign case under Rowan's hand is a powerful, earned expression of his role as a resolver of hidden griefs, though his lack of surprise at a magical event slightly flattens his reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Estra’s character is defined by a compelling, specific internal contradiction—being "groundedly imaginative"—which is consistently dramatized through her actions. Her motivation is clear and intensifies effectively when the stakes are raised by the coup prediction. The brief interaction with the courier adds a layer of humanity, showing the limits of her power and her empathy, which enriches her character beyond a mere conceptual architect.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mila's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a "stubborn as a metronome" copyist. Her actions align perfectly with her skills, such as copying the lyric and humming the tuning A. The characterization is strong, but lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction in-scene; her path is one of competent, determined execution rather than a struggle against a competing inner desire, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is harrowingly clear and his interiority is rendered with unusual specificity, avoiding all stock phrasing. The internal conflict between his need to create a piercing art and the pain it evokes is palpable, especially in his hesitation over the porcelain dust. The final earned state of “somber marvel” is a perfect, non-triumphant resolution for this character, with the cost of his re-opened wound made explicit (“threatens to stitch old griefs anew”).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Corvin’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear internal contradiction: an abrasive, rationalist exterior protecting a deep-seated need for certainty. His motivation is established early and tested directly in the confrontation with Mara. The key moment where "doubt seep[s] in" is embodied and credible, setting up his final, earned change—a smile and acceptance that reconfigures his core philosophy with a visible cost to his former solitary intellectualism.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a compelling archetype, and her motivation is crystal clear. However, her interiority remains largely opaque; she is a catalyst whose internal conflicts or doubts are not dramatized. The story prioritizes her function over her psychology, which works for the fable-like tone but keeps the characterization from achieving the highest level of complexity. The choir members function as a collective, which is efficient but limits individual emotional arcs.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moira’s motivation is clear, specific, and compelling, driving every action from the inciting incident to the resolution. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through the sensory details of her unique ability. The characterization is consistent and her final choice to depart feels earned, fitting the "gentle rebel" archetype without being a cliché. A slight deduction for a few lines near the end ("the quiet rewiring of their minds") that feel more like a diagnostic label than embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Characterization is clear and serves the plot, but lacks deep internal conflict. The protagonist is a competent solver, and Bram is a memorable but functionally simple character-device. Bram's final admission of being "moved" feels slightly unearned, a brief sentiment tacked onto an otherwise mythic-procedural role.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire scene. Her interiority is strong, showing a blend of methodical process and intuitive belief. The final earned change in understanding is credible, though the moment of self-aware insight ("inadvertently profound") reads as slightly diagnostic, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless embodiment of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    Aios’s motivation to “welcome nuance” is established early and paid off with a climactic choice that perfectly dramatizes his internal state. The character’s interiority is specific and embodied in the unique physics of his form, such as thoughts pulsing as blue sparks. The final action is not just a choice but an earned philosophical stance, demonstrating a change with the visible cost of accepting leadership and collective trauma. The execution is nearly flawless, showing contradiction and resolution through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Marlen's contradictory nature as a "grim optimist" is not just stated but fully embodied in his actions and the central conceit. The line about broken clocks smiling because "they still know noon passes twice" is a masterclass in revealing worldview. The narrator's shift from observer to active participant feels earned, and their final empathy-driven choice provides a credible, powerful catalyst for Marlen's change.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.4)
    Ravi's character is exceptionally well-realized for this length. His motivation is clear, born from a well-integrated backstory, and his core conflict between hope and exhaustion feels authentic. The progression from sleepless anxiety to earned, peaceful exhaustion is a compelling and complete arc, driven by a choice that perfectly aligns with his established traits as both painter and caregiver.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Iclea's motivation to rescue her culture is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure, leading to a high-stakes choice. Her interiority is revealed through decisive action rather than summary, particularly in the moment she unveils the lens despite the risks. The brief appearance of Meris provides sharp, effective pressure that clarifies Iclea's values, making her subsequent generosity feel earned rather than assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Sable's motivation is established early and her actions are a direct, "neatly inventive" expression of her core traits. The internal contradiction between prestige and personal hunger feels authentic, and the final choice is a sophisticated resolution—choosing uncharted liberty over predictable power—that is earned by her cautious, engineering mindset recognizing a "trap shaped like a gift."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli's motivation to "trick fear" is clear and consistently drives the plot. The narrator's shift from "skeptic turned accomplice" provides a functional, if underdeveloped, perspective. The characters' actions are aligned with their stated goals, but their interiority, particularly the narrator's, feels more observational than deeply conflicted in the moment, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her worldview is powerfully rendered through her actions. However, her characterization lacks a compelling internal contradiction; she is portrayed as almost flawlessly competent, which slightly flattens her arc. The conflict is entirely external, and while her response is creative, her internal state remains resolute rather than tested by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The motivation, born from a blend of professional duty and personal grief ("mourning has sharpened my compass into a spike"), is both clear and deeply felt. The micro-choice to leave behind Elyth's sextant is a perfect, crucible moment, demonstrating a shift from ambition to vulnerability that proves essential. The final resolve—"even if every hinge in my own soul must crack open too"—is a powerful, earned acceptance of cost, directly tying the internal arc to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "emotionally rational," is successfully dramatized in the climax. The caretaker's turn is grounded and credible. However, the dialogue in the confrontation scene feels overly stylized and aphoristic for both characters, momentarily sacrificing authentic voice for thematic declaration, as when Mira states, "beauty divorced from honesty was only gilded rot."

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    Callum's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, established early as the "archeologist of abandoned dreams." The core internal contradiction—"stoically sensitive"—is not just stated but dramatized through his methodical actions versus his profound internal experience and final gesture of kissing the wood. The character is fully realized through his unique, purpose-driven actions, and his internal change—feeling "lighter" after the exchange of remembrance—is earned through the scene's central discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maris's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her defined traits ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive"). Her core competence is balanced with a genuine struggle against the environment. The final choice to stamp the codex under duress is a powerful crystallization of her values, earned by the preceding investigation and demonstrating a clear hierarchy of values with the visible cost of losing access to the library.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lyra’s motivation is intensely personal yet drives a communal resolution, rooted in a potent internal conflict between torment and completion. Her final choice—to transform sorrow rather than banish it—is a sophisticated and earned change, crystalized in the potent action of "folding invisible paper around her heart's bruises." The shift from being haunted by an absence to holding a voice "without bleeding" is a masterfully executed arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ashraf’s motivation is powerfully rendered, progressing from a trauma-defined phantom to an agent of bleak purpose. The internal conflict at the climax—pitting the last tangible memory of his bride against the abstract good of a continent—is dramatized with precision and cost. The final choice is earned through the story's consistent focus on his relationship with the geode, making his sacrifice a genuine and resonant character change.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nero's motivation hinges on a brief, late-arriving reflection on airports, which feels slightly thin to anchor the story's powerful epiphany. The pilgrim serves more as a beautiful, functional cipher than a character exerting pressure. While Nero's internal state is well-rendered, his core contradiction (lonely wanderer vs. seeker of belonging) is more stated than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal conflict—a professional forger of memories haunted by an unknown truth—is embodied and specific, not summarized. The final realization that his frauds were rehearsals of an original, personal omission is a devastating and earned epiphany that provides a powerful, character-driven engine for the entire story. The shift in his motivation is credible and lands with the full weight of the preceding narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.6)
    Mara’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a coherent internal philosophy that is tested and affirmed on the page. Her motivation to “recycle mistakes into wisdom” is not just stated but dramatized through her key micro-choice to “untether” the scholar early, an action that perfectly embodies her “uncommonly thoughtful style.” The final beat, where she creates the pendant, provides a powerful, earned closure to her internal arc, demonstrating a change in state by making her philosophy tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Gideon’s internal conflict embodied through concrete actions and sensory details like the "merrily melancholic whistle." His contradictory impulses—fear of steering any course versus the promise to his sister—are active throughout, compelling choices. The final shift toward faith is earned through the crucible of the storm, making his ultimate reliance on Marina a credible change with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling, with a strong internal conflict between his criminal past and his desire for a "clean slate" through empathy. The contradiction is well-embodied in moments like "jaded wonder," preventing a simplistic arc. The final choice is earned through the crucible of the lake's visions, with the pledge "to kindle empathy where none remains" feeling slightly on-the-nose but ultimately validated by the closing actions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The internal conflict between Liora’s grief-driven goal and her reluctance toward metamorphosis is dramatized with precision ("against my wishes"). Her final choice to share the transformation is a powerful, earned resolution that demonstrates a complex hierarchy of values, accepting a personal cost for reunion. Aric's single line is perfectly pitched, offering a collaborative solution rather than a simple magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is potent and particular, driving the narrative with poetic conviction. Her interiority is beautifully rendered through embodied actions, such as the card shuffles that "rasped like prayer." The final choice to surrender memories is a deeply earned sacrifice, directly rooted in her established love and the specific memory of her father guiding her hand, making the resolution feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional. Griffin's motivation is singular and powerful, and his internal conflict—the pacifist's vow against his immense grief—is embodied in his variable gravity. The final act of self-forgiveness is a potent, earned choice that feels both surprising and inevitable, demonstrating a profound internal shift with a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Gideon's motivation—to understand transformation—is established early and drives every action, from placing the jars to his final internal shift. His past as a philanthropist who funded arcane projects provides a credible, unforced backstory for his accidental prophecy-fulfillment. The final change to feeling "newly tempered" is earned through the scene's accumulated pressures and insights, representing a subtle but definitive character reconfiguration with the felt cost of his old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Serah is characterized effectively through action, particularly her "calmly inventive" nature which pays off in the climax. Her motivation for the revolution remains somewhat abstract, relying on the category of "prisoners, debtors, and dreamers" rather than a more personal or deeply felt conviction. While her competence is compelling, the characterization is more functional than layered with internal contradiction, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aikan’s motivation is clear and his interiority is potent, particularly the shift from feeling "cursed" to guided. The epiphany that the pattern is an eel migration map is a sharp turn that re-contextualizes his entire purpose from an abstract quest to a personal covenant. His emotions are well-embodied, especially in the image of tears floating like small moons. The character arc is complete and earned within the compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a potent internal conflict between censorship and expression. His defining trait of being "furiously tranquil" is not just stated but embodied in his patient, methodical vigil. The final choice to write for the sky is a perfectly earned renunciation of his former struggle, a change that forecloses the path of seeking validation from his censors, with the cost being a form of solitary, cosmic publication.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The characters serve their philosophical roles with consistency, and their shift from duelists to partners is earned. Orrin's motivation is clarified effectively at the climax. However, they operate more as elegant archetypes than as individuals with deep internal contradiction, and the final dialogue exchanges feel slightly too polished and declarative, bordering on thematic summary rather than discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rook and Mira are compelling archetypes whose motivations are clear and consistent with the story's magical-realist frame. Their shared history provides a strong, efficient foundation for their collaboration. However, their interiority remains somewhat subordinate to the story's lyrical voice; they feel more like vessels for the central theme than individuals with complex, contradictory impulses acting in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clarion’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on recurring labels like “wistful” and “steely longing.” The attribute “strategically creative” is asserted rather than demonstrated, feeling more like authorial instruction. However, the final change is nuanced and earned, as the longing is shown to be “warming, though not fading,” which provides a credible emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by the internal conflict of "luminous doubt," which is dramatized rather than merely stated. The protagonist's shift from observer to "midwife" and finally to active voyager is earned through on-page events. The final choice to build a mast and sail is a powerful culmination of this internal arc, motivated by the story's fantastic logic and carrying a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Characterization is archetypal yet effective, serving the story’s mythic tone. Motivations are clear and unified, and the final beat where each character confronts a specific memory provides a sharp, earned pang of specificity. While their internal states are largely harmonious throughout the quest, the brief, potent flashes of backstory at the climax provide sufficient depth and grounding for the resolution. The change is earned through their shared ritual and confrontation with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's motivation as a researcher drawing cosmic parallels is clear and intensifies to compel her choice to clear the trench, with embodied humility in her actions like sampling dust; Jonah provides secondary pressure through his procedural urgency, shifting status dynamics gently. Interior conflict shows in her quiet correction of Jonah, revealing contradictory impulses of science and custodianship without stock phrasing. The final renunciation of drama feels earned with a felt cost of patience over urgency, visible in Jonah's awe. Flaws are minor, like slightly archetypal traits, but they don't undermine the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Yara's motivation to decode the ledger and expose the network is clear and rooted in her adaptive traits as a glass artist, with embodied emotions like anger annealing into resolve showing contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding stock phrasing, as seen in her sketching constellations to channel worry. The final endurance forecloses naive safety with felt cost in ongoing pursuit, earning Charged Poise. Minor slip in over-articulated self-awareness mid-crisis slightly hedges emotional rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and intensifies through micro-choices like selecting specific forks, revealing a hierarchy of values with embodied emotions in pain and pulse quickening; interior conflict shows contradictory rage and grief via sensor readings, earning the final endurance with visible cost in exhaustion and molten snow pain. However, some interiority veers into abstract phrasing, like "the ache of it determined to rectify," slightly detaching from concrete embodiment.

    Quillon’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix time yet recoiling from the cost—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned by the garden’s tightening ivy and the sync of his heartbeat with the hollow clock, a visible bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Damaris is vividly individuated through restrained, embodied emotion and tactical micro-choices; her chained state, silent music-work, and gradual self-liberation keep motivation legible. The arrow-to-code translation, self-ungagging motion, and fire-gilt exit accumulate into a costly, earned stance that forecloses return to captivity. Flaws remain tacit—stoic patience as refusal and risk of hubris—without authorial lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jarom’s synesthetic trait is woven consistently through choices; the interiority drives micro-decisions under water-pressure. The forfeiture of chromatic hearing functions as earned cost tied to design ambition. Micro-choice at the forge – clutching the silver coil while color drains – crystallizes value hierarchy with visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—“shadows sharpen and people grew careless with their faces”—but the moment of renunciation (emptying the jar) feels slightly under-motivated; the boy-as-younger-self arrives late and is more symbol than pressure. Still, her embodied dread and luminous disbelief anchor the final step through the door with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her self-to-self debate about staying or leaving, dramatised while she primes the furnace, creates a clear before/after renunciation that charges the final image of her “actively alight” face.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between “phobia-ridden” and “studio’s prized” is dramatized in the trembling knees and live-mic confession. The final renunciation—choosing rebirth over scripted death—earns its cost through prior beats of identity fracture and ledger discovery. Micro-choices (climbing down to the child, scanning the cast) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Only slight over-articulation of “I was nobody and everyone” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle’s interiority is vivid—her breath-controlled handling of the booklet and spiral-tracing in dust show embodied obsession—but the “mildly obsessed” trait never collides with a contradictory impulse; her arc is steady transmission rather than struggle. Brekan’s silent salute crystallizes a credible shift from skeptic to apprentice of quiet, yet his scarred-arm detail and helm-tuck remain ornamental, not value-revealing. The relationship crucible is present but gentle; status tilts without visible cost to either party. Overall, strong individuation and micro-choice, but the internal contradiction bar for 9+ is not quite met.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Janus-9’s synthetic interiority is vivid (“envying their dreaming subroutines”), and the final touch of the icy string visibly costs: he merges with Echo and loses his sole identity, an on-page sacrifice. Motivations hold—compulsion to “properly sort” both trash and mystery—yet Echo remains off-stage, weakening relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the pulse-recording beat crystallizes his contradictory motives. The final choice to share the lens is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. Mara’s late entry is under-leveraged for status tension, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orlan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulses—despising his father’s legacy yet carrying the marbles—drive every beat. The final choice to keep the cracked marbles as “promises” is earned by the garden’s testimony and his own caretaking. Minor slip: “wisely pragmatic” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maren is a vivid, consistent subject whose kindness and mechanical warmth propel every beat; the internal contradiction—curiosity versus care for the beasts—tightens with the lever pull and powers the earned renunciation. Emotions are embodied (gloved fingers, cold metal thrumming, guilt crystallizing into apology); no therapeutic labels disrupt. The final promise to gain consent first crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost, satisfying Q1.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—obsession vs. survival—are embodied in her soggy resolve to open the trapdoor; the final choice costs her the building’s silence and her exile from performance, earned by prior causality. Interiority is specific, e.g., “water quivered like skin under sound.” No relationship crucible on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “quinine ghosts” and “silver seed” carry visceral weight. The micro-choice to release the seed is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics. Minor slip: “heavier than confession, lighter than denial” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s skeptical creed collides with embodied belief (“gravel in my mouth”). Caleb’s swallowed-logbook guilt is dramatized through tactile ritual with the valve wheel, and the final micro-choice—folding the wheel away unsold—earns a credible renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is vivid—"neutrality felt like treason"—and the oath to witness without judgment creates a clear, contradictory impulse that culminates in the final refusal to intervene. However, the cost of that refusal is more asserted than embodied; we see the rising water but not a palpable forfeiture that scars the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Arlen’s interiority balances gentle resolve with open-ended awe; every micro-choice (placing the box, whispering the pledge, letting silence answer) tightens the arc and charges the final image. Motivation remains coherent, rooted in his vocation and the specific curl he carries. Embodied emotion reads through breath, touch, and small wonder rather than label language. A lone deduction for slightly elevated self-awareness at the pledge moment keeps the score from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ursa’s hunger to “collect the stories walls have heard” is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling, coaxing light-fiber, pressing forehead to metal—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is specific (“almost afraid the fragile ash would interpret her heartbeat as a gust”) and contradictory impulses (trepidation vs hunger) act simultaneously. The final realization that she must stitch collections together is earned by the diary fragments and the silo’s answering vibration, foreclosing mere archiving with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    vivid interiority and consistent motives, but emotional truth occasionally drifts toward lyrical summary; cost legible in renunciation yet conveyed more in speech than embodied action

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The priest’s interiority is vivid—his layered chants, taste of dust, and final winding of loops into a chord all embody motive and cost. The girl remains a vessel rather than a character, but the demon’s fidgeting self-awareness supplies relational pressure. The earned renunciation (demon’s sigh and release) carries visible cost and is rooted in prior rhetorical pressure. No stock phrasing; micro-choices (offering the palette, storing the chord) reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “chronological homesickness” and tactile use of the nautilus anchor motive. The final renunciation (leaving before the hush collapses) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: the fortune-cookie vendors never appear on stage, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is moot, but this does not undercut the single-POV arc.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ira’s contradictory impulses—power-hunger vs. self-erasure—are embodied in each droplet she edits; the final renunciation of tyrant-selves is earned by the cumulative cost of erased timelines, felt in the hush after the ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is embodied and specific—her cane “thunderous within her bones,” her pulse “fluttered, uncertain but willing.” The contradiction between her deafness and vocation is dramatized through tactile listening and the final renunciation of hoarding silence. The cost is felt when she seals the needle and leaves the cavern, carrying “her newly awakened heart as baton.” Minor slip: the note’s graphite cue is clever but slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hilara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through the micro-choice to open the tube and later to transmit codes; her solitude/integrity conflict is embodied in the hesitation before the decisive act. Coren remains functional rather than individuated, but the pair’s shared devotion to data creates credible pressure. The final renunciation—accepting exile to preserve data integrity—earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s aromatic caution and grief are embodied in trembling fingers and the sealed vial; the memory flashback is anchored to present scent and alters his stance. Seraphae’s brief admission mirrors his flaw, creating relational pressure that steadies him. The final choice—to capture the vapor not to imprison but to study—earns a credible shift with visible cost (tears, coral light). Interiority stays specific, though the epiphany edges close to tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jalen’s interiority is vivid—his “ethically playful curiosity” drives every micro-choice, from coiling the rope to drumming its fibers. The contradictory pull between hope and wisdom is embodied in sweat mingling with starlight, not abstracted. The final compromise costs him a length of rope and a slice of night, a felt price scaled to the piece. Only the slight over-articulation of “texture is felt, not archived” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene’s hunger for unfinished beauty is embodied in every micro-choice—bowing to the sapling, slicing nets with violin strings—yet the interior contradiction (preserve vs. release) is more asserted than dramatized in real time. The final renunciation—leaving the bowl—carries visible cost and seals her stance, but the family-bonfire backstory is slightly over-allotted, softening present-tense urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The unnamed dealer's voice and interiority remain singular; the shift from archival detachment to the residue of Marrow’s transformation is embodied, not labelled. Motives scale cleanly: price paid (memory fog, emotional imprint). Marrow’s contradictory need—“fix people faster / break less of myself”—is dramatized through the act of inhalation and the aftermath, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jonas’s shift from profit-driven to compassion-driven is credible, but interiority stays surface-level; the locket acts as compass but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. Mara remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Earned stasis (pledging the fee) carries visible cost yet feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alyss’s longing to graft herself into community is embodied in every micro-choice; the ache she feels for the obsidian arbor is specific and visceral. Her final act of weaving reeds into the lattice crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she relinquishes her solitary craft to become “threaded” into collective memory. Lio’s presence is functional but thin; his interiority is filtered through Alyss and never pressures her choice. The earned shift from peripheral to grafted is legible and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eira’s identity as illustrator-turned-time-sculptor is specific and embodied; tactile handling of stylus and pendant links obsession and craft. Micro-choices (dipping the stylus into borrowed seconds) charge the final renunciation without sentimentality. Internal contradiction—guilt vs imperative—simmers beneath action rather than stated. Closure cost is legible: stylus cracked, pockets emptied, a path closed even as new cadence opens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eridian’s interiority is vivid—his refusal to abandon the “mathematics of emotion” drives every micro-choice; the ache over Lio is embodied in nightly measurements and the orchard’s pulse. The final renunciation (thanking silence instead of demanding return) is earned and costly. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Protagonist's invisibility motif and cataloguing compulsion are embodied through tactile beats (copper wire, muslin bag) and a late micro-choice to surrender anonymity for the student's sake; the contradiction between lifelong concealment and sudden partial revelation is legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is lush, contradiction embedded (“reluctant metamorphosis” vs surrender). Micro-choices—plucking leaf, pressing it, yielding to sap—feel botanical, specific, and escalate stakes. Cost (losing full humanity) legible; final stance is Earned Stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlin’s insomnia, wry earnestness, and need to “thresh meaning” are embodied through restless micro-choices—mixing pigments, trudging the causeway, painting the spiral. The final covenant with remembering shows earned change with cost. Adra’s archival identity is thinner but still presses choice. Interiority stays concrete; no stock therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arden’s “compass of small marvels” and Mara’s missed prophecy create clear, contradictory motives that collide at the pearl; their micro-choices (whistling, card slap) reveal interior stakes. The final renunciation—leaving the pearl—earns its cost because both have glimpsed what possession would steal. Interiority is embodied (“cupped the glowing sphere that hummed against his pulse”) rather than labeled. Only the reflected doubles feel generic, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Karima’s interiority is vivid—salt bookmarking her coat, gauze-wrapped valve—but her agency is largely observational; the decisive act is the council’s vote, not her own. The contradiction between “reactively visionary” and passive listening is hinted but never dramatized as a cost-bearing choice. Micro-choices (spacing recalls, placing the valve on the sill) are character-specific yet low-stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis, but the cost is collective, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling certainty tingled along her spine”), but the final choice—offering the truth “I pretend routes matter more than destinations”—is stated rather than dramatized in the moment, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Soraya’s skeptical kindness is embodied in micro-choices—touching the tile, uncapping the pen, sealing the journal—each carrying visible cost. Interior contradiction (distrust vs duty) plays out in real time, culminating in earned renunciation of pure skepticism. Mentor’s regret and whale memories are filtered through her biased perception, never explained. Final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she leaves the journal behind, accepting guardianship of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Callix’s ennui and thirst for endings are embodied in every micro-choice; the shard’s pulse against his ribs is a literal cost. Interior contradiction—boredom vs. mortal curiosity—drives the scene. The final renunciation of boredom is earned by the spatial mutiny he barely survives. Only the “dimensionally aware” label feels slightly expository, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior calculus of “fair trade” is embodied in micro-choices—loosening the glass shard nightly, calculating exchange rates inside the body bag—yet the minister’s ethical objection is sketched more as mouthpiece than crucible, keeping the relational pressure one-sided and capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calix’s interiority is vivid—his “incandescent restraint” and trembling patience embody the cost of witnessing future grief. The contradiction between archival duty and personal horror is dramatized when he keeps writing while “his own heartbeat sounded like distant shovels.” The final renunciation—hiding the notepad and rehearsing an ordinary greeting—earns its cost through prior absorption of the town’s fate. One notch below 9.0 because the birth-date whisper feels slightly abstract, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “death-certificate error” identity is dramatized through micro-choices like pocketing the poison label and slipping it under the container door. Motive—collecting memories—drives every beat. The final renunciation of identity is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: the “ghost” label is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s skeptical myth-buster identity is embodied through tactile micro-choices—winding cello strings, pressing shell to ear—rather than labels. Interior contradiction surfaces when her arrogance is confronted by the sailor’s forgiving laughter, forcing a visible cost: the snapped string and renunciation of any fixed compass. The final “gift” of reimagining is earned by prior humiliation and loss, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—orderly intuition vs. carnival chaos—drives every beat; the chip’s weight in her jacket crystallizes the cost of protecting family and city. The dual-allegiance tension is embodied, not stated, and the final exhale shows earned endurance with visible price. Minor slip: Tajo’s motives remain off-page, reducing relationship crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Halina’s interiority is concrete: the nervous fog on her visor (beat 14); the refusal to shout when she chooses chemistry (beat 6); the embodied mineral-smell and static on the tongue (beat 31) all show an individual mind. Flawed knowledge—doubt that the archives will ever convey sensorial sorrow—drives her solo commentary. The earned renunciation at the end is visible: she shoulders the silence the drones cannot capture and the cracked grain that will never measure again, accepting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s blindness is embodied through tactile listening and micro-choices; Rowan’s interiority is thin but serviceable. The final toss of the drone crystallizes her earned mastery and the cost of trust. No contradictory impulses surface in Rowan, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Morrow’s skepticism collides with wonder in embodied micro-choices (tracing vapor, kneeling at the grate). His arc from ink to spoken atlas is earned, with the cost of abandoning print legible in the final beat. Interiority stays concrete and profession-specific. Minor: Yara’s status pressure is hinted but not fully leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is embodied and stakes her identity against the town’s memory; Marek’s cryptic guidance is consistent yet never over-explained. The final choice to stay and carry the fork is earned by the walking ritual and the tear-tracked moment of recognition. Minor slip: Marek’s decades of patience are asserted rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional caution vs. gnawing curiosity—are embodied in micro-choices (overriding instinct, micro-thruster ballet). The scholar’s dying refusal to inhale again crystallizes the cost of obsession, earning Mara’s quiet renunciation of the sunset’s memory. Secondary pressure from the scholar is minimal but sufficient to tilt her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s motives—driven by shame and the hunger to outwrite ridicule—are cleanly embodied in embodied micro-choices; the interior conflict between inventing truth and discovering it powers the final renunciation without moralising.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory awe and terror under Seraphine’s presence are embodied in micro-choices (bowing, steadying among crucibles, cradling the apple). The final renunciation—accepting her dissolution—carries visible cost in his hollowed-yet-resonant heart. One slip: “lovingly venomous” is repeated rather than deepened, a label that never gains new texture.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Wren’s interiority is vivid—her “hauntingly optimistic heart beats like a gull’s wing” embodies the trait and drives her to prick her finger and feed the loom. The contradiction between hope and ruin is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (touching sailor knots, sewing shards) reveal hierarchy of values. Closure cost—blood, opened corridor—earns the endurance/renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; exile’s ache is shown through tactile micro-choices (brushing moss, fitting the peg). The final renunciation—staying to tend stories—carries visible cost (foregoing departure) and is seeded early. Minor slip: “cautious enchantment” repeats as label rather than evolving.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mirielle’s vocation and her private hunger for “meaning in the margins” give her a sharp, active lens; the clipboard micro-choices (noting glyphs, accepting chalk) externalize interior stakes. Palimpsest functions more as oracle than counter-pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is thin, yet her final decision to sketch beside the drain crystallizes a cost (she steps from observer to participant). Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the emoticon-chalk keys feel idiosyncratic rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selis’s interiority is vivid—her needle trembles, her laughter masks calculation, her “foolish” smile is weaponized. The contradiction between public guise and private intent is embodied in micro-choices (dropping the spool, touching flame to absent daybook). Marshal Voren’s brief appearance supplies external pressure that tests her disguise. Cost is felt: she forfeits her daybook and must flee before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eline’s contradictory impulses—tenderness vs. armor—are embodied in the shard’s sting and the voiced apology; the interior arc from paralysis to compassionate decision is credible and costly. The final renunciation of silence is earned by prior pain and the spirits’ staged memory. Minor: “cryptic medium” remains more label than dramatized vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Introspective narrator shows embodied contradiction—wanting both control and mercy—while micro-choices (slipping coral into pocket, pressing cast to chest) reveal value hierarchy; final ‘translator of frightened hearts’ is earned under fire. One minor drift into therapeutic abstraction at “lotus-hearted ache” slightly cools the pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina’s contradictory impulse—yearning for joy while fearing remembrance—remains embodied yet understated; the moment her touch unlocks her own child-form lands as credible reconfiguration with felt cost, though interiority skirts a hairline into therapeutic abstraction (“revelation struck like bells”).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ada’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (certainty vs curiosity) act simultaneously in scene. The hobo nickel and her grandfather’s instruction anchor motive without exposition. Final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost as the city’s fixed murals dissolve into shifting wonder. Minor slip: “methodically playful” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s rogue-scholar identity is shown through micro-choices—hiding keycodes in footnotes, abandoning tenure—yet interiority stays embodied. The final “abandoned tenure, address, even preferred pronouns” crystallizes cost. Mira’s cryptic pruning and quicksilver grin create immediate status tension. Only slight drift: the “charming” label is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mareth’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shell yet answering the postcard—are embodied in trembling hands and glowing vines; the final renunciation of insomnia carries visible cost as the poems “dream on their own.” Interiority is concrete, but the elder-self remains a symbolic projection rather than a second character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orielle’s interior contradiction—systematic caretaker vs. foxglove regret—drives every beat; her micro-choice to descend after mending the chime crystallizes the arc with visible cost (abandoning safe routine). Embodied emotion in “glass orchids rustled…cautious bells” grounds her shift. Flaw (regret) complicates rather than decorates. The final smile carries earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ada’s “carefully reckless” nature is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—dipping the quill, tying ribbons, humming chords—that visibly risk the archive’s wrath and her mother’s legacy. Interior contradiction (yearning vs. fear) stays active in-scene. Final bow and unfinished tune show earned cost: she forecloses personal vengeance for communal harmony. Minor slip: the mother backstory is summarized, not felt in a present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her clattering heart, sweat mingling with ash—but the “encrypted compassion” concept is asserted more than dramatized; the final tremble is earned yet the moral ambiguity feels slightly smoothed rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marietta’s contradictory impulses—fear of betrayal vs. need to trust—are embodied in the micro-choice to release the pigeon; the cost (re-exposure) is felt. Interiority is specific, never generic, and her past exile sharpens present stakes. The final renunciation (burning the papers) seals a path with visible ash. Only the graduate’s trembling plea feels slightly expository, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is rich, self-contradictory, and embodied; every micro-choice is filtered through loss and hunger with visible stakes. Flap-level resolve controls outcomes, shifts under camera-light, and persists to the earned renunciation—“stand apart so the wind can finish singing.” No stock therapy-speak taints the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her belief that the feather “still smelled of migration” is embodied and stakes her identity. The micro-choice to leave the feather behind at the airlock crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Lio’s presence is thin; his dialogue is functional but not a crucible. Overall, a strong single-POV portrait with one earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—surf “hissing like fading applause,” “tea left too long in sorrow”—and her conjecture loops back to alter tactics. Yet the final choice (gathering glyphs to restore paths) feels slightly abstract; the embodied cost is more shimmer than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Velasco’s interiority is poetic but abstract; his “midnight philosopher” stance is asserted rather than embodied. The five volunteers are sketched more by archetype than contradiction, so pressure on Velasco remains conceptual. The bishop’s release at the end is a graceful renunciation, yet its emotional cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sable's interiority is always embodied (bare soles on dew, moonstone on tongue). Her contradictory impulses—“anchor myself, yet write the world”—are dramatized under pressure; renunciation of exile becomes earned anchoring to purpose with visible cost. Flawed self-preservation against nostalgia manifests as poetic risk-taking that shapes the final beat. Character voice unique, no stock trait labels cruft.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “pockets clinking with shards” and “fingers hovering just above the surface” show contradiction between reverence and urgency. Motivation to finish her mother’s work and “illuminate value in the mundane” is clear and escalates to the decisive repair. The final smile and recognition of “calibration” mark earned change with visible cost. Minor slip: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rowan’s contradictory impulses—stoic caretaker vs. guilt-laden bargainer—surface in the moment he offers Juniper the shard; the interior contradiction is embodied rather than labeled. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: he relinquishes a fragment of his mother’s box, a visible cost that forecloses his prior solitary ritual. Juniper’s arrival is the crucible; their shared silence alters Rowan’s stewardship of innocence. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “bargained innocence” that edges toward diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ora’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “serene upheaval” and “measured curiosity” are shown through tactile micro-choices (calibrating the gauge, folding the parchment boat). Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the final release. The only gap is that the parallel-timeline empathy is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the cost slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s sensory-driven interiority is vivid and consistent; her contradictory impulses—sell the data vs. guard the corridors—are dramatized in the final renunciation with visible cost. The profession “corridor echo cartographer” is not just label but shapes every perception and micro-choice. One minor slip: the diary dust moment leans summary rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; Ariste’s trembling hands and the narrator’s breath-cadence anchor contradictory impulses. The borrowed heartbeat is dramatized through micro-choices (steady breathing, final palm-to-stone) rather than labels. Cost is felt when the child’s laughter rises—proof the circuit completed—yet Ariste’s own heart now beats alone, a quiet renunciation of further miracles.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Petra’s interior contradiction—eloquence vs futility—is embodied in her grip on the clipboard and her refusal to smile at the end; the joint-stewardship clause forces a visible cost (both leaders balk) and earns her quiet belief. The brass limb and whispered benediction give Rourke and Laure distinct micro-choices under pressure. Minor slip: “price of redemption” is named rather than dramatized until the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Serafina’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. vanity, sentiment vs. control—are dramatized in every micro-choice (cracking the capsule, diverting caravans). The steel-heart/hoarded-memory tension is embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation is earned and costly. Fyodor’s single tear refracts their shared compromise, adding relational pressure without crowding the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirelle’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “bodily poetic” fingers untangling threads, the hidden name beneath rouge—but the final smile feels slightly under-costed; the city’s transformation is legible, yet her personal price is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s serene composure and ethical drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—inked vouchers, clipped puppet strings, candle tilts—yet the interior contradiction between polished detachment and covert purpose remains more asserted than dramatized until the final renunciation, which lands with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pearl’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (honor vs. impermanence) act simultaneously in the knot-tying beat. The final renunciation—letting the structures crumble—earns its cost through prior causality and the monarch’s aureole. Minor slip: “esoteric realist” is label-speak early on, but it’s quickly overwritten by action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elien’s interior contradiction—guilt over the kiln accident versus the need to forgive himself—drives every micro-choice; the moment self-blame melts visibly alters the aurora and authorizes the rope’s cooperation. His “technically gentle” trait constrains the entire procedure (breath instead of force, whalebone tweezers), and the final renunciation—leaving with empty hands—costs him possession of the artifact he just forged, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s paradoxical blindness to the present is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—pressing the seal to his forehead, dancing in ruinous darkness—so interior contradiction is lived, not declared. The final “second heartbeat” image crystallizes an earned endurance that costs him his remaining sighted time, satisfying the 9+ test. Minor slack: the engineer’s laughter is received knowledge rather than a discovered motive that pressures him.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miserly Naram-ben driven by fear and wonder in equal measure sparks the central quest; his frugality collides with cosmic generosity. Compression of internal calculus is concrete and scene-tied; the moment he places the astrolabe atop the tile crystallizes cost. The only ding: his final laughter feels slightly explanatory rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maro’s paradoxical pacifist-schemer identity is embodied in every micro-choice; Tyra’s cellular surrender is earned through tactile memory and visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the absence of Tyra’s own POV keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Haleh’s interiority is vivid—her breathing syncs with the orchard, her fractured sextant hums like “an unfinished mouth”—but the dream remains an external quarry rather than a contradictory impulse inside her; the final fusion is earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seraphin’s motives—renewal, redemption, generational bridging—are embodied in tactile gestures and micro-decisions (offering the ribbon, choosing stories as payment). Contradictory impulses (guild exile vs orchard loyalty) are held in vivid interiority without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“lungs overflowing and eyes stinging”), but the final renunciation—accepting stewardship—leans on abstract summary rather than a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ora’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. rescue reflex—surface in micro-choices (cataloging vs. saving philosophers). The diary’s glow anchors her shifting priorities, but Marrow’s paradoxical guilt feels sketched rather than embodied. Closure cost is legible: the pollen memory is irretrievably spent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the twin’s fatigue-taped smile and the narrator’s palm-burning card anchor contradictory impulses. The final choice—to stitch an exit rather than stay or leave—earns its cost through prior sibling bond and shared “trapped freedom.” Minor slip: the brother’s off-stage research is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting motive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“softly determined sigh,” “steam rising in orderly spirals”—and her micro-choices (tugging rope, pressing wax) align with her motive to “translate confusion into clarity.” The final renunciation—door vanishing, seal now dual-imprinted—earns its cost through prior causality. Yet the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps her just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ripple-Mark’s want for interior stillness is dramatized through embodied micro-choices; the ice-shard crack listening beats embody contradiction, and the final renunciation of bottled silence is earned with visible cost. Flawed desire remains active in scene and drives ending.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lioh’s longing for lost light and reverence for chance anchor his every micro-choice; the retrocognitive trait forces the shard into his path, yet the internal arc is summary-heavy for its cost—epiphanies arrive in dream-bites rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve yet fearing petrification—drives every micro-choice; the final omission of her own longing costs her ego-space and is embodied in the “sting.” Only the mentor’s warning is summary, not dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cyril’s combustive dreamer archetype is embodied through tactile black-powder scent and micro-choices (pocketing the knot, twirling rag). Internal contradictions—playful defiance vs. gravity—are dramatized in decision beats, and his final stance crystallizes stakes with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marella’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm against the grotto floor, the hum that is “not aiming at the cicada but at the hollows.” The contradiction between her habitual oblique observation and the need to speak directly is dramatized in the vision-branching beat. The final micro-choice—breaking the hum to speak first—carries visible cost in Quillon’s “relief pooling like phosphorescence.” Only the slight over-articulation of “texture of time” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the claustrophobia vs sky tension drives every micro-choice. The final reconciliation with Father is earned through the hush-vial act and carries visible relational cost. Minor slip: “bottled quiet” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gerard’s interiority is embodied in gesture and breath; his mission to “teach silence” is dramatized through micro-choices (meter, vial, pacing) that visibly cost him effort. Liora’s shift from vibrating notebooks to stillness is earned by shared breathing and the storm-glass payoff. The only cap is that Gerard’s flaw/ambiguity remains under-explored, keeping him slightly archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kestrel’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“futuristic nostalgia pulsed in Kestrel's chest”), but the renunciation at the end is slightly under-motivated; the murals hint at clarity over power, yet the leap from seeing to renouncing feels compressed. Still, her micro-choices (planting the shard, slicing it) are character-specific and carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—tidy endings vs. the messy promise to Declin—are dramatized through micro-choices (placing the ring, pressing her palm to his spine). The final renunciation of daylight is earned and carries visible cost. Interiority is embodied and specific; only the “shadow keeper” label edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cassia’s contradictory impulses—escape from predatory sparkle vs. hunger for honest mischief—are embodied in every beat, from pocketing the bolt to forging diamond spores. The bolt-as-necklace is a visible cost of her earned stasis. Interiority is specific (“smelled somehow of salt”) and never drifts into therapy-speak. The only minor slip is the off-stage farmhands who dilute status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iria’s contradictory impulses—loyalty to employer vs independent plan—are visible in micro-choices (hiding the cylinder, pocketing wax). Flaw-driven mistake: hesitation risks curfew bell. Earned renunciation at closure forecloses revolution path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Caron’s interiority is rich—war-hollowed knight seeking “script larger than war”—but the turn from puppet-master to poet-of-possibility is asserted more than dramatized; the final surrender feels pre-ordained rather than earned by visible micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—protective hope against personal grief—drive every micro-choice. The button hand-off crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes the talisman that once steadied her own exit from care. Jordan’s minimal page-time still registers as individual, not type. Only the slight over-articulation of “tactfully hopeful” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s quiet rebellion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—scavenging the key, tracing the puddle-map, wading into the lagoon—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both fears discovery and steps onto water, a credible leap rooted in prior resourcefulness. The final fusion of memory and flesh carries visible cost: she becomes the archive, voice and heartbeat altered forever. Only a slight excess of reflective summary early on keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kieran’s interiority is vivid—his nostalgia for his mother’s clarinet, the ache in his chest, the “vested hush” as a felt garment—but the story withholds any contradictory impulse that would complicate his resolve; he proceeds with serene certainty. The final renunciation (silence over speech) is earned by the prior rehearsal beats and carries visible cost in the “chest aching,” yet the absence of internal friction keeps it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Briony’s meticulous patience and quiet wonder are embodied in every micro-choice (sorting, placing moon-specks, climbing the living staircase). The interior contradiction—scientific order vs. folkloric surrender—plays out in real time and culminates in an earned acceptance of caretaker destiny. Cost is felt: she trades solitary certainty for communal prophecy. No secondary pressure from other characters, but her own flaw (over-certainty) is confronted and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Milo’s curiosity and vocational compulsion are consistent (“broken-clock tinkerer”), yet his final decision to smash the compass lacks visible emotional cost anchored in prior contradiction; the interiority feels more lyrical than crucible-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurora’s guilt and alchemical identity are embodied through tactile ritual; the confession etched in tin is earned by prior jealousy. Jory’s cinder-form externalizes cost without slipping into sentimentality. Micro-choices (dropping coin, striking anvil) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight reserve: Jory’s minimal agency keeps relationship crucible from full ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eluan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “modestly fearless” trait is tested when the tooth rattles and he must shift from amusing to guiding. The final renunciation—recorking the clear tooth as reminder—carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One micro-choice (uncorking the vial) directly alters tactics and forecloses half-measures.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the survivor’s trauma-driven memory, proprioceptive enhancement, and quest for “mathematics of mercy” all shape micro-choices. The final stance—accepting mercy as transformation—earns its cost through prior pain and the strap’s re-weighting. No stock phrasing; contradictions (math vs. flesh) are dramatized. Only a hairline slip: the “thousand volts” line edges toward summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Irida’s motives (honour overlooked histories, translate light) are clear and shape every decision; the lens exchange, Aven collaboration, rooftop climb all flow from trait-driven wants. Interiority stays concrete (“felt the tug of overlooked histories”). Micro-choice on the bridge (“lifted the shard toward the moon”) crystallizes stakes with audible physical cost. Aven is secondary but his exhaustion and final whisper register price.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlen’s “quest to discover what ceilings hide” is dramatized through micro-choices—prying the panel, pocketing the mainspring—each with visible cost (ghosts’ gratitude, dawn’s exhale). Interiority is embodied and specific; the ghosts’ murmurs and the “calliope” heartbeat ground his fear and wonder. The final renunciation—leaving the lights on—earns its poignancy because earlier beats have tied his identity to listening, not fixing. One hairline slip: the phrase “weightless burden” repeats without new shading.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ellis’s interiority—“he secretly adored anything that destabilizes perfect systems”—anchors motive, and the final act of folding the page under his tongue crystallizes a tri-focal identity with visible cost; yet the contradiction between love of fragility and deliberate chaos could be embodied more viscerally mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Velen’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs revolutionary longing—are embodied in every beat; the shard’s decoded confession forces an earned renunciation of easy victory and reopens his dormant commitment. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with cost. Only a slight over-articulation of “burnished sorrow” keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clay’s interiority is vivid—his “fingers that never tremble” and the visceral aversion to dishonesty anchor motive. The final acceptance of permanent truth-telling is earned by the prior causality of wilting near lies. One slip: the guardians’ chord-speech is more atmospheric than crucible, so relationship pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“knees shaking,” “bottled droplet shivers open”), but the final renunciation—stepping through the question-mark doorway—leans more on lyric inevitability than on dramatized internal contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully foreshadowed by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iona’s interiority is vivid and embodied—salt on lips, calloused hands, chisel pausing for wood’s angle—yet the “timewoven alliances” revelation arrives as external exposition rather than internal contradiction; her final acceptance feels inevitable but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—artistic ambition vs. filial debt—drive every beat. The final choice to paint the phosphorescent mural is earned by the cathedral revelation and carries visible cost (fading dawn). Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until the mural scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—duty to archive vs. need to witness—drives every beat; embodied seizures and micro-choice to descend anchor motive. Final renunciation of remote safety costs her bodily autonomy and is earned by prior retrocognitive pain. Secondary apparition pressures her stance, crystallizing the ledger as revolt. No slips, but limited page space keeps contradiction from full bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—guilt vs. the flare of renewed purpose—is embodied in the amber bottle and the act of feeding it town fragments. His micro-choices (walking lanes aloud, smashing mortar) align with motive and foreclose retreat. The final self-sacrifice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “reheat” as metaphor feels slightly abstract mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Loranth’s interior contradiction—archivist’s duty vs. emotional release—is embodied in micro-choices (plucking the apple, planting the core). The final renunciation of shelving grief in favor of letting it seed the city carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by childhood awe. Flaw: the childhood memory, though re-used, remains slightly abstract, blunting the interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Alma’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—furious yet tranquil—surface in micro-choices like exhaling numbers into the vortex. The cost of borrowed time is dramatized as silver threading her hair, a felt price that forecloses youth. Motivation is rooted in lineage and soil, not abstract greed. One slip: the phrase “texture of borrowed time” edges toward label-speak before it is re-earned in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s curiosity is embodied in the quartz-petal anemometer and the microclimate log; her internal conflict—listen vs. alarm—drives every beat. The final switch-flick is earned by prior data and carries visible cost (trust vs. lives). Minor: “credibly curious” is once label-adjacent but immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Janus’s spiritual curiosity and empathic impulse drive every beat; the interior contradiction between protocol and wonder is embodied in the micro-choice to trace rather than seal. The final release of the lantern glass crystallizes his shift from faked strength to vulnerability, with the cost of leaving his own fissures exposed. Minor deduction for one reflective block that slightly exceeds 20 %.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orin’s mute astonishment and tranquil perception are embodied through deliberate stillness and listening; the choice to accept the covenant is earned by his prior exile and need for purpose. Interior contradiction surfaces when his silence collides with the ghosts’ plea, forcing a non-verbal vow. The final image—his aged likeness in the glass—shows cost: perpetual stewardship without voice. Some emotional labeling (“solitude throbbed for purpose”) edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Basil’s interiority is vivid and embodied (the velvet silence of absent instants), but his final renunciation—“we must invite them”—feels slightly under-motivated; the communal impulse arrives as stated value rather than demonstrated contradiction. Anika’s pressure is present yet thin; her one line of dialogue carries subtext but no status shift. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with visible cost, but the micro-choice to share the loom lacks prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority (mending the incomplete) is embodied through tactile choices—bare feet in silt, hands on torn kite, feather as splint—but the boy’s motivation flips from frustration to cheer without visible cost or micro-choice that dramatizes change; still, the adult-child dynamic under pressure crystallizes through joint labor.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—accepting death yet striving for legacy—are embodied in her meticulous grafting of copper to living wood; her final renunciation of survival for resonance is earned and costly. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinching. The priest’s brief presence supplies external pressure that crystallizes permission without diluting single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iris Vale’s interior skepticism crystallizes in every beat; the choice to “begin an artificial pilgrimage” is earned by prior defiance of academy authority and meteorite voice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Coachman’s interiority is vivid—he translates foam, parses gull jokes, recites reef-Latin—but the final “understood that battle lines could be redrawn by chlorophyll” is an unearned epiphany; prior beats show no interior contradiction about the ethics of gardening war. Motivation is consistent yet static; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values. Still, embodied emotion and occupation-specific worldview are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orin’s interior contradiction—scavenger turned translator who both trusts and distrusts silence—drives every micro-choice; the final decision to walk toward an unknown city is earned by prior embodied memories of loss and the waxed leaf’s tactile promise. Barrow’s agency (nosing the cylinder, clawing the trapdoor) supplies external pressure that forces Orin’s stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the line “the act of walking would translate distance into closeness all the same,” a renunciation of settled safety.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; contradictory impulses around abandonment and duty surface in each motion toward the glass. The micro-choices—pressing the compass to the viewport, killing the last lamp, folding the sketch-ship, shouldering the pack—carry escalating cost and crystallize a hierarchy of values: legacy over safety, ritual over protocol. The final walk-out earns full resonance because the prior beats trace how ritual must also become locomotion; ambiguity and flaw remain intact to the last footstep.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kestrel’s contradictory impulses—thief’s daring vs. apprentice’s reverence—are embodied in bleeding gloves and theatrical bows; the final choice to descend with only wonder earned feels costly. Interiority is vivid, but the Curator’s sudden trust leans on lore shorthand rather than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ezra’s interior contradiction—archivist vs. pawnless player—drives every micro-choice; the nod he records is a visible cost that seals joint stewardship. Calypso’s benevolent ruthlessness is embodied in the recorder placement and the cataloguing of hesitations, not merely labeled. Relationship crucible forces Ezra from lone pilgrim to co-custodian with a single neck-muscle gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ground glass behind the eyes”), but the arc from buried talents to active seeding is compressed; the shift feels more asserted than earned, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Contradictory impulses (brilliance vs mercy) press Rhaun’s choices, cost of self-forgiveness drives the final reversal, and interiority is embodied in fidgeting and tactile work with threads and hedges—exemplary flaw integration.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera’s contradictory need to remember her failures while bargaining for forgiveness is embodied in her spiral-painting and poem-exchange; the Marshal’s shift from law-bound to co-creator is credibly seeded by the dust ritual. Both carry visible cost—her forfeited absolution, his torn warrant—yet interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction that blurs micro-choice granularity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Brielle’s interior contradiction—doubt alloyed with duty—drives every micro-choice; the key ring charm embodies the mentor-shaped void and physically alters her stance under pressure. The final self-inflicted kintsugi crack is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible bodily cost. Minor: the mentor vanishing “into the brine” is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradictory pull between nostalgia and renunciation is dramatized in the cave when he kneels to paint the mirror. The final smile and whispered “Promise kept” crystallize an earned stasis with visible cost—he forfeits the shell and the mirror’s reflection of his younger selves. Minor slip: “intimately aloof” is asserted more than enacted in the quay beats.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s interiority is vivid—his “collection of kindness” and the vial ritual embody motive—but the final choice (whisper vs. horn) is more faith than contradiction; cost is felt yet not sharply personal. Bram’s limping tenderness supplies relational pressure, but the shift in their dynamic is gentle rather than crucible-hot.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marrow’s patchwork body and lunar-tied purpose are vivid and embodied; her renunciation to stay and steward backward journeys is earned by the visible cost of bleeding the hydraulics dry. Interiority is specific, but the voice of the caller remains abstract, slightly blurring relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s interior contradiction—rational method vs. involuntary truth-telling—drives every beat; the memory he fears is embodied and costly. The micro-choice to confess under the eye is earned and alters tactics. Secondary pressure from Mara is brief but sharp. Only the sister remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oswald’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “softly persistent curiosity” drives every micro-choice. The borrowed-memory conceit externalizes his loneliness without therapy-speak, and pinning the Edelweise to mimic a stranger’s heartbeat is a precise, costly gesture. The final bow acknowledges burden and privilege, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory empiricism vs. intuition is embodied in the ants-and-chip sequence; the final embrace carries visible cost (door seals, path gone). Sister’s absence is felt but she appears only at closure, so relationship crucible is off-page. Interiority is specific, but “fever dreams” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sereya’s disenchantment-to-abdication arc is embodied in every beat: her nightmares compress to the bleeding starlight, her “softly commanding” voice cracks when she kneels and offers crown back to orb. Riall shifts from captain to pilgrim through single unarmored exhale under fireflies—relationship reframed without speeching it. Internal contradiction—queen/criminal—remains active even in last footstep down ridge. Cost of name-erasement is legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cressida’s contradictory hunger to bottle “presence” while surrendering mastery is dramatized in tactile beats (pressing the shell to Roan’s burn, scattering colors). Interiority stays concrete—“tasting salt and star-dust”—and the final renunciation carries visible cost. Roan’s secondary pressure is clear but his interiority is thinner, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied ("metallic bees," "feral nostalgia"), but the causal link between jealousy and the final revision is asserted rather than dramatized; the paper-plane beat is poetic yet feels like a shortcut rather than a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amira’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between her lost sense and her tactile precision is dramatized in every micro-choice. The moment she “listens to that tiny sound… a way of smelling with her ears” crystallizes her earned shift. Laleh’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters the clamp’s fate. The only minor slip is a touch of therapeutic self-labeling (“nose empty yet heart replete”) that slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seren’s interiority is embodied and specific; the scars-as-lanterns choice at the end is earned by the ritual of inscription and the blood-ink beat. Motivation (transform scars into stories) is dramatized, not declared. The single micro-choice—cutting her palm to mix wound with remedy—carries visible cost and forecloses fear. No secondary character pressure, but Master Yulo’s silent witness is sufficient for the scene’s crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marisol’s contradictory motives—gossip-monger vs. penitent exorcist—are embodied in the lilac bait and the Tesla coil; her micro-choice to play the adagio through her own body carries visible cost (electric possession) and forecloses the path of mere voyeurism. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, though the final “overdue apology” line edges toward summary rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sole on-page character has a clear, metaphysical motive—to witness and expose the lie of cosmic illusion—and this steadily escalates into the final choice of enduring the resounding hush of unified truths. Interiority is idiosyncratic (dictionary pages printed with “Now”) and embodied emotion propels multiple beats. The experienced change (renouncing separate self) is earned and re-priced under pressure. A minor price tag for near-perfect execution: technobabble placeholders like “glyphs” never individuate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Trond’s obsessive need to understand what clocks “really measure” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—counting backwards, tracing the crack, turning the key—each tightening the stake. Interior contradiction surfaces in his simultaneous reverence for and suspicion of the system. The final renunciation (healing the crack, resealing the billet) costs him the chance to keep the mirror-sand, earned by prior causality. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—guardian vs. surrenderer—drives every micro-choice; the moment she pockets the warm button, the trait “spatially gifted” becomes a literal tool for folding space. The final embrace with her echo costs her the safety she once policed, a renunciation legible in the new silence that “germinated.” Only a hairline slip: the phrase “physics of letting go” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Celeste’s compulsive note-taking, subway scrawl decoding, and final heel-strike on the lantern all spring from her need to reconcile chaos and pattern; the contradictory impulses (gambler’s superstition vs. probabilist rigor) are embodied in each micro-choice. The lantern-shattering act carries visible cost—loss of the last intact relic—and crystallizes her shift from taming odds to tolerating uncertainty. Interiority is specific and embodied (“tears blurred her vision, refracting shelves into prisms”). Minor slip: the teenage boy’s brief appearance adds no pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“voice of the forgotten digits,” “sick rose”); the operator’s contradictory impulse—harvesting connection from estrangement—drives every beat. The final choice to speak to his childhood self is earned by the long-cultivated estrangement motif and costs the operator the last shield of distance. One slip: the florist and poet feel more devices than crucible partners, so relationship pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Archivist’s interior contradiction—duty vs wonder—drives every beat; embodied emotion (“ink-stained palm,” “haunted euphoria settle between ribs”) grounds stakes. Micro-choice to insert own note into locket reconfigures past and future with visible cost: custodianship now perpetual. Flawed restraint—waiting for the widow’s cue—complicates agency yet feels consistent. Character reads singular, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pamphleteer’s loneliness is embodied and drives every micro-choice; Milo’s courteous anarchy is vivid yet his interior remains opaque. Motivations stay consistent, but the final reciprocity feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than wrested from flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oriole’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertip reading of moss, the ring warming “like dawn cupped in metal.” The final renunciation (slipping the ring into the pool) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “maps inked in sorrow but bordered by tenderness” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interpreter’s interior contradiction—yearning to rewrite yet fearing further harm—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation (to listen rather than edit) is earned by the embodied cost of cold basalt and sealed ink. Emotions are rendered through physical anchors (clogged pen, pricked finger) rather than labels. Flawed past action (“planting the wrong seeds”) complicates present tactics and forces the climactic stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “joyful sorrow beating beneath her ribs” embodies the twin impulse to remember and to forget. Micro-choices (dipping fingers, pressing the empty shutter) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Harlan’s disembodied counsel supplies pressure but remains off-page, so relationship crucible is muted. Closure cost is felt: Harlan dissolves, Mara’s anonymity is sealed, musicians keep wordless hues.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ash’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s heat vs. librarian’s tenderness—are embodied in micro-choices (pressing the tapestry to her chest, tracing stitches). The final renunciation of the ember carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ira’s interiority is vivid—her quiet rebellion surfaces in embodied micro-choices (tapping the stump, lemon-juice annotations) that escalate to collective action. The contradiction between obedience and revolt is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation—refusing to remain observer—carries visible cost as the experiment slips the leash. Only the sister’s grief feels slightly generalized, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlin’s gait-based perception and “calculated spontaneity” credo are embodied in every micro-choice; the final renunciation—letting the ladder vanish—costs him immediate access to the smuggling route and is earned by prior beats. Interior contradiction surfaces when curiosity collides with professional caution. Liora’s presence sharpens the crucible, but her interiority is only gestured at, slightly limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist’s interior contradiction—grief locked against the need to release it—drives every beat; the micro-choice to surrender the memory is embodied in the tear-cooled night air and the opened door. Guardian’s silence functions as active pressure, not absence. Cost is felt: the memory is gone, the water keeps the light, and the brother’s echo is transmuted rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his odd hearing, the “forests of second thoughts” desire—but the final renunciation (“only slow-growing shade”) is slightly under-costed; we feel the grotto’s approval more than his own forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses (applause vs. quiet rebellion) are dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “lonely throb” and “tidal animal beneath his ribs” anchor motive. The scrimshaw’s power over others contrasts with his own sealed heart, creating credible contradiction. Final surrender is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost (“raw and exact”). Minor: the leap from “marching orders” to rowing feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marrow’s interior contradiction—silence vs. performative narration—drives every beat; her gift of the lamp crystallizes Ithica’s shift from painted smile to remade hush. The micro-choice to blow across cedar channels (not merely light it) embodies the cost of compliance. Moral ambiguity is embodied, not labeled. Minor: Ithica’s grief remains slightly generalized; more bodily specificity would lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid—e.g., “tuning forks within my ribs”—and the shared compact with the poet crystallizes motive. Yet the poet’s own contradictory impulses remain off-stage, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—wanting to prove beauty in broken hues while fearing pity—drives every micro-choice; the embodied shift from tasting temperature to shared breath with Goran crystallizes earned humility and cost. The “innocently cunning” trait shows in silent plant codes and the deliberate lopsided tear, not labels. Final hand-in-hand return to the furnace forecloses isolation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s embodied interiority (throat scars tightening, knuckles humming) and micro-choice to sing imperfectly rather than purely reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; the final renunciation of performance for connection carries visible cost in the “empty hands and resonant heart.” Secondary pressure from Senka is minimal but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lenore’s grief is embodied and contradictory; her decision to tattoo the coordinates onto her own arm crystallizes self-directed sacrifice and stakes her flesh on the promise to “teach withering to bloom.” Interiority and micro-choices under pressure match her jeweler precision without lapsing into explanatory labels.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirelle’s interiority is vivid—her tactile noticing of volcanic ink, her micro-choice to let Jonas mark the tape—yet the final “responsibility shared” beat feels slightly abstract rather than embodied cost. Jonas’s curiosity is steady but never cracks under contradiction; his arc is more witness than struggle. Still, the pair’s shared ritual crystallizes a believable shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kesari’s interiority fuses exile-curiosity with scholarly guilt; the saffron veil is traded for knowledge in a believable arc and becomes visible cost at closure. Motive, flaw, and endurance form a tight triangle that forecloses safe return.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eira’s interiority is embodied in her “softly deliberate” gestures and the trembling palms that cradle the stone; her contradictory impulse—leave the sanctuary to save a grandmother who may not exist—drives the single decisive choice. The cost (irrevocable exile from the library) is felt on the page when she returns soaked and shining. Motivation is rooted in lineage and hope, not label-speak. Only the narrator’s passivity and slight emotional ventriloquism keep it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Calder’s interior contradiction—yearning for admiration versus the need for honesty—is embodied in the tactile ritual of cutting away dyed lining; the final choice to return the tail tip carries visible cost and forecloses the path of further deceit.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction vivid (paradox “closure seeker who opened wounds”), embodied pain steers choices; motivation anchors every act but late shift from self-study to altruistic conduit slips emotional continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the cotton gloves, the sigh that releases freed affection. Motivation is clear and intensifies: from seeking stored love to realizing it must circulate. The final choice (rewinding, leaving the flyer) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor deduction for a touch of abstract “unused love” phrasing that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s interiority is vivid—embodied exhaustion, moth-wing pressure, the taste of stardust—yet the final surrender of the “lantern of his own imaginings” feels slightly under-motivated; the voices’ assurance that “emptiness was sometimes the precise space” arrives as authorial fiat rather than earned contradiction. Still, his micro-choices (tracing glyphs, pressing the astrolabe to his chest) reveal a hierarchy of values that forecloses his future as dream-bearer with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s insomnia-turned-vigilance is embodied in micro-choices (checking hatches, coaxing engines) and crystallizes in the final renunciation of sleep for listening; the contradiction between exhaustion and duty is palpable. Lira functions as catalyst rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is light, yet Silas’s internal stakes and cost feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jonas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “caged instrument” metaphor and micro-choice to fit the gear into the spindle crystallize his arc. The final renunciation (“Take me to the place where questions are born”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the gear, surrender to sleep). Minor slip: the “wild frontier” refrain edges toward label-speak once too often.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lis’s interiority is embodied (knotting brow, chest-vibration) and her micro-choice to name “unused courage” propels the arc; the elders’ motives remain slightly archetypal, softening the edge needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellis’s vow to “decipher the fortress’s quiet covenant” and his final micro-choice—twisting the bolt—are embodied and costly, yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “frostbitten hope” rather than concrete contradiction. The silent-choir conceit is vivid but never tested under pressure; his muteness feels ornamental, not crucible-forged. Still, the renunciation of silence lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysar’s regally unpretentious presence is embodied in river-stone crown imagery and mirrored dais stance; Selestine’s scholar’s fervor shows in her thesis chase and pellet throw. Both have clear, escalating motives that converge on the decisive sundering. Interior contradictions are implied rather than dramatized in scene, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory motives—scientific curiosity versus embodied fear—play out in micro-choices on every floorboard tap and rope length; the final embrace of disappearance carries earned cost visible in her leaving the note and tapping her own requiem down seventy meters.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s barefoot vulnerability and “awkward confidence” are embodied in every step; the opera glasses become an extension of her gaze, not a prop. Her interior contradiction—seeking beauty amid ruin—drives each micro-choice down the ladder and back up. The final resolve to carry “music, not weapons” is earned by the stone circle’s visceral re-ordering of her bones. Cost is felt: the lingering hum in her chest is both gift and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s motives are clear and her interior contradiction—insurgent caution vs grandmotherly duty—propels her; the final pledge reads earned, but the early reflection block (garden ash→plant telepathy) tilts toward exposition, costing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Anisa’s contradictory impulses—freeze vs. act—are embodied in the thunder-triggered relapse and Malik’s fingertip rescue; the final planting ritual earns her renunciation of pure survival with visible cost. Interiority is specific (seed behind ear, dirt-lined pulse), though the “pearl of stillness” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt and artistic vocation are embodied in the tarot-mother portrait; his surrender to the drifting Moon card crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific, but the mother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices (following smoke threads, releasing the card) align with motive and flaw. No stock therapy-speak; the final darkness reads as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation (“why time slows in crisis”) is declared early and recurs, yet interiority remains largely summarized rather than dramatized; Sulin’s “serene anger” is announced, not embodied in choice or gesture. The only micro-choice—spilling the ink and accepting the risk—is compelling but happens late, so character depth pivots on a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ila’s trembling gloves and hairline crack in the frozen pane embody her contradictory impulses in scene; the micro-choice to encrypt the letter inside weather data is earned by prior interior conflict and carries visible cost (lost sterility, shared danger with Malvek). The final shared vigil on the crate crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure. Missing 9+ only because Malvek’s late entry slightly dilutes the crucible focus.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amber’s pacifism is embodied in the sheathing of the knife and her choice to offer rose cuttings; the scars on her palms and her refusal of weapons show cost. Cullin’s shift from bounty hunter to watering-can bearer is credible but sketched more than dramatized. Interiority is specific and sensory, though the father-daughter reunion relies on familiar shorthand rather than fresh contradiction. The final shared planting crystallizes a relationship change with visible, gentle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s interiority is embodied and specific (e.g., “tug on his wrist,” “colors behind his eyelids”); contradictory impulses (hunger to trap vs. empathy) act simultaneously in the release beat. The final renunciation is earned by the prior transliteration of Nethe’s gratitude, with visible cost in the freed vibrations and the quiet he now carries. Minor drift: “cool-headed” is asserted more than dramatized until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amelia’s curiosity-as-vice is vivid, embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the nib, scratching the brass). Interior contradiction—loyalty vs. accountability—drives the climax. The final renunciation (selling the estate) lands with visible cost, though the shift from fear to resolve could be more textured under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lin’s guilt is embodied in the firmware ghost and the amber ritual; contradictory impulses (flee vs. atone) play out in micro-choices like pressing amber to sternum. The final renunciation—tethering the ghost—earns its cost in the cathedral-after-bells emptiness. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “circuits inside him twitch” edges toward tech-label shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Felicity’s interiority is vivid—her “socially perceptive” gaze and chalk-as-language choices reveal layered motives. Yet the supporting trio remain sketches: the boy’s tile-flake tic is evocative but never pressures choice, the scholar and fisherman serve as thematic mirrors rather than crucibles. The earned renunciation (tidying tables) is credible, but the cost is diffuse across the group rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aarik’s barefoot ache, shard-listening, and final collective utterance embody “gentle radical” without label-speak; interior contradiction (forge-blade purpose vs. unarmed body) stays active in scene. Rima’s “warm coldness” is shown once, then asserted; her emotional ledger remains off-page, so relationship crucible is only half-forged. Micro-choice chain (kneel, place shard, speak echo) earns the renaming cost; retrocognitive flaw constrains and enables the climax. Still, secondary pressure from Rima is thin, capping excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (synesthetic “C-sharp in my nostrils”), but the janitor’s contradictory impulses remain mostly reported rather than enacted; the final “decide to be late” is earned yet feels lightly costed.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s skeptical affection is embodied in micro-choices—rolling the blister pack, cupping the candle-thought—yet the final renunciation (slowing breath to sever the link) feels slightly under-costed; we see the tactic but not the visceral price. Interior contradiction is vivid, but the moment of yielding to “willowglass hope” could carry more bodily consequence to fully earn the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ruen’s interior contradiction—Ministry duty vs. private vocation—drives every micro-choice; the fossil as anchor and the final renunciation of return crystallize a felt cost. Embodied emotion (brine on tongue, visor hues) stays specific, though “be the hinge that sings” flirts with label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lenra’s contradictory drives—preserving tradition vs. forging possibility, solitude vs. shared hearing—play out in concrete micro-choices (opening doors, sealing the jar, speaking aloud). Interiority is embodied in tactile action rather than abstract labels. The ending’s earned shift from “dictation” to “dialogue” incurs credible social cost: relinquishing sole ownership of prophecy. Voice and motivation remain specific to the turner throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—fixing vs. remembering—are embodied in the pillbox and gear; the final choice to “go west, together” is earned by the tactile repair scene and carries visible relational cost. Elias’s mirrored burns and engineer’s gaze give him credible interiority in silence. Minor slip: “unused courage waits where we decide to carry it” edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his needle-compass, the silver hair he sacrifices—but the woman’s arrival and her folio feel slightly external; her motivation is stated rather than dramatized, keeping the relationship from becoming a crucible. The final realization that his own questions are braided into the river is earned and costly, yet the woman’s agency remains under-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rua’s interior motive—“to understand why some places resist change”—drives every micro-choice, yet the story leans heavily on poetic affirmation rather than embodied tension, allowing contradictory impulses to remain largely poetic and never dramatized under bodily threat. The final “kiln of moments” is earned, but it feels more revelation than costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “wistfully pragmatic” stance shows in every micro-choice (wedging seashell shards, guiding Nara’s hands). The contradiction between caretaker tenderness and pragmatic risk-taking drives the final decision to bring Nara below. Cost is felt: the prism now demands a living steward, foreclosing Milo’s solitary freedom. Only a slight over-articulation of “protected vulnerability” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet choosing solitary migration—is embodied in the tactile hum threading her wrists and the final slide of starlight. The reincarnation memory supplies motive without overt exposition, and her micro-choice to tip the sundial costs her the safety of the floating library. Flaw: the glyptodon poets remain off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—keeper vs releaser of secrets—drives every beat; the paper-boat surrender is earned by prior guilt and yields visible lightness. Embodied emotion (“breathed outside her ribs”) is specific, not therapeutic. Secondary pressure from Arun is minimal but sufficient for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mina’s interiority is vivid—her “practiced delicacy” with headphones, the “ozone and coffee” breath—yet the moment she reroutes the transmitter her contradictory hope/resolve crystallizes with visible cost (Calvin neutralized, auroras celebratory). The only gap: Calvin’s opportunism is sketched more by label than by embodied pressure, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aveline’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in every move—measuring exits, reciting primes, tracing circles with the compass—so her final choice to pocket the key carries earned cost. The internal contradiction (fear vs duty) stays active in scene, not summarized. Minor slip: “wistful rebellion” is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Samara’s interiority is concrete—her inability to recognize faces collides head-on with her hyper-precise sketch memory, creating pressure in every beat. Methodical numbering acts as embodied flaw, not label, and it drives her final tactic: counting beats to break both suspects. The cost is legible on the page: she exchanges face-blind safety for a new, vertiginous empathy she “cannot see but feels bloom in the air”.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marla’s contradictory impulses—librarian’s caution vs. ancestral obsession—are embodied in micro-choices (midnight disinterment, copper nail tap, final exchange). The cost of her renunciation is legible in Havel’s trembling hand and the vanished footprints. Minor slip: “nervously confident” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avery’s choices—pocketing the flake, stepping past the guardrail, playing the bridge—track with the “dynamically observant” trait and escalate. Interiority is embodied (light fracture noticing) rather than labeled, and the final renunciation (turning the lens toward others) is earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eliot’s “quiet eyes” and “polished calm” are embodied through the deliberate ritual of laying out bills; the micro-choice of leaving kyat and krona behind crystallizes his arc. Mira’s exhaustion and soft voice under pressure feel lived-in, and their shared decision to “walk listening” carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; more friction would push this higher. Relationship shift is subtle yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (grief vs duty, solitude vs outreach) act simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to broadcast the warning crystallizes her arc and carries visible cost—she relinquishes private mourning for communal risk. Mentor backstory is anchored to present action via the telegram cue and alters her tactics. Only a slight over-articulation of “heal with words” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Inyara’s interior contradictions—guilt for abandoning her sister versus duty to trees—drive every choice. Micro-choice of tracing circles in ice while naming lost truths embodies that tension. Cost crystallizes when past abandonment is relinquished to lake memory, earning her straightened bow. Character earns the closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s interiority is vivid—scars as “ports,” sap tracing “constellations”—and his spiral self-wounding is a credible, embodied cost. Motive (“renegotiate dreams”) is stated abstractly but dramatized through the blood-sap exchange. The final step along the newborn path crystallizes a stance with felt consequence. One notch below 9.0 because the covenant backstory is delivered in summary rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—reckless drive vs. fiercely gentle mercy—are embodied in every micro-choice; the orchard bargain crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost. The burned tarot and second seed anchor interior stakes without slipping into label-speak. Final renunciation is earned and forecloses her own future.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gideon’s contradictory impulses—fact-armoring vs. raw grief—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the cloth, reciting specs). The final resolve to restore the tapes is earned by the notebook’s causal trigger and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “confidently uncertain” is asserted more than dramatized until late.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aram’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—tapping nodes, translating aloud to a tree—while contradictory grief and scientific hunger coexist in real time. The final renunciation (planting the seed elsewhere) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the sister’s absence becomes a portable echo rather than a retrievable presence. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “haunted ambitions” is slightly label-like, though immediately embodied by the coffin memory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silence’s interiority is vivid—her moon-phase pulse and shifting identity are embodied, not labeled—but the final renunciation (“tended it like flame”) feels slightly under-motivated; we see her ritual but not the immediate cost to her own migrating self.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Roan’s interior contradiction—inspecting shelters while fearing to live—drives every beat; the embodied shame when he confesses “I inspect shelters because I fear living” crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Micro-choices (kneeling, cradling the shell, tracing words on pearl) reveal hierarchy of values. Only minor slip: the fiancée flashback is summary rather than embodied memory.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the chronicler’s “daringly methodical” indexing and later micro-choice to kneel and pry the hatch show motive in action. The final renunciation—writing the lighter notebook—earns its cost through prior guilt and shared labor. Minor slip: Mara’s backstory is delivered in compressed exposition rather than dramatized pressure, slightly blunting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart trembling with cautious exuberance”), but the final renunciation—surrendering the watch—feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (loss of the timepiece) yet the emotional ledger isn’t fully dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s plant-telepathy is embodied in every beat—she hears roses, negotiates with ivy, and her final renunciation is rooted in that gift. The mulberry ache is viscerally tracked through pulse and breath, and her choice to leave the violin with the moss carries a felt cost. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; the ache never fully collides with a counter-desire. Still, the character reads as singular and the closure choice is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysandra’s contradictory impulses—reverence for the dead vs hunger to wrest beauty from oblivion—are embodied in micro-choices (tuning the radio, balancing on the “ledge of stillness”). The final renunciation—promising to return the spark—costs her future risk and is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Simeon’s interior contradiction—caretaker identity versus unresolved hollow of forgiveness—is embodied in concrete micro-moves (hands on moss, sandals brushing limestone, placing the hairpin into pooled water). The decision to dissolve the hairpin reweights his arc with felt loss; renunciation of the symbol forecloses return to his earlier caretaker stance, cost fully legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conscience-for-hire feels fully embodied through action, showing an earned public persona that masks calculation. His dialogue advances plot and theme while his sincerely-insincere register shapes the protagonist's choices: he doesn’t preach but hands over doubt and demands payment only with the pilgrimage’s conclusion. The micro-turn—accepting the cloak instead of coin—locks the internal reconfiguration. One sharp detail: when he laughs and drapes the cloak without offense, his shrug becomes the story’s hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s reverse-aging paradox is embodied in posture and gaze; Rowan’s hunger is shown through pacing and chalk-line refusal. Their power dynamic shifts via micro-choice (stepping the circle) with visible cost—Rowan’s erasure and Mira’s withheld recall. Interior contradiction (Mira’s memory of once being the old teacher) is cleanly anchored in present silence. Only the chalk glow and faint warmth keep it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ithar’s interiority is embodied and specific—tasting flint, aligning heartbeat with stone—yet the contradiction between seeking power and renouncing rule is only asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (etching the arrowhead for others) is foreshadowed but lacks a felt cost on the page; it reads as generous rather than sacrificial. Still, the character’s perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, and micro-choices under pressure (planting the arrowhead, humming the dead) reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Felius’s interior contradiction—yearning for brilliance while embracing mediocrity—drives every beat; the keystone choice, mist descent, and final warming all spring from this tension. Embodied emotion (“brilliant dimness,” “breathing into cold palms”) is specific and non-generic. The earned stasis—carrying a pocket-sun back to “lower worlds”—forecloses the old life with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emil’s interior contradiction—yearning for chromatic truth while hiding his own vow—drives every micro-choice; the final spoken vow costs him anonymity and is earned by the gray-footstep epiphany. Embodied emotion (“heart hammering with colorless static”) grounds the arc without therapy-speak. The childhood lullaby remains off-stage, so the mother is not a second on-page character; no relationship crucible applies. Flaw and desire interlock cleanly, satisfying the 9+ quick test except for the slight safety of the crowd’s wordless approval.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ikram’s interiority is vivid—his fear of misleading the colony collides with the prophecy’s pull, embodied in the tremor up his arm from the Cydonia coin. The final choice to “go where echoes begin” is earned by the coin-casting ritual and carries visible communal cost. Reflection stays anchored to present micro-choices (counting photons, spinning the coin). Only the childhood memory drifts slightly past the 20 % allowance, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Protagonist's layered fear and need are embodied in every micro-choice; the reaper’s millennia grief is rendered as “lunar dust” and a chest cavity that houses the atlas—concrete, costly. The climactic decision to name the un-nameable is earned by prior terror and agency.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orin’s brittle devotion is embodied in trembling palms and whispered apologies; the interior contradiction between naive hope and cosmic fear drives every micro-choice. The final offering of sweat crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: “lukewarm” is asserted more than dramatized until the bell’s levitation forces the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “precisely humane pull” and “water can carry memory” belief ground every micro-choice. The pocketing of the label, the lowering of the sluice, and the pinning of the photo all enact her value hierarchy under pressure. The final stance—renouncing official history at personal risk—earns its cost through prior beats. One hairline slip: the phrase “collective silence yields to stories” edges toward summary rather than embodied shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sera’s contradictory impulses—yearning for transcendence yet clinging to mortal tenderness—are dramatized in the orchard climb and crystal choice; the embodied cost (pulse-tempered flame under collarbone) is visible and earned. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. Only the “secretly sentimental” label is slightly external, but the pressed violets under beakers rescue it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—muscle memory of the buckle, bark biting gloves—yet the final choice to reroute the convoy feels slightly under-motivated; Command’s hesitation is voiced but not fully internalized as a personal cost, so the renunciation lands as competent rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (to reclaim feeling yet fear it) are embodied in the breathing sync and tear-seeds; the final integration is earned by prior causality. The clones act as externalized facets rather than independent agents, so relationship pressure is minimal. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of therapy-speak (“emotional numbness had been defeated”) nicks the score.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren’s curiosity and risk-embrace are embodied in tactile choices—cracking the seal, adjusting the terrarium vent—yet her interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“innovation did need hush”) rather than contradictory impulse. The final whispered gratitude shows earned stance but lacks visible cost; the seed’s glow is more wonder than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Orren Finch’s mourning-and-yearning duality fuels every creative decision he makes on the page; from the first engine-cough to the last bow, his interior conflict (“What if laughter kills me when it returns?”) is enacted physically and sonically. Flaws drive inevitable mistakes (pouring gasoline into grief, pushing machines too loud) that compound until he achieves an earned, costly reconfiguration: regenerated laughter that does not erase loss, only bears it differently.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The feline POV feels lived-in—"steering my paws outdoors," "breathed the chill into my lungs"—but interiority flirts with excess lyricism. Micro-choice to internalize the garden’s cold is embodied, yet the homesickness label abstracts rather than burdens. Guardian role is more posture than vocation; stakes lack feral bite. Still, the final pocketing of the pendant shows earned presence, cost foreclosed in “enough certainty.”

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Everard’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in the ritual’s micro-choices—balancing the tear, peeling away shame—so the final thaw feels earned. The interior contradiction (absorbing pain while outwardly unmoved) is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is visible: the mask of hopelessness is surrendered, foreclosing retreat. Minor slip: “stoically sensitive” is stated once rather than shown through earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “serenely electric” scarf, the “corroded dial” beneath her glove—but the mentor’s aphorisms feel slightly expository rather than lived. The final choice to dismantle her receiver and sacrifice the fragment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but muted; the emotional layering is strong yet not fully contradictory. Overall, a compelling, character-driven arc with minor expository drift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo’s interiority is lyrical and consistent; his childhood motive surfaces late but is anchored to the hourglass beat, earning the final stance. Embodied emotion (“tears and laughter rippled across the deck”) shows contradictory impulses. The cost—accepting impermanence as arrival—feels scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s desire to “discover the texture of connection” is clear and embodied in every beat; her climactic act of cutting her own keystone thread is a credible renunciation that costs her the memory of learning speech. Interiority is vivid (“unsettling calm pooled around her boots”) and micro-choices (climbing the ladder, cutting the thread) reveal hierarchy of values. Flawed competence balanced with genuine risk. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s penance-mission is vivid, but the students remain types; only Tarek is named and he acts once. Interior contradiction is implied (“solemn as the abyss yet pointing outward”) yet never dramatized in-scene; the final certainty feels bestowed rather than earned through visible flaw-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s curiosity is embodied in every micro-choice (adjusting the aid, following pulses, sealing the jar) and drives the arc; the final renunciation—leaving the voices playing for ghosts—carries visible cost (her lantern drained, her solitude) and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira's panic, vocation, and devotion are braided into every beat; her choice to restart the phase-gate is hard-earned, foreclosing the escape route with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to anonymity yet craving coherence—are embodied in micro-choices (counting heartbeats, placing the shard, surrendering the tape). The final renunciation of the memory is earned and costly, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction rather than raw contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ioreth’s copper-veined skin and tactile gift are embodied in every micro-choice; the purchase of the diamond, the diamond’s placement, and the recitation of textures all spring from a consistent drive to “translate texture into sound.” Interior contradiction surfaces when he risks madness yet calls it “music misheard,” a tension that culminates in the Earned Stasis of sealing the passage with his own body as archive. The cost—carrying a dying language inside him—lands on the page in the final rustle of pages.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s interior contradiction—grief vs. scientific detachment—drives every micro-choice; the moment he seeds his resentments into the phone, motive crystallizes with visible cost. Juniper’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters the final stance. Only the brother’s reappearance feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elaine’s interiority is embodied through tactile violin work and pulse-listening; her contradictory fear and resolve surface in the moment she flings the locust shell. Lio’s presence is thin but sufficient to create relational pressure. The final stance—beauty decided, not displayed—carries earned cost. Minor: we never feel Lio’s flaws complicate his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lorin’s contradictory impulses—respectful bowing yet rebellious route choices—are dramatized in micro-moves (foil cloak, off-path detour). The storm bottle externalizes his quest to heal broken promises, and the final uncorking is earned by childhood absences rendered in concrete detail. Interiority stays embodied; no label-speak. Cost is felt as the air “lightens” and the hush reforms.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlo’s vow to “interpret silence as possibility” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tapping cedar, pocketing the shard, tuning copper pipe—each action aligning motive with escalating stakes. Interiority is specific, never abstract: the shard “says story,” the restored halo “hums with the same quietly persistent pitch as his heart.” The final renunciation—letting music speak for him—earns its cost by foreclosing any return to wordless isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hollis’s eccentricity is embodied in tactile rituals (scarf, chalk) and a coherent interior contradiction—he seeks stories yet renounces seizure. The final bow to “shelve silence” crystallizes a cost: he forfeits immediate possession for stewardship, earning the quiet that invites creation. Micro-choices (draping scarf, drawing disk, stepping back) reveal a hierarchy valuing custodianship over conquest. Interiority stays specific, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Callix’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulse to shelve versus liberate the dream is dramatized in the moment he lowers the brush and lifts the camera. The final renunciation—choosing stewardship over ownership—carries visible cost as the palette’s “smell of conclusion” is rejected. Micro-choices (angling the palette, freezing the sun) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. No relationship crucible on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orin’s quiet courage is embodied in the breath that opens the clasps, but interiority drifts toward lyric abstraction rather than contradictory impulse; the woman’s fear is only inferred, never dramatized on the page, so the cost feels diffuse rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile curiosity and fear of forgetting collide in the bare-handed mushroom touch. The memory erosion flaw is embodied, not labeled, and the final reciprocation with the fungus carries visible cost (she gives up fresh memories). One more contradictory impulse mid-scene would have nudged this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shard-mirror archivist is a lucid, contradictory consciousness: “walks backwards when nervous” instantly embodies flaw while active micro-choice (stepping backward toward darkest stacks to outmanoeuvre Harl) shows that motive governs tactics; exile-stakes drive each backward retreat until the final retention—“I stayed” is an earned renunciation whose cost is the refusal of freedom—yet a smear of diagnostic label (“tutoring in endurance”) and late-appearing Inspector flatten secondary dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orien’s interiority is vivid—his “luster of seasons counted in rings” and tactile reverence for pruning anchor motive. The lifelong vow with Liora crystallizes a credible renunciation of fame, paying cost in anonymity. Yet the shared POV dilutes internal contradiction; we see more joint purpose than clashing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Neris’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of mask shards and the net anchors her contradictory impulses. The final bow and heartbeat-applause crystallize her renunciation with visible cost. Minor drift: the actor-spirit’s hunger is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Levin’s guarded curiosity and embodied hesitation (“hesitant footfall,” “shiver”) anchor interiority; the final vow to “ask before it names” crystallizes earned change. Yet the mentor’s cryptic note remains slightly abstract, blunting the cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between analytic detachment and raw grief is dramatized through micro-choices (severing the wire, cradling the globe). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “physics of letting go” edges toward label-speak, though it is quickly re-embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The balladeer’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet remains anchored in concrete micro-choices (spray-paint strokes, bolt-plate pivot, final bow). Motive—articulate unspoken needs—drives every beat, and the closing renunciation (walking away, leaving the wall humming) carries visible cost: he forfeits ownership of the encoded song. The “driftingly alert” stance is embodied rather than labeled, shaping perception and action. Minor: no secondary on-page character to test status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the servant’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. loyalty—play out in real time around the diary. The final whispered line lands as a credible micro-choice that alters the power balance and carries social risk. Minor: the “mathematical indifference” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her contradictory impulses (scientist vs. mystic) play out in real time as she labels clouds, cuts ballast, and finally steps into air. The final renunciation is earned: her belief that memory must be released, not possessed, costs her life and the data itself. One slip: “trembling certainty” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s face-blind portraitist premise is vivid, specific, and motive-deep (“mirror the sky inside walls”); contradictory impulses (“felt vs. looked” desire vs. doubt) live on-stage. Micro-choices (blindfold, pigment by temperature) escalate internally. Final renunciation (never seeing faces yet completing the sky) costs her the familiar recognition everyone else takes for granted; this is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aleksei's motivation (chart the new discovery) crystallizes via tangible micro-choices—kneeling at the hopscotch, chalking numbers, noting the light-bird rhythm—while his flaw (restlessness) sustains cost: he sleeps on deck and wakes smeared with evidence ("charcoal smears streaking his cheeks like war paint"). Interiority stays embodied ("trembling solitude") and the final renunciation of normal charts arrives with earned stasis as the isle renames the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selene’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory longing for repair versus fear of failure drives every micro-choice. The apology to her mirrored self crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Serafin’s altruism is dramatized through chalked tactics and sleepless vigil, but the narrator’s interiority drifts toward summary (“I feared…”) rather than embodied contradiction at the crucial second bell-ring; still, the earned hush and fused stone show a visible cost that forecloses isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, bruised awe, heartbeat offered as metronome—yet the “lullaby” motive remains slightly abstract until the final sacrifice. The porcelain head functions as memory-jar and catalyst, grounding her contradictory impulses. The renunciation of her own pulse is earned and costly, though the mentor’s warning feels more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied through micro-choices—pocketing the nut, pruning rot, guiding miners—each action revealing layered motives. Internal contradiction surfaces when her “hidden vow” clashes with her claim of not being a hero, culminating in the Earned Stasis of silent return. The cost—exhaustion, secrecy, and the orchard’s unspoken debt—is visible and scaled to the word count. Minor slip: the miners’ gratitude feels generic, blurring status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; Talitha’s guilt and scientific lens feel specific. The final choice—sending the polymer swans—earns its cost through prior beats. The absence of Mara on-page limits relationship-as-crucible pressure, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kes’s interiority is vivid—his “mindfully scattered” plan and the bottled moonlight inheritance anchor motive. The final renunciation (leaving the slate blank) is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost: he forfeits profit and the orchard’s coordinates dissolve. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kilor’s contradictory motives (obligation vs self-erasure) manifest through tactile embodiment—salt on his boots, stumbles at first contact, hand offered to coral gate. Sel’s remorse travels skin-to-skin, forcing an active choice keep or release. Final renunciation feels earned: Kilor volunteers as living buffer, visible cost when doors seal and his humming replaces armor-clang. No slip touches closure; flaws intensify choice instead of resolving tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lysandra is vivid—her vocation informs every beat, her motives tethered to the literal work of tuning buildings. The interior contradiction (empathy vs. cost of theft) is dramatized in the theft decision, not merely stated. Emotional cost is embodied as physical fatigue leaning against warm timber; no stock labels or diagnostic talk. Relationship with the elevator is treated as a living duet, fulfilling the crucible test.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhea’s contradictory impulses—fear vs curiosity—are embodied in her uneven breath and trembling ribs; the vow to catalog rather than plunder crystallizes her custodial stance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and helix-specific, but the final shift to “witness” feels slightly abstract, blunting the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quillon’s prism-minded cataloguing and embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., “numbers became colors, colors became directions”) are vivid and consistent; the final renunciation—vowing to guard the knowledge—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is hinted but not fully dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lark’s interiority is embodied and specific—his breathing mirrors the grove’s silence, his charcoal fingers read stone pulses. The final renunciation of speech after the performance is earned by the prior empathic labor and carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tomas’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. grace—plays out in the queen-sacrifice moment; the worry stone’s smoothing registers embodied cost. Motivation (beauty in difficulty) drives every micro-choice; exile is not just backstory but active pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the nexus) forecloses return with quiet but visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s interiority—catalog of silences as emotional labor—charges every micro-choice; his pacifism translates to inventive non-violent action, showing embodied contradiction when grief must be literally tuned. The emotional stake in restoring Oriel’s research (and relationship) is dramatized through the diary clasp itself, but reflection occasionally waxes self-aware, not quite cost-baring. Still, the final image of “Heart Conceding Applause” crystallizes earned stasis with visible regret and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora's olfactory gift is embodied, not labeled (“resinous stories she could nearly read with her nose”), yet her contradiction—ambition vs. reverence—feels slightly muted until the elders’ challenge; her decision to descend and breathe “with expectation exhaling” crystallizes motive, but internal struggle could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ryn’s oath, interior contradiction (guild duty vs hunger quest), and embodied micro-choices (clipping spear to harness, rolling the glider) all track cleanly; the final renunciation—accepting stewardship of circulating memory—carries visible cost as the arches dim and silence returns. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “heart echoing.”

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her contradictory impulse to “cultivate foresight in action” vs. the need to scramble the wind is embodied in the final act of broadcasting randomized gusts. The cost—leaving the second patch as warning and sealing the star-shaped cavity—lands on the page. No stock phrasing; her perceptual signature is consistent. Minor: the mentor line is a brief reflective fragment within BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harmona’s interiority is vivid and embodied—synesthetic tasting of winter honey, violet spirals—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. calm) are stated rather than dramatized in real time. The final choice to ring all three bells is foreshadowed but the cost feels abstract; the “peppered silver” in her lungs is the only embodied price. Still, her vocation and flaw (oscillating repose) remain coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is precise and specific to Kalen’s longing and regret; the embodied tension when he first plays the flute crystallizes his contradictory impulses. Motivation root-to-ending linkage is clean, and his final modulation feels earned by accumulated beat-to-beat pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dreya’s interiority is vivid—her borrowed personalities bruise ribs and pulse like chalk—but the final renunciation (“loved its motion”) feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is legible yet not fully embodied in a last micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tren’s jittery metronome boots and palm-to-satchel tic embody the courier’s anxious vocation; the mentor-shaped absence drives every micro-choice (drumming the triplet rhythm, risking the pendant’s lure). The final renunciation—letting the relic root itself—earns its cost through prior fear of betrayal, crystallizing an internal arc without tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her shiver at borrowed guilt, toes gripping quartz cracks—but the final “ready to translate” moment feels slightly abstract, blunting the cost of what she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ira’s interior contradiction—yearning to send the laugh yet knowing the toll—drives every shuttle pass; her embodied aging under the loom is specific and costly. The final renunciation is earned: “the loom spinner expired like a candle finishing its letter” forecloses her path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ellan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the memory-for-silk trade and the final vow to guard others’ forgettings crystallize his arc with felt cost. The “quietly determined spark” is dramatized through deliberate micro-choices rather than labels. Minor slip: the phrase “meekness had been muscle all along” edges toward tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the cyclical spontaneity trait is dramatized through synesthetic tunnel-weaving and the final renunciation. The withheld-truth motive drives every beat, and the sister’s hologram crystallizes the cost of exile. Micro-choices (pressing shard, redirecting strands, pocketing it) reveal a hierarchy of values. The only slip is a brief explanatory lull in the hologram speech that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ellis’s reticence is embodied in gesture and silence; the contradictory impulse to speak yet hold back peaks when he names the shard “Anchor,” a micro-choice that seals his role as guardian. Interiority is specific and salt-stained, never generic. The final hush he carries away is earned by prior causal chain—protecting the tower costs him the comfort of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mora’s hunger to shape dawn is embodied in salt-taste and wrist-bone instinct; the final rotation of the wick is a micro-choice that costs her perpetual stewardship. Herald’s laughter skips octaves, but his agency is off-stage, so relationship crucible is thin. Interiority is vivid, yet the herald’s vanishing leaves a motivational vacuum that nicks the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora's contradictory impulse—craving stories yet fearing they might "bind"—is embodied in her handling of the donor heart: "the borrowed organ drummed a tempo both alien and thrilling." Her final choice, painting a dye that remembers without capturing, is foreshadowed by every micro-choice (accepting the wing, ascending the stairs, tracking sun). Yet the interior stakes ("why some people magnetize stories") remain partially abstract; we register yearning more than the precise wound. Still, Earned Stasis is legible when she smiles at the renamed self-canvas—a concrete cost paid in permanent uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eron’s promise to the dead astronomer and his ankle-ache anchor interior stakes; the contradictory pull between duty and wonder is embodied in every step. Micro-choice—offering the sextant to the cedar—earns the earned stasis of setting the mop aside. Yet the trees remain archetypal observers rather than relational crucibles, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the keeper’s contradictory impulse—obedience vs. refusal to imprison memories—drives every beat. The final renunciation (tearing the logbook) is foreshadowed by earlier micro-choices and carries visible cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lowell’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet hiding—drives every beat; the ledger choice crystallizes his arc with visible cost (renouncing perpetual retreat). Empathy is embodied (ear to shutter, tears on mirrored page) rather than labeled. Only the attendant’s minimal presence keeps relationship pressure off-stage, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between cataloguing loss and planting renewal is dramatized in the seed-planting micro-choices. The final renunciation—leaving applause behind—earns its cost through prior guilt and the bread-sharing ritual. Minor slip: “absolution is always tenuous” edges toward label-speak, though it is immediately grounded in Madam Ko’s root metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quillan’s meticulous nature is embodied in every micro-choice—counting, tuning, sealing—yet the interior contradiction (order vs. the unmeasured vow) is dramatized only in the final beats; earlier reflection is summary. The cost of retrieving the vow is felt, but the sister’s absence is more asserted than lived, capping emotional depth just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s interiority is embodied and stakes-driven; the watch-fob taps against her sternum as a felt metronome of narrowing time. Her contradictory impulses—loyalty to her father versus self-preservation—surface in the hush-breaking moment when she chooses to seal the crack of trust in memory rather than cylinder. The final vow to keep the fob shut carries visible cost: she forecloses the easy replay of that sound. Minor slip: Cinder’s grudging loyalty is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zephra’s phosphorescent skepticism and Lior’s itinerant rain are vivid, but the interior contradiction between logic and companionship is only asserted, not dramatized in a single charged beat; the final “evolution” of skepticism feels summary rather than earned by a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—perfect recall vs. the need to forget—drives every beat; the deliberate erasure of memory is embodied in the crystal absorption and costs her the safety of the known. The final laugh that does not return seals the earned stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cressida's compulsion toward honesty—dramatized by wilting near falsehood—grounds every moment-to-moment choice and physically alters her body state; her final gesture planting seeds is earned by this trait rather than imposed. Interiority shows simultaneous hope and bodily dread without therapy-speak. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy when she trades safety for truthful utterance. One flaw: Fen is less individuated, shifting some relationship crucible into instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his ribs as a “cage,” the throat “stitched with unseen thread.” The mute season and the need to “listen until the sculpture told him” create a credible, character-bound constraint that drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—etching silent instructions—earns its cost because the prior beats have dramatized both his dependence on silence and the fragility of wonder. Only the council scene feels slightly external; their worry is sketched rather than pressed into Arlen’s skin.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“coral patterns creep…heartbeat moss”), but the android’s contradictory impulses remain largely stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the emotional layering could be sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marisol’s interiority is specific and embodied; her “quiet smile” and deliberate listening posture reveal contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. caretaking. Mr. Cardoza’s trembling confession and ankle-key gesture show earned cost. The padlock-as-shame motif complicates both characters without tidy resolution. Minor slip: Esmeralda remains off-page, so relationship crucible pressure is filtered rather than direct.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—loyalty to former masters vs revenge—remains embodied in micro-choices (dancing to open vault yet also teaching it mercy), culminating in a renunciation foreclosing her past with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kerrin’s interiority is vivid—her folding tinder into the apron pocket, the brittle flowers, the merging infant—yet the “gleaming silence” refrain edges toward performed mood. The final choice to exhume her own core is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of fogged obedience), satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: the harbor’s “wants” anthropomorphize without complicating her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The summoner’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the act of “pinching the air above the stone” crystallizes motive and cost. Contradictory impulses—duty to silence vs. temptation to speak—coexist in scene. The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost: he becomes “the quiet cartographer of peace,” a stance that forecloses future speech.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s obsession with masonry-language is embodied through concrete micro-choices (renting the attic, pressing the seal into rainwater). Selin’s translucent flicker and Mrs. Polina’s tearful confession give on-page cost to their shared guilt. The final promise to carry the lessons elsewhere is earned by prior intimacy and betrayal. Interiority remains specific, though the late murder revelation feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses (archive vs consume, self-protect vs embrace loss) push every beat; her embodied skepticism, yearning, and grief collide in the final choice to carry the brother’s shell onward. The internal conflict scales with pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iriel’s contradictory impulses—rebellion vs. forgiveness—are embodied in the micro-choice of pressing the thorn into his own thumb, sealing both edict and absolution. The cost is visible: memory toll, blood, and the automaton’s reprogramming. Interiority is specific, never drifting into label-speak. Only the mentor’s absence keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silva’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her dread of communal voice and the final acceptance of the pact carry visible cost. The contradiction between her need to preserve self and her vocation as mediator is dramatized in the chamber scene. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the decisive choice. Only the merchant’s twin feels slightly off-stage, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to reveal vs preserve the monks’ myth) surface in the trance and in her final speech. The cost—publicly shattering the glacier’s halo—is dramatized and paid. Minor slip: the monks remain collective silhouettes rather than individuals, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hai-rin’s interiority is specific—water lattices, moon bridges, net metaphors—yet the final choice to gather the net without drinking the tea crystallizes his value hierarchy with felt cost. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. modesty) play out in micro-gestures. Secondary pressure from Zhen is light but present. The earned renunciation (not drinking) is small yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s skeptical drive and embodied observation anchor every beat; her final renunciation to secrecy is earned by the orchard’s living proof and the children she passed. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is that Hollis remains a cipher—no status tension exploited—so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orrin's interior motive ("shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is anchored in specific choice: tuning dials, embedding coordinates. Yet Elara as a second character arrives so late the relationship crucible is truncated. The shift from "lonely" to "unlonely" is shown not labeled, but emotional embodiment edges toward abstraction in phrases like "turbines in his chest."

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Poet’s wistful interiority and embodied loneliness anchor his choices; the decision to release the grandmother’s hum is earned by prior grief-work. Secondary characters remain functional, not crucible-level, but the family’s micro-reactions under pressure read true. No unmotivated epiphanies; cost is felt in the poet’s renewed solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s fierce protectiveness and Callix’s sonic absolution define choices under pressure; both bear embodied cost when Callix collapses and Mara steadies him with her “rare thaw,” making their motives credible. Interiority is specific—“she felt the coastline breathe easier”—yet the closing dialogue about belief vs evidence flirts with tidy articulation. Status dynamics shift subtly as engineer and acoustician swap authority, each paying in exhaustion. Their renunciation is earned—leaving the relic undisturbed—though secondary raiders remain one-note instruments rather than nuanced stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapper’s restrained wildness and softly purposeful cadence are embodied in every micro-choice; the narrator’s shift from urgency to stillness is earned through concrete alignment work and a visible cost—the surrender of his impatience. Interior contradiction is palpable yet never slips into label-speak. The relationship functions as crucible: her pressure reshapes his stance, and the final salute seals the change.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s drive is coherent—her escape from Director Havel is both emotional and professional—and her interiority is precise (“record…forged signature”). Yet her single on-page beat with the worker lacks contradiction or interior friction; gratitude feels too neat for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maeve’s deliberate craftswoman trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tweezers, soldering, final key-turn) that carry visible cost; her interior contradiction—hope vs. doubt about the tune’s real value—drives the climax. Arden’s motivation is clear but less textured; his tears feel earned yet generic. The balance-wheel names etch intimacy without slipping into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s irreverent awe and steady curiosity are embodied in every micro-choice—bargaining with acid, whispering jokes, yanking the release cord—so motive stays legible and intensifies. The final laugh that “cuts the night yet mends it” crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost: the bell now sings to things, not people, foreclosing ordinary recognition. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; a deeper clash could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s curiosity is embodied through tactile micro-choices—glowing gloves, threading the patch, rerouting cooling—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “sensed absence” labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation (broadcasting the breach) carries visible cost (legal teams storming in), earning the closure. Minor deduction for stock phrases like “brightly attentive gaze.”

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—“doubts curled like smoke inside conviction”—and her micro-choice to press the shards together crystallizes the bond. Silas’s pressure on her role as guardian sharpens her stance. The final smile carries earned cost: she accepts shared, not solo, heroism. Minor: Silas’s voice is slightly generic, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—gripping the parasol tip “like a metronome” and hearing “the edge of endings.” The shift from seeking death to accepting postponed departure is earned through her micro-choices aboard the trawler and the harmonica moment. The only cap is that the foreman remains functional rather than a crucible, keeping relationship pressure off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sentinel’s contradictions—guardian yet confessor, witness yet actor—are embodied in smoky coat and gentle nod; each micro-choice (offering apprenticeship, placing ash beside cane) reveals a hierarchy of values and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s embodied patience, tactile sand-reading, and final acceptance of wordlessness are vivid; her sole micro-choice (lifting the bowl) crystallizes a credible renunciation. However, the prophet’s vanishing and the absence of direct interaction keeps relationship cast at zero, and no status tension registers. Traits of honesty and balance imply lived contradiction, yet no overt mistake compounds, keeping internal arc slightly under risk.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her “eager metronome” heart against her “perceptively calm” face—but the contradiction never forces a micro-choice that costs her; she orchestrates rather than suffers. The townsfolk’s recognition arcs are moving yet external, so the earned change is communal, not personal. Still, her embodied attention to pattern and scent keeps her from abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orrin’s interiority is vivid—his “weathered innocence” and “reticent” stance are embodied in micro-choices (unwrapping the crystal only after the clock’s last tick). The contradiction between scholarly detachment and larcenous curiosity is dramatized, not labeled. The final bow to “patient breathing of futures” is an earned renunciation with visible cost: he accepts lifelong uncertainty. Minor slip: the tribunal’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s hunger to record aging is embodied in the faltering tape-recorder beats; the prophet’s precognitive amnesia drives every driftwood rearrangement. Interior contradictions—clinging to echoes while accepting forgetting—are dramatized, not labeled. The final stance of “open-eared surrender” costs the narrator the recorded melody, a credible renunciation. Minor: the prophet’s status shifts aren’t fully legible in dialogue, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eloi’s quiet technician interiority is well-sketched, culminating in the line “let it listen to the quiet it was seeking”—a resonant renunciation that costs him the heroic role he wanted. The one-line mention of his past “camera that insisted on photographing tomorrow” offers a sharp contradiction that charges the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm memory of the shard, her decisive kindness—but the estranged son Mateo remains a silhouette; his reconciliation is off-stage, so relationship pressure is inferred rather than dramatized. Hector’s motivation is clear and intensifies to the final request, yet the cost is felt more by Mateo than by Mara, slightly diluting her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orin’s quietly deliberate nature is dramatized through the blood-on-key micro-choice that outmaneuvers Vela; the interior contradiction between scholarly hunger and ethical refusal is embodied, not labeled. Vela’s pressure forces a visible cost—shared blood—that crystallizes their altered relationship. The final renunciation (document, not exploit) is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “quietly deliberate” is once asserted rather than shown in an early beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s skeptical forgiveness is embodied in micro-choices—nodding permission, cupping the jar, whispering a vow—each tightening the stake. Kedron’s “shrewdly innocent” paradox drives the bone-setting metaphor into literal narrative work. Interior contradictions (“cleft in certainty”) are dramatized, not labeled. Final renunciation of tidy answers carries visible cost: the garden dims, the cradle creaks, wonder is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interiority is embodied and specific (tear on glass, lighter heartbeat), but the absence of on-page opposition keeps her choices low-stakes; the renunciation is felt yet not truly tested by another will.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her quiet proactive stance drives every beat. The contradiction between her need for sanctuary and her invitation to Rowan is dramatized through micro-choices (typing coordinates, handing him the pendant). Rowan’s trembling hands and salt-tears are specific and earned. The final renunciation of isolation is paid for by the garden’s exposure tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Declan’s interiority is vivid—his stroking of the seashell embodies doubt, and the final mirror confrontation crystallizes his contradictory impulses. The cameos act as externalized facets of his psyche, but they remain symbolic rather than applying direct pressure, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the earned renunciation of despair lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orin’s interior contradiction—need to restore vs. fear of recurring neglect—is voiced only at the end and never tested mid-scene; the lack of embodied cost during live performance keeps this just below 9.0. Micro-choice to pocket a leaf signals renunciation, but the visible price waits off-page, weakening Earned Stasis clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arren’s embodied patience and micro-choices (counting breaths, aligning plate with orchard trunks, pressing sickle to sternum) create a credible interior arc; the final renunciation of counting is earned and carries felt cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Backstory fragments (burnt library) are brief and tilt present action. Minor slip: “flash-paper alchemist” label never activated on page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is rich and embodied—his “peripherally focused” stance and tactile listening to metal pulses feel lived-in. The contradiction between his vow to “store wonder” and the need to release it back to the village is dramatized through micro-choices (tilting the mirror, filing cogs). The final renunciation—tucking diagrams away for “later”—carries visible cost and earns closure. Minor slip: elder’s voice is generic, but Silas’s arc is self-sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Olivine’s interior contradictions crystallize when she must weigh her own burden against the braid she’s building; the moment “she reoriented the flame…toward her own shadow” externalizes that clash and forces the decisive, on-page cost: twelve drams of self-shortage added to the skein.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to “harvest lessons”—are embodied in micro-choices (touching the blank, flexing inner rhythm). Her decision to leave the sculpture forever unfinished is earned by the crystallized-time encounter and carries visible cost: she trades completion for ongoing companionship with absence. Interiority is specific, tactile, and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “reverence for circus tent poles,” which momentarily dilutes embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlo’s regret and scavenger identity are embodied in every beat—pocketing voices, trading memories for direction—culminating in the ghost’s cavity-filling choice that visibly costs him his hoarded stories. Interior contradiction (regret vs. need to move) stays active in scene. Minor slip: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than enacted until the lily-pad memory loss.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Milo’s curiosity, embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing pipes, pocketing the sextant, rotating planters), drives every beat; the internal contradiction between modesty and ambition surfaces in “did not claim victory.” The felt cost—blackened knuckles, letting the stars finish the work—earns the quiet renunciation. A second on-page character is absent, so relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to a dream while yearning for silence—drives every micro-choice; the memory of his mother counting thunder crystallizes the shift from measuring seconds to honoring intervals. The embodied cost (tears shared with the monastery) seals the renunciation. One slip: “excruciatingly gentle” drifts toward label-speak twice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is consistently character-driven; “private hunger” drives every beat. The sundial in pocket aligns motives to later action and flaw. No clunky self-analysis—only embodied cost at Lock Nine.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sera’s patience and seed-collector identity are embodied in tactile choices—tracing knots, trading seeds, cradling fulgurite—yet interior contradiction is muted; the “promise to sow when the world is ready” is more emblematic than agonizing. Secondary pressure from the fisherman is slight but sufficient to trigger the quest. Cost is felt in the pledge that “tiny roots gripped my ribs,” an earned stasis rather than change.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Holt’s persona is vivid—obituary writer for the living—but limited micro-choices; his real action is listening and deciding to map healing, creating one key causal beat. Interior contradiction is mostly rhetorical, not embodied, and the final renunciation feels narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oriven’s contradictory impulses—yearning for beauty yet fearing caprice—are embodied in trembling hands and sideways crown; his micro-choice to place the egg in the gyroscope crystallizes stakes. The final descent with bird in arms shows earned cost: palace anchors crack, beauty may yet fall. Interiority stays concrete, though a few phrases (“bitterly sweet defiance”) edge toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maia’s interiority is textured—burn scar, sand pocketing, coin against blister—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values. The paradox of daughter-firefighter is embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation (“I will not despise the spark”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: tears as dew, smoke lifting. Only minor slip: “graft” bell feels slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurin’s skepticism and memory-liberation motive are consistent, embodied in micro-choices (pouring rain through the shard, ringing the bell). Interiority is specific, though the final beat of “doubt blinking off” is slightly abstract. Cost is visible: the geese leave, winter still threatens, and the city’s silence is forever altered.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elinon’s interiority is vivid—her vow “to share light without using fire” threads every micro-choice, and the gear’s re-calibration is a concrete, embodied act that costs her certainty. The contradiction between soothing and freeing memory is dramatized in scene, not summarized. One slip: the phrase “troubling serenity” is repeated without deepening its charge, a minor label intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Len’s interiority is richly embodied (“fiercely meditative tide”), his micro-choices (tying ribbon, carving wing) align with motive, and the final renunciation (no name, porous stone) carries visible cost. Mira’s mentorship is more spectral device than character, so relationship crucible is thin, but Len’s contradiction—seeking collective shape yet refusing closure—earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—his metronomic gait, the pendulum’s weight, the rake handle’s dust-fine notches all externalize guilt. The incremental absolution arc is credible because each micro-confession is tied to a concrete past wrong and a present physical act. The final admission to Clara’s lie carries palpable cost, sealing the arc. Only the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s interiority is vivid—his midnight whistle, the hush “leaning forward,” the beetle-heart—yet the final choice (burying the case under Rowan’s hand) feels slightly under-motivated; we sense his empathy but not the precise internal pivot that makes this act inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Estra’s interiority is vivid—her pulse matching the gears, her whispered constraint—but the apprentice remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final smile and fresh ignorance map a credible endurance with cost. No stock phrasing, yet the “lazy jungles” line edges toward aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mila’s metronome-stubborn refusal of silence is embodied in tactile micro-choices (rosin-scented fingers on brick, humming A into the antenna). The interior contradiction—copyist turned smuggler of lyric fragments—drives every beat, and her final dispersal of dust stories costs her the pirate signal itself, an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s interiority is precise, embodied, and contradictory—his “somber marvel” at the mask’s power collides with the felt cost that his “heart will forget its wound.” The micro-choice to suspend the mask rather than wear it crystallizes his stance and forecloses safety. Liora’s remembered warning functions as a second pressure without slipping into exposition. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Corvin’s interior battle between skepticism and hope is embodied in concrete decisions—his agonizing over the cog and his ultimate climb—while the rare concession of a smile to Mara crystallizes the cost. Flaw: late revelation of earlier shared history is briefly stated rather than dramatized, a minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically sketched but remains abstract; her “expectantly resigned” stance is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. The choir members are sketched as types rather than individuals, so relationships never become a crucible. The final renunciation—leaving the city humming—earns resonance, yet the cost to Mara herself is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Moira’s contradictory impulses—refusing to consume the fruit alone yet risking its loss by communal pruning—are dramatized in the greenhouse beats; the final renunciation of personal omniscience for shared hope is earned and carries visible cost in her relinquishing the ladle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Protagonist’s interiority is concrete and embodied; the painful static on the lacquer box is a micro-choice that reveals risk tolerance. Bram’s involuntary candor creates immediate status pressure, forcing the protagonist to confess before entry. The final declaration is earned by prior stakes and carries visible cost (tower’s refusal risk). Minor: Bram’s emotional admission feels slightly expositional rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—why houses feel alive—drives each choice, and her internal contradiction (diagnosis vs compassion) is embodied when she realises the house is merely ‘mute’. Her bow is earned; the earlier hushed blaze and the orris-root warmth mark tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aios’s interior contradiction—guard vs. wonder—drives every beat; his telepathic outreach, kneel among the statues, and calibrated release of smoke are embodied choices that visibly cost him certainty and re-animate the others. Motivation remains coherent and intensifies to the final garden of questions. Minor: the chorus of revived statues is sketched more than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marlen’s contradictory impulses—statistical obsession vs. regret—are embodied in the chipped die and the chalk sums; the final renunciation (erasing the numbers) is earned by the dice roll that delivers the lost evening’s texture, costing him the perpetual-motion quest. Interiority is concrete (“tears were equations”), but a few stock phrases (“grim and oddly hopeful”) keep it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ravi’s insomnia, painter identity, and “methodically hopeful” trait are embodied in micro-choices—watering herbs, whispering apologies, brushing luminous letters. Interior contradiction (fear of the brush vs. need to act) is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Final renunciation—sleep among vines—earns its cost via prior exhaustion and the moon’s fading. One slip: “strangers remember kindness” is slightly abstract, but the embodied gestures compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iclea’s motive to “rescue dying arts” is embodied in the trembling removal of the cloth and the decisive order to bake; her interior contradiction—fear of ruin vs. hope in art—drives every beat. The apprentices remain functional chorus, so relationship crucible is N/A; her final whispered promise to hide the lens again shows earned cost and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sable’s hunger to escape fate is embodied in every micro-choice; the yoyo’s reverse winding literalizes her trait. Interiority stays concrete—her fingers “dart like minnows,” heartbeat “paces the inverse swing.” The final acceptance carries visible cost: the yoyo dissolves, the clocks freeze at the moment of first dream, liberty paid with loneliness. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s interiority sparkles when he pins the luminous photograph shards onto his coat—an embodied contradiction of armor and vulnerability—but the advisor remains an undifferentiated voice without interiority or stakes; as a result the cost of Eli’s final smile registers but their status shift feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—bones vibrating with “restless euphony” embodies motive—but the final renunciation (“trusted the sea to carry her compositions”) is slightly abstract; cost is felt yet diffuse, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corin’s grief-sharpened drive is embodied in every micro-choice; the cracked sextant and reed whistle act as tactile wounds. Interiority stays specific—dreams of the forbidden note, the burn of sunlight on scalp—without lapsing into label-speak. The final bow and acceptance of soul-hinge cracking earns the cost under Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—rational method vs savage need—drives every micro-choice; the caretaker’s grief-laden pivot feels earned because the ledger’s cost is already embodied in Mira’s trembling hands. One minor slip: “emotionally rational” is asserted more than dramatized until the final bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Callum’s contradictory impulses—stoic restraint vs. emotional excavation—are embodied in every micro-choice (kissing the wood, bowing to emptiness). The antique inkwell and dowelled notes externalize an interior conflict that tightens across beats. Closure shows earned renunciation: he leaves lighter, having paid with the burden he surrendered to the pavilion. The only flaw is a touch of abstract self-diagnosis (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) that slightly dilutes embodied motive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “fingers readjust a crooked volume” and she “counts texture as well as numerals.” The contradiction between her tranquil logic and the rising flood is dramatized, and her final stamp carries visible cost. Yet the absence of any second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s grief is embodied in every micro-choice—polishing gems, folding invisible paper, sealing the lantern with “braided sighs.” The contradiction between her wish to banish sorrow and her acceptance that it must stay is dramatized, not stated. The final moment of holding her brother’s voice “without bleeding” is earned by the prior causality of pain transformed into wings. Only the acolyte’s brief appearance prevents a higher score, as status dynamics are under-used.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ashraf’s contradictory impulses—hunger for answers vs. refusal to weaponize—are dramatized in the final surrender of the geode; the cost (extinguishing the last light of his bride) is embodied and felt. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The single on-page relationship (Sanaa) applies immediate pressure that alters his stance. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: the crystal > continent > memory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Nero’s perpetual surprise and childhood-lullaby ache give him an interior pulse, but the pilgrim remains a cipher; their shared breath-alignment is moving yet feels slightly unearned because her stakes are never embodied. The final “portable dusk” moment crystallizes his arc of renunciation, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt versus livelihood—drives every beat; the watch-hand’s pulse literalizes his embodied shame. His micro-choice to press it into the carving crystallizes the arc and costs him his former trade. Backstory is tightly anchored to present action and alters tactics. Flaw feels lived-in, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority—her tactile ritual with the drawer pull, her self-definition as “only the hinge”—is vivid and character-specific. The micro-choice to untether Ilren and hand him the pull crystallizes her value hierarchy and carries visible cost (Rouk’s hesitation, the risk to neutrality). Flaws and contradictions are present but not deeply probed under word count; the moment of earned compassion still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gideon’s interior contradiction—shame vs. the need to reach Marina—drives every beat; the compass tremor and ghost-vision crystallize cost. Embodied emotion (shaking hands, uneasy bark) grounds his arc. Final choice to “steer” while surrendering the compass earns renunciation with visible price. Minor: Marina’s off-stage forgiveness slightly softens relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tasting antiseptic and exile,” “bruised stars”), but the final empathy turn leans on therapeutic summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet slightly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s grief-driven motive is clear and embodied; the reluctant metamorphosis shows contradictory impulses (human vs avian) under pressure. The final half-beast compromise carries visible cost and reconfigures identity. Minor drift: “paradoxically steady” is asserted rather than dramatized in body.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to recover lost minutes yet surrendering cherished memories—are embodied in the firefly-like release of each recollection; the final hand-tracing with her father crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction rather than concrete contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Griffin’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between grief and nonviolence is dramatized through the nightly “Action” and the final self-forgiveness. The silhouettes function as pressure rather than characters, so relationship crucible is waived. The Earned Stasis—he forgives himself for surviving—pays the cost in buoyant weightlessness, foreclosing any return to the recycled ship.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Gideon’s contradictions—empty pockets yet purpose, financier turned seeker—are crystalline. His choice to tip the final jar of fireflies and accept the island’s choreography shows him remade from within; the cost is the surrender of the last wealth he owned. Ione exists primarily as catalyst; their minimal interaction still refracts his interior change. Interiority is embodied (“light warming nerves too long chilled”) and never diagnostic. One detail: “the last wealth he owned” is inferred—the fireflies could just be a tool—but the emotional arc earns this leap.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Serah’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. rebellion) act simultaneously in scene. The final smile folds the cost of complicity into a single charged image. Minor slip: “rumour insisted” is summary rather than dramatized trait.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aikan’s interior contradiction—visionary curse vs. grounded promise—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of frictionless drift carries visible cost when his feet regain weight. Interiority is embodied in drifting tear-spheres and brine-scented recall rather than labels. The only drag is a brief “promise loosened its claws” phrase that edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the poet’s contradictory impulses (rage vs. composure) play out in micro-choices—resetting the timer, stitching the map into his coat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orrin’s contradictory impulses—intellectual aggression vs. mechanical vulnerability—are dramatized in the elbow-overextension beat; Lys’s diplomatic ferocity is embodied in the bowstring simile and the final ceremonial offer. The joint renunciation of sole authorship is earned by their prior mirrored stances and costs them the safety of solitary certainty. Micro-choices (aligning the card with the sundial, exposing gears) reveal value hierarchies under pressure. No stock interiority; voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rook’s hunger to “forge beauty from anarchy” is embodied in every micro-choice—scattering seed-packets of words, stacking dictionaries under beams—yet the monthly molting trait is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping him just shy of full contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clarion’s longing is embodied in trembling fingers and pocketed clock; the contradictory wish to “upend time” versus the wound he carries is dramatized in the arbor scene and the final encore. Micro-choices—threading the reel, hiding the clock inside the piano—reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is felt when trains delay and fate is “startled,” yet the longing still warms rather than vanishes. One slip: “steely longing pooled behind his eyes” drifts toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The checker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—seed hums in pocket, ribs tremble—yet the “luminous doubt” never sharpens into contradictory action; choices are largely observational until the final carve-a-mast beat, which feels slightly under-cooked relative to the lyrical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Yun’s measured speech and pruning micro-choices embody his role, but Mara and Callix remain silhouettes; their interior contradictions are sketched rather than dramatized. The final renunciation—sealing memory-rings into bark—carries cost, yet the causal chain feels lightly sketched rather than pressured.
