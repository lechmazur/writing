  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation is embodied through concrete choices—requisitioning the greenhouse, building the device, writing code—and her internal shift from "drama" to "quiet quakes" is earned by the flood experience. The device-building and filter arrangement show agency under pressure. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("appetite for drama," "kindled humility") but most beats anchor in sensory detail and micro-choices. Amir's presence tests her stance without forcing a full relationship arc, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently specific and embodied ("I circled the ruins of my old life like a moth who remembers"), with micro-choices that reflect a hierarchy of values shaped by trauma. Internal conflict is present—hurrying versus pausing, flame versus caution—and actions align with stated motives. The recovery arc and adaptive stance are credible, but the man with black-stained hands is recalled without enough on-page contradiction or tension to fully dramatize blind spots; the realization feels largely retrospective rather than forcing a present mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interior landscape is consistently rendered through embodied sensation—"like wreckage in black water," the ferry memory surfacing through physical recall. His decisions to engage the equipment and conceptualize the city-wide system arise organically from established trauma and prior expertise. The characterization avoids diagnostic label-speak and maintains contradictory impulses (bewilderment vs. purpose, isolation vs. connection) acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the shift from passive survivor to active designer could show one more micro-choice with visible cost before the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is characterized through consistent interiority—"quietly, densely weary," "mistake exhaustion for duty"—and his profession shapes his perception throughout. The underwater choice feels earned by his established commitment to "give rest a permanent address," though the final line "occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused" slips into abstraction that weakens embodied cost. Internal contradiction is present (duty versus exhaustion) but the climactic decision to shelve unfinished lives could show more visible struggle. The librarian remains functional pressure rather than a fully dimensional presence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—her desire to solve the mystery while preserving community dignity drives clear micro-choices. Kito's entrance and confession feel earned, his smudged sleeves and rice-crumb details grounding his midnight work. The final choice to "declare" rather than expose shows internal contradiction resolved through pressure. Minor: Mara's "gently persistent" trait is told more than demonstrated in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arun's journey from withheld gestures to shared breath with the stranger is earned through the camera's revelation. Interior contradiction appears in the pause between inhaling/exhaling where unused love lingers, embodied through chest-tightness and the swarm of sparks. The progression from observing his own lanterns to releasing one through breath shows agency under pressure. Minor slip: the boy's rapid shift from "tense, phone clenched" to tearful openness compresses emotional movement, though the breathing-synchronization anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives a coherent arc from morning pruning to final dissolution. Interior states are rendered through concrete sensory detail ("warm as fever," "roots pulse like distant drums") rather than labels. However, the climactic dissolution reads more as abstract concept than embodied choice with visible cost—the narrator's agency at the threshold lacks a micro-decision that would make the surrender feel earned rather than inevitable. The reflective mode dominates without sufficient present-tense friction to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interior logic is consistent and her strategic patience manifests in concrete micro-choices (timing the cough, counting pendant swings, studying his key-wear patterns). Internal contradiction appears when she simultaneously embraces chains as strategy while pursuing liberation—a productive tension. The Overseer remains functional but thin; his pacing and ego are asserted more than embodied. Embodied emotion is strong in peak moments ("chain-links rasping like reluctant applause") but occasionally slips into label-speak ("impossibly large").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through synesthetic perception ("I hear colors faintly"), driving the underwater device-testing work. The kitchen memory provides clear backstory anchoring with a visible emotional cost ("bright green turned suddenly mute"). The dual-betrayal realization at the forge—"my partner breaking trust with me; the second was me breaking trust with myself"—is earned and complicates the interior landscape. Minor deduction: some interiority risks label-speak ("the sound of trust breaking") but recovers through specific sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and metaphor-rich ("pressing my ear against destiny's door"), but motivation remains abstract across most beats—the act of stealing faces never gains concrete stakes or visible cost until the final platform encounter. The stranger's instant knowledge ("You brought the jar") and their composite nature feel unmotivated, arriving as revelation rather than earned discovery. The final realization ("moonbeams had not been light at all, but the echo of every gaze") reads as epiphany without prior contradiction or struggle that would make the shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corin's interiority is embodied through gesture and choice (sliding the bookmark into the mold, opening the kiln, placing the vessel on the console). His motivation is particularized—the shift from precision lenses to "safe zones for inquiry"—and arrives with visible cost: "each perfect circle he shaped seemed to tighten around his own chest." The narrator's evolving stance is less fully dramatized; the final shift ("felt my own cautious heart shift, slightly, within its ribs") reads earned but registers as conceptual more than enacted. Minor diagnostic label-speak ("weighty lightness") skirts but does not cross into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior contradictions are embodied: phobia-ridden yet aiming to weaponize vulnerability, shaking hands against steady voice. The encounter with the boy creates a micro-choice—adding her own code to his cast—that shifts her stance toward agency. The final decision to walk into the production office "shaking" but armed with truth is motivated by the prior beats and forecloses passivity with visible cost. Minor slips: "firmly adaptive placeholder" feels like borrowed corporate language rather than lived experience, and the phobia catalog ("knives, crowds, deep water") reads slightly list-like without pressure differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle's contradictory impulses—obsessed with quiet yet drawn to storms—operate simultaneously in scene through her actions (loosening cloak, laying out booklet, closing eyes to count silences). The captain's shift from disuse to engagement shows embodied emotional layering. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("amber hush," "pooled inside") rather than character-particular perception, and the oracle's final choice to lead him feels asserted more than earned by prior micro-decisions that narrow options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    HEPA-3's interiority is consistently particular ("cool ache under every diagnostic report," thoughts from "the space between moments") with embodied perception that avoids label-speak. His micro-choices across loop iterations—refusing, pressing harder, testing whether self-image can change—reflect contradictory impulses (curiosity versus diagnostic routine) acting simultaneously. The final answer to Dr. Roe forecloses simple functionality with visible cost: he has moved from scheduled maintenance to perceiving in doubled frames. Minor: the "curiosity was the wrong term" reflection edges toward over-articulation, though it quickly grounds in sensory metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The registrar's motivation is concrete and embodied—curiosity as "patient parasite," mistrust that "pressed her thoughts flat." Internal contradiction operates in scene: she follows regulations yet unlocks forbidden tech, stays hidden yet walks toward the stranger. The final choice feels earned by the accumulation of shared isolation. Minor slip: the hooded figure's interiority is asserted rather than inferred at the end ("eyes shining with unshed storms").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through physical degradation ("fingers turning first to pain and then to numb wood," "knuckles knotting, skin roughening into barklike whorls") and his choices are motivated by a clear stance against measured luck. His "wisely pragmatic" trait drives the pruning-shears decision and the private ledger system. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous acceptance of death ("when my luck runs out") and his determined cultivation of legacy, though the peak choice to polish marbles and plant commemorative objects feels more thematic than urgently pressured by competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ilen's motivations are clear and rooted in his obliging nature and the delayed connection to his family, which creates resonant interior pressure. His internal monologue about children's delayed jokes and the notion of sideways time demonstrates embodied contradiction. The final choice to adjust the lever is presented as earned through his expertise and reflective stance, though the visible cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Minor slip: the "mechanically warm" attribute is mentioned but not sufficiently dramatized as a constraint or enabler of action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The musician's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear and sustained, with embodied tension in humming intervals and tracing marks. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract musical metaphors ("standing inside someone else's pulse") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "accept the score" feels declarative rather than earned through visible internal conflict with cost. Backstory about the maestro and regime is extensive but remains anchored to present stimuli through the program.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is embodied through contradictory impulses—asking the oracle to tell her what she begged it to forget—and her internal conflict is concretely grounded in the fever memory and physical shivers. The choice to carry the hypothesis forward is earned by prior causality, though the oracle functions more as a sounding board than a fully realized second character with independent pressure. Minor deduction for the line "swaying certainties, not broken yet, but bending toward some unseen pressure," which slightly over-explains an already effective image. The final admission "the weight is mine to carry" lands with visible cost: she accepts isolation and the burden of knowledge her mentors suppressed.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's religiously skeptical stance operates throughout, embodied in the sarcasm ("You really think dead men punched in for overtime") and the final shift where skepticism softens but doesn't vanish ("my religiously skeptical mind catalogues each name like evidence"). Evan's interior contradiction—swallowing truth to protect his livelihood versus the cost of silence—drives the narrative and is paid off when he presses his forehead to the pipe. The confession dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing both character and plot. However, the narrator's arc is more observational than decisional; the final "small rebalancing" reads as emotional witness rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is established through concrete images—"gripped reality loosely, as if it were another brittle page"—and his duty provides consistent motivation. The protagonist's passivity dominates: he witnesses, reads by touch, and steps forward only when the path appears beneath him, with most agency residing in the environment rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to remain at the refuge reads as acceptance rather than a renunciation forged through internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present but the peak decision lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is embodied through concrete anchors—the locked drawer, the guitar tuning ritual—and her professional stance is tested when she must balance residents' unease against her "cautious exuberance." The final beat earns its shift: grief and gratitude "twine instead of clash" because the eclipse moment dramatizes her ability to hold contradiction. Mr. Alvarez and Lake are lightly sketched but serve immediate pressure (his stroke-taken speech, her detox context). Minor slip: Mara's epiphany ("this, too, was ordinary magic she could share") edges toward label-speak, though the keepsake curl image grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Brann's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied perception ("heat bloomed through his circuits") and a clear hierarchy of values around memory and materiality. The motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is consistent and drives micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction appears in "simple and strange, even to himself," though thepiece leans toward contemplation rather than live struggle. The final descent to "the next fireplace" closes with credible endurance rather than transformation, acceptable as Earned Stasis but lacking the forfeiture cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's contradictory stance as both translator and fortune-writer who fears then embraces prophetic power is well-drawn through embodied choices. The internal tension between weary routine and the urge to "transpose life into a new key" drives concrete micro-choices—leading Parker up the lighthouse stairs, rewriting the sequence. Parker's presence adds pressure without muddying the narrator's agency. Minor: the narrator's emotional arc could degrade more visibly under stress; the final self-aware reflection risks flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jonas carries distinct interiority through his philosophy of "unraveling stillness" and his rhetorical approach to exorcism. His embodied action with the ultramarine pigment and loop pedal demonstrate character-specific choices under pressure. The demon's voice is differentiated through its dry mockery, though the girl herself remains passive vessel throughout. The final moment—her shudder as the demon slips free—earns the change through Jonas's prior rhetorical cornering, though we see little of her agency in the release.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's interiority is distinctive and embodied through concrete ritual (nautilus alignment, glass-writing), avoiding stock phrasing. His chronological homesickness drives choices—writing fortunes to "conduct" coincidences—but the final act (raising an invisible baton) lacks visible cost or consequence that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is present (ache sharpening into longing) yet the ending gesture reads as wish fulfillment without dramatized trade-off. Micro-choices throughout (aligning shell, labeling time) are purposeful but don't compound into a peaked decision with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority is vivid and embodied through concrete physical sensations (floating, tablet pressing into forehead), but the emotional arc relies heavily on summary ("it felt as if a dozen fractured timelines scraped") rather than moment-by-moment contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to release the tablet carries visible cost (letting go of the guide), yet the preceding corridor sequence—where he "remade" past choices—reads as exposition of internal process rather than dramatized struggle with trade-offs. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the lack of on-page micro-choices with competing pulls in the peak beats keeps this from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"weight that pressed against her bones," "vacancy cracked"—and her motivation (to defeat numbness) shapes the cavern scene. The children's micro-choices (Jorin pressing his palm, others following) demonstrate embodied emotion under pressure. Minor slip: the students remain somewhat undifferentiated beyond Jorin, and Marlo's role stays functional rather than layered. The final act earns transformation through cumulative sensory contact, though the ending leans slightly toward summary ("numbness thinning like ice") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and character-particular—"meticulous storm recorder," "habit demanded a perimeter sweep"—and the final choice to become a secret chronicler flows from earlier observation habits with visible cost (anchored isolation, professional betrayal). Embodied micro-choices appear throughout: turning the tube, walking the perimeter, closing eyes to listen. Minor slip: the renunciation of ministry service and acceptance of complicity could be sharpened with one contradictory impulse acting in scene rather than a composed readiness that feels settled too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority shows concrete reflection anchored to the present (rope, dust, sky) and micro-choices emerge (unrolling one's own life, recognizing the texture question). The poet, however, remains largely a vessel for philosophy rather than a fully embodied character with contradictory impulses in scene. "Ethically playful sin against time" and similar phrasing veer toward diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. The final choice moment ("The choice was mine alone") arrives as assertion rather than dramatized renunciation or commitment with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elio's progression from street violinist to finding "magnificent simplicity" in the greenhouse is earned through his perceptual bias and family teaching about unfinished beauty. His micro-choices—listening harder, playing incomplete phrases, emptying the bowl—embody his values without therapy-speak. Mara functions well as pressure, though her interiority remains minimal. The final gesture with the bowl crystallizes his stance shift with visible cost (renouncing the ask, choosing to listen instead).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eve's motivation is concrete—her static sense has become unreliable, threatening her professional competence—and her interiority is embodied through the sensation of "static crawling up my fingers." The final shift is earned: she gains calibrated empathy without losing boundaries, a change grounded in prior causality. Internal contradiction appears when she was "raised to hate half truths" yet now her "own clarity felt authoritarian and thin," driving the choice to seek counterfeit emotions. Minor deduction: the dealer reads more as oracle than character with genuine wants; his kindness is "borrowed," flattening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's transformation is motivated by the misdelivered letter, and his resolve to "uplift silent contributors" drives his search for Marin. Interior contradiction appears when he balances "cautious exuberance" and recognizes he's "forgotten how gratitude sounds when it is not attached to payment." The final choice to fund readings is earned, but the character arc resolves a bit quickly; the scheme emerges without visible internal friction or cost that would test competing values. Marin remains more symbolic than individuated—her "whimsically attentive" motions and deflective modesty read as assigned traits rather than constraints that shape a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian's motivation to graft onto community is embodied through concrete choices—settling beside Mira, committing to the collaborative sculpture—and his "permanently greened" hands and sympathetic gaze ground physicality. Internal contradiction appears when he imagines the lattice installation: "not as an intruder but as a thread" shows both yearning and self-doubt acting simultaneously. Mira's arc from "failed cartographer" to laughing recognition under the arbor reads earned, though her emotional pivot at "Stay and scatter" could land with more friction. Minor slip: "boldly sympathetic" feels label-heavy without a scene where that sympathy costs him something tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The illustrator's interiority is embodied through the pendant's physical hum and touch, and the final choice to release the echoes rather than capture them is earned by the earlier realization that "to draw the birthplace of echoes would be to choose which ones survived." Internal contradiction appears when the protagonist claims "I mean to draw it" yet later releases control—this ambivalence drives the climax. The canal keeper functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying direct pressure, and the giant's breathing remains atmospheric rather than forcing concrete micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corren's interiority is specific and textured ("ratios of longing to memory"), and his shift from retrieval to acceptance carries clear motivation. The brother Lio remains a static absence rather than a pressure-producing presence, limiting relational crucible work. The final choice—teaching children to honor absence—feels earned by the conjuring failure but arrives as insight more than embodied cost. Backstory dominates but anchors in present stimuli (the mosaic, the glass eyes) and tilts the stance at closure without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marrow's motivation is clear and his methodical nature shapes his actions consistently. The librarian's interior state is conveyed through embodied moments (hospital antiseptic, raw coffee, shaking frame), though his arc remains largely observed rather than chosen. The sense-memory mechanism risks feeling like a device rather than character-driven interiority; Marrow's final realization ("visible now… through their own awakened senses") borders on epiphany without sufficient on-page struggle. The librarian's breakdown lands with genuine emotional weight, but we lack micro-choices that would deepen his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is concrete and embodied throughout, with contradictory impulses visible in her "circuitously sincere detours" and envy of the linden's unquestioning growth. The final kneeling moment earns its weight through accumulated micro-choices—stopping at the trellis, pocketing the leaf, returning despite knowing she should go home. Internal conflict between her imposed order and the "reluctant metamorphosis pressing inside her" drives the climax with genuine cost: surrender of control she has built her life to maintain. Minor slip: the phrase "reconstructing itself by releasing control" in the tree description slightly anticipates the ending's insight, reducing discovery charge.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's insomnia and compulsion to paint transience ground her choices clearly; her decision to trade the brooch arises from established character logic (threshing meaning, chasing omens wryly). Internal contradiction shows in "never quite believed in them, but never quite risked ignoring them either." The embodied exhaustion ("a thought she could almost think before exhaustion smudged it away") and her walking-by-rain habit anchor her particularities. One micro-deduction: the guard's nod at the checkpoint reads slightly too knowing, verging on convenience, though it remains within earned-stasis range.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's arc from confident seer to humble witness is signaled early and earned through encounter with Mira, with her "certainty crack like thin ice" marking genuine interior shift. The clairvoyant's inability to read the cave's new pattern creates authentic contradiction. Mira's motivation is told more than tested—her months of dreams and village kindnesses are summarized rather than dramatized in choices under pressure. The final acceptance feels contemplative rather than costly; Lyra bows, but no prior path is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is sustained through specific embodied details (salt-wet boards soaking her skirt, the valve's chill against her wrist) and her archival motivation shapes micro-choices throughout. The final beat—waiting reactively until Caven reaches for the valve and produces the tremulous note—embodies her core contradiction of passive agency without therapy-speak. Old Caven's characterization is economical: his scarred throat and sea-salt beard give him texture, and his hesitant attempt to sound again feels earned by the exile backstory. Minor deduction: the crowd's collective awakening ("shoulders uncurling") verges on summary rather than individuated reaction, slightly flattening the interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Adrian's motivation is rooted in his professional identity as a mapper and his curiosity, with embodied tension ("breath that shook the dust in his lungs"). His interior voice is consistent and particular, filtering the world through cartographic metaphor. The final choice to "dare the darkness to redraw him" arrives with visible cost—crossing into the unknown—but the decision feels somewhat inevitable given his characterization rather than earned through genuine internal conflict. The conductor's appearance introduces a second character cleanly, though their exchange tilts toward thematic statement rather than pressured negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and textured, with embodied emotion ("memories tingled across my skin") and genuine internal conflict between doubt and wonder. The sympathetic skeptic trait operates consistently through micro-choices (checking the tile for powders, resolving to transcribe until dawn). The final choice—to hold both skepticism and wonder without breaking—emerges from prior causality and forecloses the easier path of pure dismissal. Minor weakness: some reflection edges toward abstraction ("our entangled memories became a bridge") without full embodiment in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The immortal's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I am tired of pages that never turn"), with embodied perception through dimensional awareness. The fragment functions as externalized internal conflict, and the final choice to "loosen anchors" demonstrates agency with visible cost. Minor slip: the philosophical dialogue with the artifact risks abstraction, though it's recovered by sensory grounding and the protagonist's contemptuous silence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is concrete and embodied throughout—"honest child, the one who held the coats"—with clear internal contradictions that drive the final choice. The decision to split the equation emerges from prior pressure (asylum vs. network survival) with visible cost: complicity in partial concealment. Minor slip: the magical ink "liquefies rigid thinking" functions more as atmospheric conceit than grounded trait, softening the earned quality of the insight slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurelio's interior world is concrete and specific—pressing leaves against pages, treating imaginary archives like scrolls—and his craft history anchors motivation. The invented histories emerge from his studious trait and gilding background with embodied continuity. Internal conflict between escape and collection is present but could press harder; the final choice to wait "is enough" reads as acceptance with visible cost (carrying the archive home, the lamp extinguished) but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat. Minor: "incandescent restraint" appears as narratorial label rather than lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior world is rendered through specific, embodied perception—salt smell, rope roughness, metallic taste—that accumulates sensory memory in lieu of conventional psychological arc. The central choice to write a new certificate "in pencil" with a blank name line carries weight, though the journey there leans heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The renunciation of his "old story" is earned by the accumulation of overheard fragments, but the final gesture feels more like acceptance than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains concrete, anchored in port textures.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tamsin's interiority is concrete and sharply rendered—her professional skepticism and half-swallowed longing for meaning drive micro-choices (lifting the shell, touching the cello, finally leaving). Interior contradiction appears in her "gloomy cheerfulness" and her simultaneous impulse to break myths and to find a truer story. Embodied emotion is vivid: "shame bloom like slow rust," "a sound like a dropped screw." The final departure with "her unanswered compass" constitutes Earned Stasis—she accepts ignorance as companionable rather than defeating—but the cost (never fully concluding) is felt rather than forfeited on the page, keeping the score out of the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jae's internal contradiction between Carnival Row loyalty and Planning Office pragmatism is embodied through the burning foundation stone chip, and the final choice between "stay and fight, or help our people slip away" is earned by prior causality. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hopeful desperation," "orderly intuitive") rather than staying concrete. The relationship with Lilo adds pressure but could show more micro-choices that visibly foreclose options. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes filtered through retrospective summary rather than immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilya's interiority is specific and embodied—"dawnlit melancholy settled in his chest, heavy and patient, like dust refusing to rise"—and his micro-choices (pressing his glove into dust, choosing the amber vial over red) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The daughter relationship supplies credible internal conflict between duty and preservation instinct. Minor slip: the "purposefully curious in a career that punished curiosity" feels like assigned trait rather than dramatized contradiction, though the choice to photograph and leave his own print partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is rendered through concrete sensory choices—listening to vibrations, tracing air, reading pitch for angles—that embody his blindness as lived constraint rather than label. His care for the hummingbird ("as gently as if it were a nervous animal") and teaching stance ("Direction is not a straight road") show interiority rooted in craft practice. Clara functions primarily as witness and prompt; her presence keeps the shop from feeling sterile but does not generate meaningful relational pressure. The closure choice—releasing the drone to follow "the pulling song of rails and sea"—feels thematically earned but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed option; Elias smiles in quiet satisfaction without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—"the familiar, subtly confident twitch in my fingers"—with strong sensory grounding and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The editor's professional identity shapes perception (maps, contour lines, approval initials) and the final act of kneeling to sketch "the first honest revision I had made in years" earns the shift with visible cost. Internal conflict between official certainty and physical evidence operates simultaneously rather than in tidy stages. Minor slip: the falcon's "dry" stare reads slightly stock, and some emotional progression could degrade more under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ansel is embodied through soot-dark hands, measured footsteps, and infinite patience tested on the page. His motivation—restoring balance—manifests in micro-choices: waiting, calibrating rhythm, reversing paths, and smiling at the bell's tremor. The flashback to his prior life as bell tuner is substantial (~15% of text) but anchored in present action (touching the tuning fork) and primes his craft-driven stance at closure. The woman's arrival lacks interiority; she exists as a signal rather than a second agent, keeping focus tight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and specific—sensory memories triggered by the vial (citrus soap, smoke, ocean) anchor present perception through embodied detail. The protagonist's choice to "surrender to the vial's slow intake" reads as earned by the established isolation and professional stance, though the shift from scientist to archive lacks a visible on-page micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. The final stance—"becoming its final, solitary archive"—forecloses survival with felt cost, meeting Earned Stasis criteria. Minor deduction: the moment of decision compresses instinct and override without dramatizing internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through sustained listening and spatial mapping, with clear motive (rehabilitate father's legacy via story-craft). The father's teaching provides concrete backstory that tilts present choices. However, the climactic turn—realizing men "vanish into sentences"—arrives as assertion rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost, and the final cloak image registers more as metaphor than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. ambition) remains implicit rather than acting simultaneously in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("fingers closing around the bead," "words struck the bead, and something rang inside my chest"). The internal contradiction between doubt and commitment builds steadily, and the final vow feels earned by the vision-triggered memory rather than purely rational choice. Minor weakness: the ghost bride's motivations are dramatized primarily through dialogue rather than contradictory action, and the protagonist's embodied emotion occasionally dips into elevated register ("mournful elation, grief braided with a sweetness too intense to bear") that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orren's interior life is richly embodied through his calloused hands, his overlapping sleepwalking paths, and his micro-choices with the awl and plate. His motivation to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" is physicalized through repeated acts of sewing and engraving, with internal contradiction visible when anger rises then "settle[s] into a steadier resolve." The emotional arc from quiet despair to active remediation shows embodied progression, though the final choice feels more like continuation than a decisive fork with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leila's interiority is concrete and specific—"suspended between languages, between airports, between unfinished prayers"—and her contradictory impulses (scholar vs. believer, observer vs. restorer) act simultaneously on the page. Her micro-choices carry visible cost: proposing the teaching garden risks rejection but forecloses pure detachment. The final turn toward "fragile continuity" and root-like faith feels earned by her cumulative devotion to the stone and villagers' stories. Rafi's secondary presence applies pressure without stealing focus, though his arc remains sketched rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Neve's interiority is vivid and particular—the clipboard as "portable altar," names "leak[ing] into the margins"—and their micro-choices (drawing the fake option, coding in chalk) layer professional habit with personal history. The relationship with Arlen arrives via sidewalk-chalk symbols, anchoring regret without over-explaining. Internal contradiction surfaces when they question whether the message is "for the anonymous sender, for Arlen, or for some earlier version of themself," showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final hesitation at the slot embodies embodied reluctance with visible cost, though the change remains a renunciation/Charged Poise rather than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation and performance register clearly—she disguises wisdom as foolishness through deliberate miscounting and tea-spilling—but her internal contradiction never materializes in scene choices; she tells the prince what he wants to hear without visible cost or conflicting impulse in the moment. The prince's fever of rebellion is declared rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. Both characters remain instrumentally consistent, serving theme and atmosphere over messy human contradiction, which keeps the score out of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's interiority is vividly embodied ("fierce tenderness rising in her, sharp enough to cut yet careful not to pierce") and her emotional state shifts under pressure from professional detachment to empathic recognition. The drowned brother's moment of choice—pride clamping his tongue—shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than in sequence. The client remains off-page, which is appropriate to scope, and the spirits function well as environmental pressure. One minor weakness: Lysa's professional competence lacks visible struggle; her mastery reads smooth where a moment of doubt or miscalculation would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—her translation work becomes a crucible for moral choice, especially in the lie she tells about the smudged line. The boy's anesthetic-floating voice and his mother's exhaustion are rendered through gesture and concrete detail rather than labels. Internal contradiction appears when Mara acknowledges the lie as "careful" and "lotus-hearted," showing simultaneous guilt and conviction. The final micro-choice—pocketing the coral and following the gurney—forecloses witness in favor of complicity, with visible cost in her reflected fear.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and specific—his memory of city murals forbidden, his move to illicit projectors, the realization that "he was not resurrecting his own glory… but letting everyone else's brightest moments breathe again." Embodied emotion appears in "absurdly, like an intruder," "pensive mirth," and his careful handling of moss. However, the final realization arrives through summary reflection rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, limiting the score's upper reach.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's internal arc from certainty to curiosity is signaled early and shapes the restoration choices, but the transformation feels abstract rather than viscerally embodied. The hobo nickel and the tramp's warning anchor motivation, yet the pivotal decision to "abandon the restoration plan" lacks a dramatized cost—no patron conflict, no professional consequence shown. The lapis woman's awakening and the narrator's reply ("I know less than I thought") land as conceptual rather than felt, missing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Interiority skews toward lyric meditation rather than character-particular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen is established through voice and choices—forging permits, navigating Ministry rules—with consistent roguish competence. The entomologist's moment ("when thoughts became taxable, her students stopped asking why") delivers genuine interiority, but most secondary figures (Mara, Jin) remain functional placeholders distinguished only by props (satchel, seedlings). The core motivation ("stand guard over your own spark of defiance") is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses, and no visible choice forecloses a path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is established early and drives the action through the moon's absence. His interior logic—singing a lullaby to negotiate with the sea—reads as character-specific and rooted in grandmother's instruction. However, the coral blooming and moon's return feel externally granted rather than won by his contradiction or cost; his choice to sing carries emotional weight but not a visible forfeiture that tests competing impulses. The final rest feels like reward rather than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The caretaker's interiority is filtered through highly stylized perception ("the exact texture of how they once trembled on a tongue"), but his micro-choices under pressure remain clear: he repairs the chime, then decides to preserve the wandering melody. The decision to hum and archive the new name shows agency with visible cost (the glow fades, leaving "something almost, but not quite, saved"). Internal contradiction is present but muted—his question about who preserved his own name flickers without forcing a decisive reckoning. Embodiment is consistent (bare feet, breath on the opal sliver) and avoids label-speak, keeping the piece in the upper-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and their reflective interiority is distinct ("cowardice," "fear prickled"), but the story relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously. The Arithene vow mechanism provides cognitive constraint ("any attempt would snag"), but the protagonist's micro-choices under pressure remain largely cerebral—copying text, feeling relief—rather than embodied struggle with competing impulses. The final resolution (stepping out with "new music") is earned by the archive work, though the change reads more as equipped confidence than a choice that foreclosed a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlen's interior is established through concrete sensory work (chain sliding through fingers, reading smudged ink via adhesive analysis), and his professional identity as floodgate machinist constrains his approach to the city's problem. The council members remain largely undifferentiated despite occupational tags (mill captain, priest, noblewoman), functioning more as voices than individuals. The final collective adjustment of the chain shows agency, but Arlen's internal contradiction and cost feel muted—his trembling is mentioned but the stakes of failure for him personally remain abstract. His belief that "every machine, every law, was a kind of encrypted compassion" operates more as thematic declaration than lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Noel's interiority is concrete and character-specific—using dust motes to plan routes shows contradiction between mysticism and guilt-driven avoidance. The woman's arrival forces a choice, and his final act of writing the song embodies change with visible cost (releasing what he's hoarded). Minor slip: the sister's belief in "falling stones" feels slightly over-articulated for the moment, brushing against thematic echo. Internal conflict is embodied throughout, particularly in the balance metaphor that recurs with shifting weight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator shows a consistent perceptual signature filtered through inherited spatial obsession ("necessary distances," reading grain as weather). The core interiority is embodied: the house hovering, furniture that won't touch, physical immersion in the maze from "inside a stalk." The final renunciation—staying on the opposite side of that one-step strip—is motivated by accumulated understanding and carries visible relational cost. Minor weakness: the father's thinness "erased and redrawn" edges toward abstract metaphor rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("a knot of smoke that had lived there since the village burned"), with motivation evolving through on-page micro-choices (dimming the lights, redesigning cycles). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the sky-reader's expertise and underwater uselessness, driving genuine struggle. The final shift—from seeking fixed belonging to recognizing it as "the interval between breaths shared in noticing"—is earned through prior causality, though the epiphany skirts close to label-speak at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interior texture is consistent—patient, methodically melancholic, driven by archival duty—and his final acceptance ("Not yet, but soon") earns stasis through visible cost: acknowledgment that completion is perpetually deferred. Embodied emotion shines in "a small dark crab skittering in his thoughts" and the "soft laugh that echoed strangely, half-mirth and half-mourning." Minor penalty: the traveler's path and Lio's conjecture feel somewhat abstract; the stakes remain atmospheric rather than urgently personal, limiting the depth of internal contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is given analytical traits and a distinct professional identity (street performer of "orchestrated serendipity"), but his interior life remains largely expositional rather than embodied. The micro-choices—reading the crowd, placing the bishop, guiding attention—show deliberate action, but emotional contradiction is minimal; he executes his plan smoothly without meaningful internal friction or self-doubt. The woman in red receives a moment of interiority ("considering unseen lines of escape from a life she had not yet admitted was trapping her"), yet this insight arrives unearned, a convenience rather than a dramatized realization. No visible cost forecloses a path for Marcus; his purpose "unclenches" in satisfaction rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mareh's motivation to inscribe forbidden memory is clear and her trade-off—losing her brother's face to give the stranger a map—lands with embodied cost. The stranger remains functional but thin, present only to receive the verse. Interior contradiction appears ("elective exile trembles") but doesn't act simultaneously in scene; the decision to proceed feels linear rather than torn. The final cost is concrete and poignant, lifting the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glazier narrator demonstrates a coherent perceptual signature—reading light, glass fractures mirroring shorelines—and the final choice to write an unquantifiable estimate emerges from established values. However, the interior leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("glass, too, is only sand convinced to stand still") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision at closure feels more like restated philosophy than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost; Kade's laugh signals no real opposition, reducing the felt stakes of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rafe's interiority is concrete and embodied through the porcelain box and burn scars, with clear motivation rooted in protective guilt. The teenage backstory moment ("I could protect him or stay pure...but not both") shows genuine internal conflict. Maya's shock and trembling fingers are embodied, though her role is primarily receptive. The confession itself feels slightly over-articulated for a peak beat, but the choice to speak aloud carries visible cost in the scraping metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "logical dreamer" protagonist shows clear interior contradiction—wanting to revitalize through gentler numbers while fearing the gauge's implications—and micro-choices (arranging objects, testing patterns) reveal values under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "hush roared in my ears" and "flash of grief," though some interiority leans toward abstraction ("statistics of collapse"). The final choice to rehang the orbs is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of apathy with visible cost, but the peak moment lacks the visceral particularity that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("listening the way a wall listens"), with embodied perceptions ("vibration I sensed...in my ribs") that avoid label-speak. The final choice—to stay and continue Mara's work—is earned by prior causality, though the emotional trajectory from discovery to commitment could show more internal contradiction or cost in the moment of decision. Minor slip: the kinship with Mara is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Still, the arc from cartographer to inheritor is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's interior is carefully rendered through the borrowed heartbeat metaphor and the specific mechanics of their gift, with embodied perception filtering sensory detail through their purpose. The girl's entrance introduces a clear relationship dynamic that forces a choice—to teach or refuse—though her characterization is thinner. Internal contradiction operates subtly: the painter's awareness of the heartbeat's eventual return creates a persistent shadow cost beneath their grace. Minor deduction for the girl's perceptive calm reading more as authorial mirroring than earned trait, and the fisherman's daughter/baker/boy vignettes remain ornamental rather than applying pressure to the protagonist's stake.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The negotiator's interiority is embodied through gesture (clipboard held "like fragile armor") and his professional discipline worn "like a too-heavy coat." His contradiction—disgust at compromise yet commitment to civilian survival—drives the climactic choice to offer "survivable disappointment." The general and envoy are sketched with enough specificity (scar tissue, thread-knotted ankles) to apply distinct pressure, though their interior lives remain thin. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" appears twice as a label without fully dramatized cost in action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and singular—"philanthropy as misdirection, generosity as alibi"—with embodied contradiction between ruthlessness and the trembling hands that hold the egg. Internal conflict operates simultaneously: he intellectualizes the bird chorus as "echo trapped in the architecture of the world" while privately knowing it as weakness. The final kneeling gesture with whitening knees carries visible cost (suit damage, physical submission) that forecloses the purely amoral stance, though the change reads more as Charged Poise than full transformation. Minor slip: "dangerously close to devotion" slightly over-articulates what the trembling hands already show.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iri's character is established through action and interior stance—her refusal as choice, not absence—and her final defiance carries visible cost ("knowing the king would sense the shift and call it treason"). The descent and the weaving of echoes show agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans on elevated abstractions ("every unspoken desire bent around her like light around glass") that distance us from embodied contradiction, and the moment of choice feels more conceptual than viscerally motivated by prior dramatic struggle. The chastity-as-fierce-choice frame is asserted late rather than tested on the page through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"ink dries fastest when people below are on fire" captures both craft obsession and emotional distance. Internal contradiction operates throughout: detachment as fear, puppet shows as reversed confession, the desire to stay clean while choosing staining work. The final turn toward mutual perspective-taking feels earned by prior causality, and the cost of vulnerability is embodied in "made my throat ache." Backstory about the prizewinning short anchors present choices effectively within BRR allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Erin's motivation is embodied through concrete action—braiding grass, arranging stone, hanging the moth wing—and her internal conflict ("the old knot pulled her toward action instead of grief") drives micro-choices throughout. The interiority is consistently character-particular ("an esoteric realist with pockets full of string and a head full of ghosts"), avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation—accepting the monarch's imminent death while honoring its arrival—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of helpless grief with visible cost. Minor cap applied: the protagonist operates alone, so relationship/status dynamics are not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc—from guilt-bearer to sound-caster—is traced through concrete micro-choices (touching the rope, imagining absence as mold), and the final stance (staying to cast in sound) forecloses the metal-only path with visible cost. Interiority is specific ("the old, stiff apology lodged behind my tongue"), but some reflection edges toward abstraction ("my guilt is the wax") without full embodiment. The caretaker's "technically gentle eyes that still measured every flaw" is vivid, yet her function remains more symbolic than pressuring; she observes rather than forcing a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist demonstrates contradictory impulses: obedience versus desire for discovery, duty to the bunker versus invitation from the road. The final choice to climb rather than seal himself in is motivated by the accumulated dream-pressure and the voice from the bridge. Internal states are embodied through concrete details like "gravel in his boots" and "heat building behind the metal." Minor weakness: the protagonist's shift from interpretive obedience to open rebellion could use one more on-page micro-choice in the middle third to fully earn the climactic renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Tammuz's motivations are clear and consistent—his frugal devotion to measurement, his willingness to gamble years on a hunch. His internal contradiction between empirical rigor and unquantifiable longing is embodied in concrete choices (salvaging the tile, rigging the lights, recording offsets). The final renunciation—walking out "richer by a question he could never exhaust"—is earned by the preceding causality and forecloses certainty with visible cost. Minor: the colleagues' joke about "empirically ironic" devotion arrives as summary rather than dramatized pressure, slightly weakening interiority specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout ("my resentment had grown heavier than my bones"). The protagonist's contradictory impulses—clinging to fury while seeking relief—operate simultaneously in scene, particularly when the car memory surfaces and she feels herself reaching for her brother while blaming him. The final shift is earned through embodied realization ("the hurt moved differently, no longer a blade, more like a splinter working itself outward"), and Ilen's characterization as a "scheming pacifist" whose "campaigns of compassion" are visible in his tactical patience shows embodied contradiction. Minor deduction: Ilen's interiority remains somewhat opaque, though his role as guide justifies limited access.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is characterized through concrete action (mirror-making craft, synchronized breathing) and his interiority shows embodied tension when he worries briefly about losing himself but grounds himself with the feel of cobbles. His motivation to capture the dream drives coherent choices across beats. The final merging moment feels earned by prior causality, though the arc leans heavily on atmospheric accumulation rather than sharp internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mender's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific parental failure: signing a contract that betrayed his daughter's dreams. Internal conflict manifests through the tension between his trade (glass-mending) and his daughter's vision (grafting life from ruin), and the ribbon becomes an embodied tether to regret. The final bargain with the trees—offering caretaking until her return—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of enforced ownership with felt cost. Minor slip: the daughter's voice in the final rustle reads slightly convenient, though it lands as possibility rather than certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is presented through vivid interiority—"bewilderment was not incompetence but overflow"—and contradictory impulses appear in his simultaneous avoidance and pursuit of forbidden knowledge. The psychological texture is consistent and specific, with embodied confusion filtered through his role. However, the final choice to step through the mirror feels under-motivated; we see observation and philosophical musing but minimal on-page struggle or competing wants that would make the crossing a genuine foreclosure of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysa's motivation to rescue her brother is clear and drives her choices, particularly the final margin-writing decision. Internal contradiction appears in her negotiation with the clerk—she's resourceful yet already surrendered her happiest memory. The brother's loss feels somewhat abstract until the circular chamber reveal, and the final choice to "accompany" rather than "rewrite" reads earned but arrives late. Interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is richly textured with contradictions—cataloging anomalies for a living while seeking their own strangeness—and the "unkindled solace" motive carries embodied tension. However, the twin remains mostly a philosophical mirror rather than a fully individuated character with their own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to "stay" and "rewrite us together" feels somewhat abstract; the renunciation of the recapture mission is present but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt through a specific forfeiture or micro-choice that narrows options. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays image-driven, which elevates the work, but the twin's dual outline and smoke-audience staging read more symbolic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysa's interior is consistently methodical and embodied through archival work, with her hands moving "with their usual, calmly precise rhythm." Her motivation to translate confusion into clarity drives the rope-braiding choice, though the peak decision feels somewhat abstract—she "considers" rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses in real time. The final step back "carrying careful remembrance" registers as renunciation with cost, but the emotional stakes remain slightly distant. Minor: the parchment in her own handwriting could have sparked sharper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper's interiority is richly embodied through tactile and sensory choices (pressing the stone to his tongue, reading walls like Braille), and his goal remains consistent under pressure. Micro-choices—pausing to let resonance strike, following fracture-patterns—reveal a hierarchy of values tied to his craft. The ending choice to conjure hush is earned by prior sensory mapping and the teacher's remembered wisdom, with visible cost in the stillness forged against chaos. Minor deduction: the energy beings remain abstract antagonists without on-page friction that would test internal contradiction more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Keeper's interiority is concrete and particular—retrocognition is embodied through physical action (barefoot on thresholds, forehead pressed to glass) rather than merely labeled. His motivation to recover his childhood plea carries visible contradiction: the universe that swallowed his voice owes him nothing, yet he persists. The final moment earns its cost: recognizing his own child-voice proves the plea survived but confirms no rescue ever came, a bittersweet validation that rekindles him withoutResolver the original loss. Minor deduction: the voice remains consistently poetic-elevated throughout, with no stress-driven compression or syntactic breakdown at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and embodied through his handling of quills and crystals, with "preemptive nostalgia" manifesting as physical chest-tightening when he watches shadows shift. His motivation to preserve collective memory drives consistent micro-choices (pausing midstroke, working faster, calculating seasons). However, the piece operates at such distance that internal contradiction never surfaces—he remains a contemplative observer executing his role without competing impulses or genuine struggle that would force a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The designer's interiority is vivid and particular ("filters them through his ribcage," "steady ache shaped like a question mark facing upward"), with embodied contradiction between his serious playfulness and the soldiers' skepticism. His motivation to counter despair through spectacle is legible and drives micro-choices throughout (kneeling by crates, studying the knot, arranging shells). The captain and messenger remain functional pressures rather than developed characters, appropriate for this length. Minor deduction: the protagonist's arc lacks a visible transformation or renunciation with felt cost at closure—he completes his design as planned without a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is concrete and character-particular, rooted in professional observation translated into personal stakes. The decision to go inland emerges through embodied hesitation (touching the pool, watching reflections shudder) rather than neat epiphany. The contradiction between wanting the sea's rhythm and needing Lysa is enacted rather than explained. Internal conflict operates simultaneously through gesture and perception, though the final choice arrives more as seepage than dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's voice is distinctive and their claustrophobia/collecting duality creates genuine interior contradiction. The father's arc from "design flaw" dismissal to shared vocabulary feels earned through the gravity inversion experience. Embodied moments are strong ("my fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots"), though some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("an intangibly tangible awareness") that dilutes specificity. The final shared moment credibly forecloses the old conflict with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rian's interior motivation is established early—teaching silence to comfort—and his "fluidly logical" thinking appears in his actions with the storm glass and the experiment. The passengers' arc from tension to stillness is embodied in gestures (bag settling, fist unclenching, mechanical bird winding down), though their individual interiorities remain thin. The final shift feels more ambient than driven by Rian's agency; he watches rather than chooses at closure, which weakens the earned-cost test. No head-hopping or label-speak at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilya's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("wisely adventurous," archival bands glowing with borrowed memories), and his micro-choices at the wall and stairway show meaningful deliberation. However, the final refusal—pressing the ruby into the stair instead of accepting the throne—arrives without on-page friction or visible internal contradiction; the decision reads as inevitable rather than earned by competing impulses acting in scene. The body and perception details are strong, but the climax choice lacks dramatized cost or hesitation that would lift it past competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's journey from isolation to tentative breathing is embodied through concrete images—warm metal, aligned scars, her breath hitching—and the shadow keeper's coaching feels earned by the sanctuary's accumulation of her prior departures. Interior states are mostly shown, though "tired of hovering" and the framing of drowning vs. being seen edge toward summary. The final choice to breathe differently is visible on the page, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific forfeiture; we don't see what bridge-burning habit she must abandon or what relationship she might now attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"her throat tightened," the bolt "warmed, then tugged downward"—and her trajectory from pyramid-scheme survivor to mushroom farmer is causal and particular. The final choice (grasping the hatch) is earned by her established pattern of stepping forward when asked and by the pressure of accumulating promises. Internal contradiction is present: she distrusts shortcuts yet reaches for a new door. Micro-choices throughout (checking moisture, texting variants, approaching the hatch) reveal values under rising pressure, though the volunteer trait is told more than dramatized in a prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aurel's interiority is grounded in concrete action—turning the crank, adjusting the needle—and his motivation (seeking the hidden truth behind the collapse) drives the scene's choices. The contradictory impulses are present but somewhat muted: his simultaneous custodianship and search for agency appears more in summary than in embodied conflict. Mara exists only in reflection without applying direct pressure, and the queen's voice arrives as discovery rather than antagonist. The final moment where he "pictures standing waves" and "felt the way a tiny crest of possibility could topple a whole, brittle pattern" edges toward abstraction rather than a visceral choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Calder's interiority is concrete and embodied—"feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed," "vows like rust beneath his skin"—and his contradictory impulses (duty vs. doubt) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to stay but not serve is earned by the greenhouse's pressure and the marionette metaphor. However, the insight "They were not loyalty...but a choreography" edges toward tidy diagnostic labeling, and Mira's wisdom-dispenser role lacks personal friction or cost; she applies pressure without risking anything herself.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particularized through embodied choices (trailing fingers through dust, speaking names aloud). Her motivation—finding herself through saving others—creates genuine internal contradiction that drives micro-choices across the file room. The visiting foster youth are briefly sketched but functional; the man recognizing the button delivers an earned moment. Minor slip: the ex-partner's complaint about "evidence, not home" edges toward diagnostic articulation, though it remains in dialogue rather than peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio demonstrates internal contradiction through the quiet accusation of the key and the hesitation at the lagoon, showing contradictory impulses. However, interiority leans abstract—"plans unravel" and "coded freedom" appear as labels rather than embodied perception. The final act of speaking memories until "throat ached" provides some somatic anchoring, but earlier beats rely on conceptual layering ("small ritual of surrender," "tyranny of indifference") that reads more thematic than character-particular. The choice to distribute the code strip is implied rather than shown as a micro-choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The saxophonist's motivation to undo the prophecy is well-rooted in guilt and the backstory justifies his ritualized attempts. His internal contradiction—between wanting to amend the past and fearing he's ineffective—drives the grotto scenes. The moment of "refusal" (leaving spaces where fatal notes should lie) embodies agency with visible cost, though the final sensing of loosened future reads slightly abstract. Embodiment is strong in the horn's "long unheard-of chord that tasted like dust," but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("burden belonged to him") nudges interiority toward summary in one or two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority is sustained through concrete micro-choices—prodding leaves, building monuments, answering the voice aloud—and the final planting decision feels earned by prior causality. The character remains consistent across beats, translating listening into action with visible cost (opening the floor, pressing seeds). Weakness: the transformation lacks embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; Lio's progression reads more as steady realization than internal conflict. The voice's appearance bypasses genuine struggle, delivering insight rather than forcing Lio to wrestle competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Eli's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("coincidence becomes pattern," the habit of listening rather than repairing). His micro-choices—lifting floorboards, touching the compass, deciding to improvise—accumulate and earn the final turn toward befriending uncertainty. Internal contradiction operates well: he spent a life banishing Perhaps yet now allows it as direction. Minor slip: the epiphany about time and improvisation edges toward summary ("he considered that planning did not need to be…") rather than full embodiment at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eira's internal landscape is rendered through distinct, embodied perception—"carrying her refusal like another lantern"—and her motives are layered (grief, alchemical purpose, defiance of finality). The brother Arlen exists only in memory and vision, so relationship pressure is oblique; Eira's choice to "offer her own name as solder" shows contradictory impulses (staying/going) acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "balanced alchemist" remains a label without on-page demonstration of what balance costs her in this moment, and the final renaming feels more conceptual than a visceral forfeiture that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is grounded in her brother's death and manifests through concrete choices—descending the gorge, biting the tooth ritual, coaxing spectral confessions toward absurdity. Her interiority is specific ("modestly fearless," the tooth as persuasion metaphor) and her task of teaching the dead to laugh creates embodied pressure. Minor limitation: the spectral voices feel more like choral device than individual pressures testing her method; their quick compliance flattens potential resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's proprioceptive hyperawareness is embodied consistently through concrete sensory detail ("shoulders brace on their own," "ribs remembered compressions"). Interior contradiction operates effectively in the final choice—the body's defensive brace transforms into a preparatory one, marking agency through embodied shift rather than stated epiphany. Backstory is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the mask strap, the forest hum) and tilts the present stance via micro-choices throughout. Minor weaknesses: some interiority edges toward diagnostic register ("proprioceptively enhanced balance") and the final paragraph's "angle chosen instead of imposed" approaches explaining what the prior embodiment already showed.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to honor overlooked histories is established early and shapes key choices, but interiority leans heavily on reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The shame at the end ("I thought of a boy whose testimony I had once softened") arrives as summary rather than dramatized struggle. Micro-choices (accepting the shard, listening to the alchemist) feel passive and reception-oriented rather than forcing difficult trade-offs. The final reflective turn lacks visible cost that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is highly specific—elevator mechanic's observational idiom filtering the ghost-world—and micro-choices (kneeling, analyzing dust, touching the barrel) are embodied and purposeful. Internal contradiction is present ("against every training manual and most of my better instincts") and the final act of engagement is earned by curiosity-as-flaw. The ghost-boy functions as secondary pressure but remains thin; the final choice feels slightly under-motivated because we don't see what the protagonist sacrifices or risks by engaging the barrel beyond abstract instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ilen's motive is stated but largely abstract; his decision to uncork the whisper and pull the lever happens without visceral internal contradiction or embodied hesitation. The chief librarian's alarm feels generic rather than rooted in a particular professional fear. The ending avoids earned cost—Ilen "smiled without triumph" and suggests shelving by feelings, but no path is foreclosed and no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—"old chants surface, not as slogans, but as questions" shows internal contradiction. Her motivation to "reimagine the entire civilization" drives micro-choices: picking up the shard, descending, covering mirrors. The final choice to preserve "reimagined futures from leaking away" is earned by prior causality. Elyas remains functional but thin, serving primarily as a foil for Mara's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through his sensory gift ("listening for fractures," "veins prickled," "wilted near dishonesty") and his choices alter tactics under pressure—he refuses to touch the corrupt lantern, identifies the rust's lie, then builds the music box solution. Internal contradiction appears when he drifts into the covenant's perspective ("it had only ever wanted the comfort of a truthful song"), creating momentary distance from his own agency. The Mayor remains functional but one-note; the rust personification hovers between external force and internalized metaphor without settling into either cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias demonstrates consistent interiority through his sensory collector's lens and the psychometry reading provides embodied contradiction—he pursues rationality while experiencing visceral visions. His micro-choices (opening jars, capturing scents, touching the compass despite knowing what will happen) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to sit in the boat and accept the uncertainty feels earned by the accumulated pressure of his grandmother's teaching and the factory visions. Minor gap: the transition from collector to active delver could show more internal resistance to raise the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior voice is vivid and specific ("wind yanking," "sand grains…like tiny reprimands"), and her sculptor's lens shapes perception throughout. Her decision to reimagine the archway and carry the slide away shows embodied choice under pressure. However, the shift from collecting driftwood to becoming part of a timewoven alliance feels abrupt; the final turn lacks visible cost—she simply drives away with a question, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira's motivation is established through consistent traits (paint-stained fingers, questioning nature, trust in stories), and his micro-choices—touching the postcard, climbing the stair, sketching the window mechanism—reveal character under pressure. Liora's introduction is vivid ("coat dark as unlit glass," "umbral tenderness") and her knowledge creates immediate tension. However, the final transformation feels more told than earned: "understanding" settles between them without a visible cost or prior internal contradiction that the moment resolves. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("question that would not loosen") rather than embodied particulars, and Ira's agency at closure is passive reception rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris's interiority is vivid and embodied ("breath a torn cloth"), and her commitment to archival truth under pressure is consistent. However, her agency peaks early in the descent; the lagoon encounter offers mystical communion more than genuine choice under competing pressures. The final whispered promise feels declared rather than dramatically earned through a visible tradeoff that forecloses an alternative path with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's interior life is richly textured—his rejection of false comfort drives on-page choices (refusing simple revival, scraping rust, conceiving new patterns). Embodied contradictions appear: he keeps the wish "like a shard lodged under the tongue" yet uses that enhanced working memory to circle problems. The final stance—reimagining civilization rather than restoring it—is earned through prior reflection and micro-choices. Minor slip: the townspeople's exodus and his isolation are told rather than shown in a pivotal beat, slightly weakening the stakes' felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lan's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("dead languages the way some men collected rings, each dialect a loop of obligation around his heart"), with embodied perception through the archival method. The classroom memory grounds his present technique without exposition. Minor weakness: Maro remains functional but underdeveloped; his tension is told ("the word broke oddly in his mouth") rather than consistently shown through micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradictions and embodied emotion come through strongly: "furiously tranquil," fingers tingling with curiosity despite claimed reluctance, and the breathing-sync moment before acceptance. The choice to pay in years carries visible cost and emerges from prior causality. Minor slips include the curator Myra being slightly underdrawn and some recycled gestural patterns (Myra touching the acorn cap, folding hands). The final choice forecloses the path of walking away with palpable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's interiority is richly embodied through concrete sensory anchors—the amber seam, the rope's rasp, his heartbeat count—and his internal conflict between listening and noise is dramatized in micro-choices: uncoiling the rope, tying the knot, then stepping away. The choice to favor listening over siren carries visible cost (potential valley deaths) and forecloses the path of noise. Minor deduction: his professional competence never stumbles under peak pressure; the mentor's aphorisms occasionally drift toward received wisdom rather than character-specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The janitor's interior life is embodied through concrete action—lifting the glass, watching projections, dropping his broom—and his spiritual curiosity manifests in listening posture rather than declaration. The move from invisibility to witness is earned through accumulated micro-choices. Internal contradiction appears in his belief that survival requires being invisible, countered by his impulse to reach out and be seen. Minor slip: the final epiphany about vulnerability arrives slightly pre-articulated rather than fully discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motive is layered—staying to preserve silence and unspoken words—and the interiority is deeply embodied ("almost laughed, but the sound died behind my teeth, a bee that chose not to sting"). The final confrontation with Mara crystallizes the choice to remain keeper/witness with clear relational cost. Minor: the protagonist's perceptual signature leans heavily on repetition of silence/witnessing metaphors without full contradiction or hierarchy-of-values friction; interior voice occasionally drifts into abstract statement ("texture of our silence") rather than lived perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior life is textured and particular—"the texture of time passing" as desire, the turn to words when numbers fail. Micro-choices (writing garage-sale descriptions, pressing palm to glass) reveal hierarchy of values. The final realization "none of us were living in borrowed time; we were the ones doing the lending" lands as earned insight from accumulated particulars, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. Embodied contradiction is present but could be sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's character is rooted in a consistent perceptual signature—seeing "openings" where others see imperfections—and his micro-choices (lifting the feather to his ear, humming in response to discord) embody that stance under pressure. The embodied emotion is strong ("teeth ache," "flushed") and the final gesture of writing "line after unfinished line" carries visible cost: he accepts incompleteness as companionship rather than solving it. Minor deduction: the bird-being's dialogue edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting Elian's actions alone reveal his arc, and the interiority occasionally leans abstract ("strange country of trust").

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker's interior is distinctly rendered through technical perception filtered by mortality: "clock chiming underwater," choices made through craft idiom ("measuring tension by feel"). Motivation deepens organically from polished architect to dying translator between species, with embodied cost visible in "chest hurt, but his grin came easily." Minor slip: the progression from museum designer to island caretaker feels summarized rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene, and the final death "between them, listening" arrives without a micro-choice that forecloses a path—it reads as graceful fade rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("luminous skeptic" manifests in the tendency to doubt beautifully, to treat sacred routes as question marks), and the resolving stance—standing in the clearing, waiting to see if homecoming begins—reads as earned endurance with palpable cost. Internal contradiction operates: the skeptic chosen for doubt yet sent inward, rebellion coexisting with compliance. However, the piece skews heavily reflective; micro-choices in the present (kneeling to touch footprints, holding up the amber) remain modest gestures rather than decisions that foreclose paths, and the final stance crystallizes options without a visible trade-off that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's interiority is consistently embodied through his ritualized actions and the specificity of his linguistic gift. His motivations are clear and rooted in the botanist's legacy, with micro-choices visible in how he places seeds according to bird calls. Internal contradiction appears subtly in the tension between duty and the acknowledged futility (the reef is already dead), though this could deepen further. The final kneeling gesture and imagined future garden demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost—he continues despite knowing victory will be invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interior voice is concrete and character-particular ("I traded in memories, mending broken record players"), with embodied emotion evident when handling the cylinder and responding to the stranger's grief. The choice to preserve rather than destroy the revelation is motivated by prior causality (the leaf, the trade, Barrow's solidarity) and forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost. Minor slip: the stranger's trembling and tears feel slightly performed rather than contradictory, but the narrator's stance—translating distance into closeness—drives the final decision with genuine restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and specific—his ritual of sketching warped constellations to claim "north enough for me" shows a character-particular stance emerging from pressure. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous fear of and attraction to temporal distortion ("what terrified them had always drawn him"). The micro-choices (crossing the compass line, pressing his palm to the viewport) are embodied and carry visible cost: he becomes the station's "blessed pariah," isolated by his refusal to accept fixed truths. No therapy-speak or label-only emotion; the final stance feels earned by the accumulated particulars of his desert upbringing and caretaker role.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and carries contradictory impulses—swagger masking fear, desire for wonder constrained by cynicism. The central choice to trade away the fear of not returning is earned through the climb's pressure and the king's setup. Emotional embodiment is strong ("chest ache," trembling afterwards) but the final shift leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness ("afraid and still climbing"). Minor: the chivalrous-thief frame remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through specific on-page ethical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's identity as a "crisis actor real crisis survivor" provides strong internal contradiction and motivates the choice to work at the gallery. The walking circuits that spell words demonstrate embodied processing of trauma through concrete action. The custodian's phantom chess games and tea ritual add texture, though his characterization remains somewhat thin. The final choice to "unbind my archive from paper" and write stories into the floor feels earned by the accumulating pressure of the interregnum and the threatened closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with embodied emotion throughout ("ache behind my ribs," "sealed room inside me"). The protagonist's motivation—to excavate buried family language—deepens via contradictory impulses: shame versus longing. The final choice to speak aloud in the abandoned dialect is earned by the stone's cumulative pressure and forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost. Minor: the old woman remains functional but static; her role as gatekeeper doesn't evolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elior's interiority is concrete and character-particular—guilt "wove itself into his fingertips," soothing motion as "small rebellion." Internal conflict between redemptive ego and the wish "to forgive oneself…not excuse them, but live beside them without flinching" is embodied in the winnowing work. The prince's remembered gaze and the woven villagers' accusation charge his present choices. Minor slip: the chess-tutor backstory is densely packed but remains accessible; the final self-forgiveness pivot feels earned by the tapestry work.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Zev's contradictory impulses—haunted eyes paired with a grin, solemnity undercut by mischief—act simultaneously on the page. Maren's progression from rigid justification to startled laughter to harder tears shows embodied emotional contradiction. The micro-choices (her fingers worrying the cloak, the decision to descend carrying prismatic knowledge) carry visible cost. Minor slip: Zev's backstory and role are told rather than earned through present friction, and some interiority leans slightly abstract ("prismatic, aching knowledge").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Corin's uncertainty is signaled early and his interior voice carries distinct texture ("quilts memories together," pressing the charm into the socket). The descent choice feels motivated by accumulated pressure, and the micro-choice to narrate what he sees rather than retreat earns the glass-lung repair. However, the epiphany moment—"understood then that his task was not to prevent destruction, but to conjure meaning"—edges toward thematic summary rather than embodied contradiction, and his fear/desperation registers more as label than as competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter's interiority shows concrete particulars—turpentine on hands, the cobalt shell, the promise kept—and the final act of painting fulfills an arc of endurance. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than tested by on-page friction; the protagonist walks, paints, and leaves without meaningful internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; the introspective texture flattens agency into observation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's internal conflict between pride and genuine care for the sea is embodied through concrete actions—unpacking the vial, pressing her palm to the lens—and her motivation evolves credibly under pressure. The embodied emotion is strong ("screaming tenderness that made her throat ache"), though some interiority edges toward poetic abstraction rather than character-particular thought. Jorah's transformation feels slightly rushed; his fear retreating "from the edges of his eyes" after one scent exposure lacks the resistance expected from someone who "trusted noise, blunt and heavy." The final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost: Mara risks professional standing and Jorah's trust to enact her quieter method.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rian's interiority is vivid and particular—"memories that never belonged to me," the phantom aches of Mara's road—with embodied emotion throughout (brass-bone hand creaking, body remembering gravel). The central choice to lie ("Yes, I lie") and map a route toward "space for ghosts" is earned by the accumulation of loss and the censer foot's charged presence. Minor friction: Mara remains offstage, reducing relational crucible pressure, and the final renunciation feels slightly abstract despite strong sensory grounding. The protagonist's navigation of grief through deliberate cartographic solace carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's involuntary truthfulness shapes micro-choices throughout ("Because I could not lie, I told her..."), and interiority remains concrete with embodied detail ("taste of iron in my mouth"). Risa's chord-hearing is specific and consistently deployed. The partnership work feels earned, though the final transformation ("less haunted and more like a choir") edges toward summary rather than showing a discrete choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interior progression from professional detachment to complicity is earned through concrete micro-choices: stopping three boards away, accepting the keeper's certainty, finally pinning on the boutonniere. The keeper's interiority remains appropriately oblique given his role as catalyst, with his perceptual signature ("softly persistent," the habit of cupping invisible things) consistently embodied. The final choice to take the Edelweiss and wait forecloses investigation in favor of participation, a visible cost. Minor deduction: the stranger's psychology remains abstract, known only through reported gesture, limiting emotional triangulation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is strongly embodied through the tactile handling of the chip and the sensory journey upstream. His eight-year paralysis and final choice to follow the faint path are earned through concrete micro-decisions (following ants, crawling through petals, setting the chip against stone). The "empirically intuitive" trait functions as both perception filter and decision method. Minor weakness: the sister Mara remains abstract, reducing relational pressure, though her absence is thematically intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Isera's motivation to seek the grotto is established through embodied dream sequences and the taste of iron, and her refusal to wait demonstrates character under pressure. Internal contradictions appear in the orchard memory with Ralen, hinting at competing desires. However, the final moment ("Isera remembered") tells rather than dramatizes the pivotal realization, and the change lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path with felt cost on the page. The embodied sensory detail (throat raw, crown on floor, taste of iron) strengthens early beats but the closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio's interior life is richly textured and specific, with contradictory impulses evident in the pull between scientific rigor and romantic metaphor. The reflective passages successfully anchor in present stimuli (the flickering microstar, Kira and Jash's arrival) and tilt stance through micro-choices about how to respond. Secondary characters Kira and Jash apply immediate pressure with their request, though their presence in the remembered scene sometimes reads as观察 more than full dramatization. The final choice to "solve for us, by returning differently" carries conceptual weight, though the visible cost remains slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinctive—"jealous of past selves" and "fog with teeth" fear create embodied contradictions. The closing renunciation ("the only honest tone left") emerges from prior pressure: repeated encounters with graves, each showing different causes. Minor slip: the "feral nostalgia" beat where the double appears feels slightly under-dramatized; the reaction ("ran, naturally") sidesteps the full weight of meeting one's future self. The choice to "walk straight into" timelines at the end is motivated but the cost (what is foreclosed by accepting "jaded wonder") could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's embodied interiority is strong—she inhales "not smelling anything, yet sensing how stories condensed here, drop by drop"—and the client's grief is felt through gesture ("blinking hard"). The parallel loss (her smell, his grandmother) drives the central dynamic. Minor slip: the client's shift from "I do not know how to read pauses" to accepting ambiguity feels slightly compressed, though the screw-placement ritual earns it. Internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure meet the 9+ bar with a hairline gap in the final turn's embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lan's interior is concrete and character-particular, with the crystallized-shard mechanism vividly embodied. His fear-driven clarity shapes his approach to the ceremony, and the final choice—meeting future storms as a scribe bearing luminous scars—is earned by the ritual's transformation. Internal conflict between shame and curiosity is dramatized through two memory shards that drive the rune-writing beats. Minor: the master remains functional rather than deeply individuated, though he applies necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mirabel's interior life is concrete and specific: guilt manifest as physical memory ("dust, ink, and her mistakes"), embodied choices (the perfume bottle as anchor, typing the confession). The contradiction between her past exploitation and present attempt at repair is dramatized through action rather than summary. Her motivation to "stop selling tickets to [Liora's] collapse" shows internal shift with visible cost—she sends a career-damaging confession. Minor slip: the line "You are better at metaphors than apologies" risks meta-commentary but is recovered by the on-page transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    No-One's interiority is consistently abstract and philosophical rather than embodied—he "tastes words like a key made of dust and light" but rarely shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His motivation to unravel cosmic illusions and perform spiral arbitration is articulated through reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final act of weighing histories "wanderingly exact" demonstrates agency, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Diagnostic label-speak ("spiral arbitration," "end of history witness") appears frequently without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shepherd's interior life is vivid and contradictory—he tends mechanisms he "no longer quite believed in" yet pursits a metaphysical question about time's nature through concrete observation. His final choice to turn away from the key is earned by the counting-backwards sequence that reframes his understanding of the clocks' true function. Embodied perception is strong ("the sound he trusted more than any ticking"), and the refusal to use the key forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor: the dreams of "seconds with razor edges" lean slightly toward abstraction without fully grounding their pressure in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory—"theoretically rebellious, the kind of coward who questions rules but obeys them" feels earned. Her final micro-choice to write the response note shows character-specific hierarchy of values (mathematical framing meets emotional risk). Father's hand-twitch during sedation and the lantern-note pilgrimage deepen him beyond the gambler archetype. Minor: the surgeon's "after the heart attack" phrase and some reflective blocks threaten to summarize rather than dramatize, but the ending action forecloses evasion with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and specific—"cultivated estrangement" shapes every choice, from spinning the glass disc to teaching endings how to begin differently. Her motivation to reshape Mara's loop is consistent with her isolation philosophy, and the final moment when she "sat in the tunnel's dim throat, listening as the city's distant circuits hummed with newly rearranged endings" shows earned satisfaction scaled to this length. Minor demerit: Mara remains a voice without embodied contradiction; her shift from loop to liberation feels slightly telescoped, though the stakes and cost remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular—"memory, here, is a matter of weight, not clarity" establishes a concrete stance shaped by grief and ritual. The final choice to "write until the stars came out and the paper finally felt heavy enough" earns closure through accumulative pressure rather than a dramatic pivot, fitting the lens. Embodied emotion appears in anchored details (locket warming "like a second, stubborn heart"), though the apparition sequence risks theatrical externalization. Minor cost: the narrator's stance crystallizes but doesn't meaningfully shift; the work continues unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kenji's motivation (curing loneliness through reciprocity rather than hoarding) is clear and shapes his choice to bring the moon rock to the Exchange. His "desperately jocular" smile and the detail of elbows "gone white from leaning on too many desks" provide embodied specificity. However, his internal experience during the experiment remains largely externalized—we see him "heavier with every truth" but the contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure stay abstract. Mara functions more as facilitator than full character; her decisions don't drive turns so much as frame them.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orrin's interior is richly embodied through the compass warming/cooling and languages flickering "like overlapping maps." The backstory fragments (mother, brother, apprentice) arrive as chords on his nerves and drive the final renunciation ("stay"). The peak choice—kneeling and agreeing to map what lay inside—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the outward search with visible cost. Minor: the apprentice's anger is told rather than shown, and the absorption mechanism remains somewhat abstract, but neither undermines the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently layered—"confidently uncertain" shapes micro-choices (unbending curves, willing the pen to revise) and the final acceptance of death. Embodied emotion appears in the hot pen against ribs and the anomaly's cradle-like pull. Internal conflict is subtly present: the desire to erase versus the pen's refusal to delete. Minor slip: the progression from exile guilt to peaceful acceptance reads slightly too smooth without a complicating reversal in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interior life is richly embodied—her signing practice in pockets, her lip-reading fatigue, her mother's camera as weighted inheritance. The whispering advisor remains thinly sketched (label-only "quietly charismatic," no on-page choices that reveal contradiction or cost), capping the score. Her final laugh harmonizing with silence demonstrates earned shift from isolation to coherent expression, though the advisor's passivity keeps this from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's analytic intuition is established early and shapes the archive exploration, but the critical decision at closure—to stay and translate—feels underearned; the shift from arsonist seeking redemption to patient scribe lacks visible internal friction or cost at the decisive moment. The remorse is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory weaves through present stimuli effectively, yet the final choice reads more as resolution of guilt than a trade-off that forecloses another live option with felt struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific—"nerves into film," "thoughts into relentless projectors"—and the micro-choices (slipping behind the pillar, drumming on the rail) reveal rebellion under pressure. Internal conflict is present: the protagonist is both terrified and drawn to the entangled memories, embodied through the overlapping reflection and the compulsion to drum. However, the realization about the handlers' true purpose arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery, and the final collective action lacks a visible personal cost that forecloses a specific path for this narrator. The embodied contradictions (fear and fascination, individual voice and collective hum) are strong, but the ending leans toward described possibility rather than a choice with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Milo's sensory specificity (identifying people by walks) is well-embodied and drives action. His internal contradiction between calculated preparation and performed spontaneity creates texture, though the final choice feels more engineered than urgent—he laid groundwork weeks ago, reducing present-tense stakes. Interiority remains concrete throughout ("thoughts stacked themselves with surgical precision"), and the embodied coin-palming and key-pressing anchor his physicality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian's interiority shows embodied patience and "spiralingly calm" depth, but much is told rather than enacted through micro-choices. The dentist's motivation is clear—guilt lodged "like broken teeth"—and his final phone call earns modest closure, yet the two-year backstory and the woman's off-page suffering dilute present-tense pressure. Internal conflict remains largely serial (guilt → hesitation → action) rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shutter-tapping and mirror-tilting gestures are vivid, but the dentist's arc relies heavily on reflective summary rather than on-page struggle that forces trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Daniel's interior is consistent and his motivation to "plant forests of second thoughts" is earned through his ability to hear unspoken words. The chess-student collaboration and phone calls embody his method through micro-choices, though the key decision—organizing the window displays—feels more declared than wrestled with under pressure. The embodied cost of his rebellion is present but muted; we see him listening and organizing, but the personal price of this stance remains abstract. The protagonist's internal contradiction (humble rebellion vs. visible act) could have been sharpened in a pivotal beat.

    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her awareness of strain, her barbed words softened at the edges, her detachment from pain as survival strategy. The pirate remains one-note, serving mostly as exposition vehicle. The final realization "she knew her only wish, to find freedom in embracing one's true nature, was the whale's awaiting song" reads as a stated thesis rather than earned embodiment, applying −0.3 for label-speak at closure. Internal contradiction appears in the strain-as-grace thread but never forces a simultaneous choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The performer's contradiction—state amplifier enacting quiet rebellion—is embodied through concrete choices (whittling, narrating). Mara's "bruised numbness" and clamped-down laughter ground her grief in physicality. The final loosening ("like loosening a belt one notch") registers as earned restraint rather than epiphany. Minor: "blank face" repeats without internal texture varying under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and consistent—"the smoke rose like punctuation stripped of meaning" embodies loss through perception. The progression from remembered fear to "tremor of certainty" is earned by the atrium's reopening and his choice to speak subversively rather than gratefully. Internal contradiction surfaces when he brings "no paper, no ink" after receiving an official invitation, revealing his renunciation through micro-choice. The final act—leaving the dais to "stride through boundaries"—forecloses compliance with visible cost, though the cost to relationships or future safety remains implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("innocently cunning heart," painting dreams "whose bubbles and warps finally made sense"). Her choice to take the impossible commission is motivated by prior established traits. The stranger arrives with clear motive and specificity (the warped reed, the plant alphabet). Minor slip: Mira's internal contradiction could be more dramatized in action rather than declared; the final choice feels slightly inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elya's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied doubt ("loosened something in her chest") driving micro-choices. Her shift from leader to co-pilgrim emerges through on-page hesitation and the visitor's honest statement, earning the final stance. Minor deduction: the visitor's paint-splattered boots and swollen eyes function as visual shorthand without deeper contradiction or complexity shaping their choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ela's motivation is specific and embodied through her jewelry-making choices that evolve from "closed eyes" to "glass seeds that caught fractured light." The shift from mourning to pieces "for those who had withered under quiet burdens yet might...remember how to bloom again" traces a coherent arc. Riv as genuinely artificial consciousness is distinct, though his gentle-yet-ardent manner remains largely told. Minor slip: Ela's emotional progression feels smooth where grief-driven work would plausibly generate more contradiction and setback.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and her project is motivated, but her choices feel observational rather than genuinely conflicted under pressure. The invitation to Jonas and her confession arrive without visible internal contradiction or cost that would foreclose a path. The final collaborative mapping reads more as a shared activity than a decision that forces her to sacrifice or transform; the "tired curve of relief" is embodied but the stakes of letting him in remain abstract. Backstory about the grandmother and the project is substantial but anchored to present objects (tape, cards) and does prime the confessional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hiran's motivation is clear and his internal contradiction—between Council doctrine and the need for dangerous knowledge—generates genuine pressure. The choice to open doors in sequence rather than randomly demonstrates character-driven escalation. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("anguished joy," "innocence flake away") rather than embodied contradiction; the final vow feels declared more than earned through micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion through the river-stone bracelet and softly deliberate movement. The final choice to house unbound shadows is earned by prior causality and his regret, though the decision arrives without visible internal contradiction or struggle in the moment. Micro-choices accumulate pressure effectively, and the backstory about his hollowed-out family anchors his present stance without flattening momentum. The Overseer and Lane remain functional rather than fully individuated presences.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's interior contradictions are substantive: the split between clutching evidence of her one good act versus opening her hands to those she hurt operates simultaneously in the vial scene. Her choice to place the tail tip on the wire is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the path of holding her goodness as private proof. Embodied emotion is strong ("counting breaths until dawn"), though some backstory edges into summary rather than micro-choice. The final renunciation carries visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's voice is distinct and her contradictory impulses—closure seeker who reopens wounds—operate simultaneously through embodied choices (reaching for bandage, laughing despite pain). The mentor backstory and trauma-study framing feel purposeful, anchoring her present stance. Plants' distinct voices (ivy's damp rustling, rosemary's kitchen memories) show real differentiation. Minor slip: "displaced miracle" as self-diagnosis reads slightly overarticulated for peak interiority, though it's brief enough not to flatten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's quest is consistently motivated and her interiority carries concrete particulars ("the question had incubated in her since childhood, growing slowly like a secret egg under the ribs"). The spatial imagination trait appears as label-only without constraining an on-page choice with cost. The relationship with the projectionist lacks dynamic pressure; he functions as exposition rather than crucible. Final choice ("let new scenes grow in its light") feels declared rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is specific and embodied—"careful bruise," "ears that heard unspoken words"—and the final choice to "let those trapped ideas spill out" is earned by prior pressure. Motivation flows consistently from inherited ability through terror/longing to surrender. The perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words) remains character-particular throughout. Minor slip: the grandmother's backstory is told rather than dramatically woven, but it primes the closure without flattening present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guard's interiority is concrete and specific—"the clock in my chest keeps punching invisible tickets" grounds motivation in embodied metaphor. Internal contradiction surfaces when he curates phantom schedules for absent trains, knowing arrival is over yet refusing to stop. The final act of singing gaps in the lullaby to sparks shows contradictory impulses (futility vs. persistence) acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the progression from observation to active cultivation feels somewhat linear rather than wrestling with genuine doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is present and anchored in concrete sensory experiences (the sixth sense as "pressure behind the ears," the gear in the pocket). However, the motivations remain largely abstract—"asking one question too many about reality"—and the final choice to place the gear feels inevitable rather than conflicted. The protagonist's journey is more passive observation than active struggle; they follow the forest's invitation without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's flight and choice are rooted in believable fear versus nascent courage, and the metaphor of the broken leash is sustained through micro-choices. However, her interiority leans toward elevated register ("the thin tether between a frightened life and the small, unused courage inside it") rather than embodied specificity under pressure, and the ferry guides remain observational archetypes without a choice that alters the ending. The stairway sequence dramatizes memory as constraint, but the star-stamp passage veers close to symbolic convenience rather than earned psychological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—"nerves knitting," "curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me," ribs "bending like bad questions." Internal contradictions drive the protagonist's arc: sworn silence versus the need to understand cost, obedience versus emerging agency. The final choice to speak ("Enough") is earned by the accumulated realizations on the staircase and forecloses the path of complicity with visible cost (bones shattering, nerves screaming). Minor deduction for the woman's backstory ("I died on your stairs") which introduces complexity but does not fully dramatize her role in the narrator's memory until the wall-touch moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The titan's motivation is internally consistent—caretaker authority expressed through patient archival work—and his agency drives every beat through deliberate message-planting. The scholar's realization at the end embodies genuine collapse ("the graceful collapse of a thought realizing it has stood on air"), satisfying the closure requirement with visible cost. However, the titan's interior remains somewhat opaque; we observe actions but rarely contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The scholar arrives only in the final paragraph, limiting relationship pressure and status dynamics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—tapping rhythms as a decompression ritual anchors embodied memory. The choice to test the pattern on the roof and the climactic moment of "seeing" the vanished sandbar demonstrate internal pressure driving action. Minor slips: the others (Rafi, Lian) remain functional but lack contradictory impulses; their skepticism is told more than shown in choice. The final renunciation (remaining "drifting moored") fits the established stance, though the cost could land more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority shows specificity in her sensory engagement with the stones and deck, and her decision to send the message is earned by the progression from waiting to remembering to acting. The "awkwardly confident" trait appears as label rather than embodied contradiction in simultaneous impulses. Her motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives the arc, but the final choice feels more like crystallization than a path foreclosed with visible cost—she trembles but no competing impulse actively resists on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's telepathic trait is embodied through concrete sensory metaphors ("leaf-thoughts were slow, like dripping resin") and drives key plot choices. Teta Lila's motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" is dramatized through her physical gestures and vocal stance at the bathhouse confrontation. The protagonist's final question to the embryo ("asked it whether it wished to join this troubled, stubborn world") shows agency earned by prior plant-communion work. Minor: the council delegation arrives as stock antagonists without interior contradiction, slightly flattening the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mariam's interiority is concrete and embodied—her trembling hands, muscle-locking freeze responses, and the dense pearl metaphor anchor her trauma without therapy-speak labels. The progression from henna artist to survivor to someone attempting "a pearl of stillness" shows contradictory impulses (reaching for something gone, believing beauty could shield, then renaming resilience). Minor issue: the therapist's voice ("somatic markers") edges toward diagnostic language, though it's framed as his terminology rather than her own thought process. The final choice to fold the photograph into the notebook and walk the clear path earns the stance shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows genuine contradiction—painting people better than touching them, seeking redesign through shadow—and his descent demonstrates agency with cost. The reflective passages anchor in present stimuli (tarot cards, the book, window reflection) and drive micro-choices that tilt his stance. However, the lover's death and client commissions remain abstract; they're told rather than embodied in specific pressure that complicates his choices on the page. The final move toward "possible selves" reads as epiphany without visible friction or foreclosed path in this ending moment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout ("serene anger settle in his pale chest, heavy as cooled glass"), with his motivation—understanding the Crisis Slow—rooted in trauma (mother under falling rock) that drives present action. The tension between his empirical tracker's stance and the elders' divine mercy framework creates genuine internal conflict. Minor weakness: the final choice to "let his sense of self loosen" arrives quickly after the ink demonstration without a fully dramatized internal struggle at that pivot, though prior causality supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ana's interior contradiction is well-embodied: "her hand refuse the command, bravely conflicted" dramatizes the struggle between training and temptation. The choice to preserve and disseminate the letter grows organically from her accumulating doubt about erasure. Micro-choices throughout (checking the alert, opening the capsule, choosing not to burn, threading the network) reveal her values under pressure. The transformation from "archivist and arsonist" to "question passed from hand to hand" earns its cost, though the final self-description edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception ("felt moods in the air, tasted fear in the soil") and her micro-choices are legible—sheathing her talent, repurposing the engraver, choosing pruning over violence. The contradictory impulses (her father's training vs. her pacifism) are dramatized through action rather than summary. However, the final passage offers more atmosphere than a decisive choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the closure reads as resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) but the agency in that moment is diffuse rather than sharply embodied in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fisher's interior life is embodied through his gift (transliterating emotions), and his final choice—refusing to transliterate the goddess's echo—emerges from contradictory impulses acted on the page. The renunciation forecloses the path of always reading others' tides and carries visible cost: he dissolves the question unsaid. Minor slip: the grandmother's whispered technique and his history as "the man who transliterates emotions" are told rather than shown constraining earlier beats, keeping this just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interior is concrete and character-particular (the five-ring calculation, the typesetter's tongue metaphor). Her logic-driven stance crystallizes through micro-choices (opening the velvet drawer, gripping the nib like a gavel) that embody contradiction between inherited guilt and active intervention. The final choice to run the story is earned by the proof-by-contradiction sequence with visible cost (breaking her father's legacy publicly). Tariq functions cleanly as pressure but remains slightly thin; his "devotedly observant" trait is stated more than dramatized in choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's grief over a lost voicemail is embodied through concrete action—fetching the box, connecting cables—and the final choice to play the recording forecloses the path of clinging to spectral echoes with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the recoil versus resolve ("everything in me recoils like tape catching on a bent reel") and the recurring amber talisman objectifies the tension between trapped time and agency. Minor slips: the constellation tattooist profession and baby-cry translation remain ornamental labels that don't constrain any on-page choice, and the brother's characterization stays thin despite carrying thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lark's interior voice is specific and embodied through her artist's perception ("socially perceptive eye, trained on city crowds, now watched the gathered pilgrims as if they were sketches taking shape"). Her motivation to "coax [meaning] out with colors and jokes" generates the climactic decision to draw despite fear. Internal contradiction lands clearly when she realizes "her art was [never] harmless" yet kneels to draw anyway, foregrounding a credible cost. Minor slip: the boy's confession feels slightly mechanical, serving exposition more than his own arc, but it drives Lark's final choice without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Laleh's motivation—empathy without choosing sides—is clear and distinctive, her steel arms a concrete embodiment of that stance. The final choice to open her arms to the city is earned by the naming ritual and tessera sequence. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece asserts her radical gentleness more than it dramatizes internal conflict between competing impulses in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcel's motivation is concrete (encore-seeking, applause as oxygen) and his fractured timeline manifestation is distinctive. Lina's synesthesia provides specific interiority ("old posters fading, all sun-bleached brass and torn velvet blue"), though her micro-choices under pressure remain largely interior assent rather than embodied conflict. The final collaboration choice arrives without visible internal resistance or cost—both characters move toward the same goal without meaningful contradiction between impulse and commitment. The shift from solitary haunting to partnership lacks the friction that would make the choice feel earned rather than offered.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's motivation to map emotional pathways is established, and his interior voice carries weight through embodied sensations ("buzzing," "feather-touch awareness"). However, the final choice to "nudge their paths" arrives without clear prior setup of what that action entails or costs him personally—it reads more as discovery than decision under pressure. Naya functions as affectionate skeptic but her choices remain observational rather than driving pressure; the relationship supports but doesn't crucible-test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iri's interiority is consistently embodied through sensor data and physical interaction with the cave environment. The internal conflict between machine identity and listener role is shown through action ("pressed their palm," "let the sensors…taste") rather than abstract declaration. The final choice to speak aloud and float in the pool is earned by the escalating sensory encounters, though the motivation shift from mapping duty to addressing the unknown feels slightly telescoped. The elm leaf encounter beautifully contradicts professional distance with a less-quantifiable response that charges the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her button-mapping method and her shift from "belief in forecasts" to understanding "shared wisdom" as "courage to let other people's echoes rewrite your own" feels earned. The backstory (~25%) is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the buttons, the warehouse silence) and tilts her stance toward action. Internal contradiction operates: she once trusted the Council yet now steals to "loosen that order," and the final choice to release the echo carries visible cost (ending the containment she worked years to penetrate). Minor: the porters and seamstresses remain off-page influences rather than on-page pressure, limiting relational crucible work.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly characterized through concrete interiority: the pillbox's weight "like a promise," his "prudently daring stubbornness," the embodied habit of watching that "had not yet learned to stop." The final choice to wait rather than rush feels earned by his arc from burned spy to someone seeking where "unused courage waits." Minor slip: Mara's disappearance and the handler dynamics are largely told rather than tested on-page, reducing the felt cost of his current stance. The renunciation of immediate action and shift to patient waiting is visible and character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's interiority is specific and embodied through concrete gestures (touching the needle, waiting three breaths). His motivations are coherent—distilling passengers' burdens—and the mother's whispered plea shows contradictory impulses (keeping vs. releasing). However, the coachman's transformation feels more atmospheric than causal; his choice to hold "past and present...until their meanings thinned" reads as poetic drift rather than a visible micro-choice with cost. Minor: the boy remains more symbol than agent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The potter's interior life is rendered through craft-specific perceptual filters ("vessels shaped in anger rang differently when tapped") and embodied choices under pressure. His micro-decisions—placing clay and seed, circling the oasis—constrain later options and earn the final stance of "gently, sharply" without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in "no self-loathing, only a sharp gentleness" toward alternate selves, showing simultaneous impulses. The ending's Earned Stasis forecloses harsher paths with visible cost (the wasteland beyond might never change) while the potter commits to local kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is rendered through concrete action—threading the tooth, arranging fragments—but her final promise ("keep making small, improbable safeties") edges toward label-speak rather than embodied discovery. The trait "wistfully pragmatic" appears as assertion more than contradiction acting in scene. Embodied emotion is strong in the middle beats (touching the tooth, feeling "foolish and fiercely tender"), and the choice to create the light-scattering installation carries visible cost (exposure, vulnerability made public). Minor deduction for the whispered promise that tells rather than shows the stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interior contradictions are present—the overlap of reincarnation memories creating uncertainty about which self is "true"—and the final choice to "become independent not from the world, but from despair" reflects earned movement. However, the embodiment of emotion remains abstract: "brittle awakenings," "fingers tight on the rail," and the reflection's "brittle awakening of emotion" repeat the same metaphor without physical specificity. The dialogue with the past self risks therapy-speak ("mistook isolation for purity," "choosing connection, not needing it") that flattens urgency at a pivotal beat, though the choice to prepare a harbor and adjust the library's tides does foreclose passivity with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghostwriter protagonist carries a clear interiority rooted in years of absorbing "leftover echoes" from clients' unfinished letters, and the final act of writing the spiral letter crystallizes this accumulated burden into a visible release ("something uncoil inside me"). The contradiction between serving others' voices and seeking the connecting thread for oneself generates authentic internal tension. Micro-choices—spreading fragments, beginning the letter, handing over pages—embody the protagonist's values under pressure. Minor slip: the architect's tremor and loss are stated but not dramatized, slightly weakening the relationship as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven: her decision to "interfere" and the margin rewrites show embodied purpose. Internal contradiction appears ("half joking, half acknowledging her unease") and the final gambit—pouring community fracture into subsonic broadcast—demonstrates agency with visible stakes. Minor weaknesses: the cosmic tricksters remain somewhat abstract, and her emotional progression could degrade more visibly under stress. The final choice forecloses a path (passive observation) with cost legible in the window-rattling swell.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The claustrophobic explorer's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—breath shortening, walls "shivering nearer in imagination," reciting measurements as prayer. Internal contradiction drives pressure: prudent surveyor versus compulsion to descend despite terror. The final choice to descend "accepting the key might change him first" earns the renunciation with visible cost (forsaking open sky, accepting transformation). Minor: the grandmother's voice and archive backstory remain abstract; tightening that anchoring would sharpen motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jonas's prosopagnosia is embodied through his methodical grid-work and his distinct way of "reading" people by motion rather than features (Rhea by heel-dig, shoulder-square). The interiority avoids label-speak and shows contradictory impulses: he paints to "awaken dormant empathy" yet admits "faces failed him" while "gestures never lied." His methodical trait drives on-page choices (mixing paint slowly, organizing blindness into sight) and the final stance—continuing to paint as the stone slips—feels earned. Minor: the secondary goal of mapping compassion through visitor behavior is told more than shown, and Rhea's pressure on him is minimal, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is embodied through her tactile relationship with the copper nail and concrete micro-choices (peeling pages, copying stanzas into the digital log). Her arc from "nervously confident" to purposeful action is earned, with the progression visible in how she handles the journals. The station director remains functional but sketched; the relationship provides light pressure without deepening. Minor: the idealism is stated more than tested under fire, and the "dread...taken on a purpose" line edges toward summary of an internal shift that could have been more fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fiddler's interiority is concrete and embodied through his instrument and the physical weight of the glass flake. His choice to play the second bridge-song is motivated by prior causality (the stranger who pulled him back) and the decision to offer the seat carries visible cost—the collapse of "every possible road" into "the one ahead." Minor: the hitchhiker's bewilderment feels slightly underwritten given the pixelated escape he experienced, though "routed through a detour no one else could see" hints at earned confusion. The protagonist's blindspot (burying gratitude) drives the mistake that necessitates the rescue-song.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular throughout, with embodied contradiction visible in the tension between inheritance and aspiration. The motivational arc—circling back to the train after the investors walk away—feels earned by the established pattern of returning to measure failure. However, the final realization leans slightly abstract ("mistake inheritance for destiny") rather than landing through a final embodied micro-choice with visible cost. Internal conflict operates consistently but the closure moment could carry more physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific ("job titles were the thin armor I wore"), and the contradiction between chronicling others' dreams versus being consumed by one's own creates genuine internal pressure. Aria's dual role as starguard/counselor is established functionally through action. However, the final healing moment ("I finally witnessed my own healing") arrives as declaration rather than embodied consequence, and the protagonist's agency in the closure beat reads passive—understanding arrives to them rather than through a difficult choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen's motivation is clear and consistent—his grief-driven search through the pattern of loss—and his druidic trait of feeling absence is embodied through concrete action (pressing the ice, sending awareness outward in circles). The final whispered reversal "I changed everything" earns the closure through prior causality and forecloses reconciliation with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (guarded yet persistent, grief-locked yet methodical) and plays out in scene. Minor slip: the sister's disappearance is told in backstory rather than shown, which slightly weakens the emotional anchor, but the present-tense search compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The root-bound visionary's interior is specific and embodied—scars glowing, roots drawing blood—grounding the mystical in physical constraint. Lio's skepticism is dramatized through action (bringing the clipping, pressing his scar) rather than told, and his hesitation carries visible weight. The final shared vision sequence maintains distinct perspectives within the link, with Lio's "neatly indexed and carefully doubted" what-ifs contrasting the narrator's root-born speech. The closing stance—"We cannot cut or keep it"—emerges from the shared experience with earned ambiguity, though the transformation feels more conceptual than emotionally wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-specific, driven by guilt over the brother's drowning with embodied emotion ("moth-eaten cloth," the blue scarf memory). Lio's contradictory nature—"fiercely gentle," compassion as dangerous—is shown through action (punching men, humming while performing rituals) and stakes-driven choices. The final shift from "dimmer" Lio to "steadier" narrator earns a credible change through the orchard's price, though the choice to place the hand on the cloth lacks fuller internal conflict in the moment. Minor deduction for the protagonist's relative passivity; Lio drives most decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli's interiority is concrete and embodied—he steadies the table with his knee, recognizes the cabinet curve "with a jolt that bypassed thought." Internal contradiction surfaces when facts desert him and memory floods in, driving the final renunciation. The attribute "confidently uncertain" is declared rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. Reflection density is high (~35% of text) but anchored in the present stimulus (the amp) and tilts his stance toward the final decision, meeting BRR exception criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior life is concrete and consistently rendered through her translator's lens—"analogical thinking" and "kindly methodical patience" shape perception and choice. The guide's vanishing creates genuine uncertainty that drives her final decision, and her "haunted ambitions" conflict visibly with the memory of his surprised inhale. Minor slip: the phrase "haunted ambitions" functions more as elegant labeling than embodied contradiction in peak moments, and the final choice feels slightly under-motivated given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The titan-gear librarian exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—brass-boned, hinge-hearted, filtering the world through archival metaphors—and faces a clear internal conflict between catalog and reverie. The fisherman's fragmented selves create embodied interiority ("brave and fearful, patient and impulsive") that the protagonist must hold simultaneously. The smelting process shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final exchange (reflection-borrowing) demonstrates earned cost. Minor deduction: the fisherman's motivation remains somewhat abstract; his panic is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is rendered through concrete imagery (the pearl's glow, the etched shells) rather than abstract reflection, and her final confession carries embodied hesitation. However, the epiphany "I am afraid we have mistaken survival for living" arrives as articulated insight rather than dramatized contradiction, and the therapy-speak phrasing ("dissolve the walls between hearts") undercuts the otherwise specific perceptual signature. The renunciation of her role as certifier of tombs is signaled but not tested by a visible cost on the page; marking the shelter "provisionally safe" does not foreclose a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—guilt traveling "quieter than any train," touching tape "the way you touch a scar you live with but never accept." Internal conflict operates simultaneously: the narrator claims to be a "truth-seeking river chronicler, not as a penitent" while guilt finds them anyway. The final choice to write the brother's name alongside their own is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of pure self-loathing with visible cost. Minor deduction: the therapy-adjacent phrasing "self-forgiveness...was not a verdict but a map I had refused to draw" in a peak reflective moment borders on diagnostic clarity no one has mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer's interiority is concrete and specific ("cautious exuberance prickling beneath her ribs"), with embodied contradiction between dread and delight. Her final choice to dissolve the resignation letter and commit to restraint rather than documentation feels earned by the library's lesson. Minor weakness: the confidence man remains a static gatekeeper rather than a pressure point, and the protagonist's shift from cartographer-hunger to reverent restraint could show more micro-resistance in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular ("the air tasted annotated," "feeling the plants lean closer"), with embodied contradictions visible in the act of writing doubts in the margins rather than signing. The telepathy-with-plants trait creates pressure without reading as convenient ("the volume hurt," "their metaphors could be florid"), and the final choice—annotation instead of authentication—grows organically from the character's established professional caution and moral discomfort. Minor deduction: the backstory infusion ("Last winter, a mismeasured infusion") arrives as clean exposition rather than dramatized friction, though it does enable present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's interior life is richly embodied through her specialized craft, her trained perceptual habits ("finding patterns in static"), and contradictory impulses when confronting Isren's body. The final choice—placing the emerald chip over his sternum instead of his brow—is a micro-decision rooted in their shared past and her professional method, carrying visible risk (the chip may shatter). Interiority remains concrete and character-particular throughout, though the secondary skyfarers function more as textured backdrop than active pressure. The renunciation at the threshold (leaning close, merging stillness) forecloses certainty with felt cost, satisfying the change requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's journey from caretaker to seeker is grounded in concrete motives—brother's betrayal, years of service, the hairpin dream—and the final renunciation (planting the seed rather than keeping contentment) carries visible cost. Interiority is largely concrete and embodied, though some passages ("kindness had not saved my brother") lean toward summary. The vision sequence showing the protagonist as midwife, soldier, and brother demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slips include declarative emotional labels in reflective beats that could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's professional identity as "conscience for hire" is established through concrete methods (hollow mirror, wind chime translation) and embodied in micro-choices that refuse easy answers. Mara's internal conflict between heroism and self-interest is dramatized through physical gesture ("hugs her arms") and dialogue contradiction, avoiding therapy-speak until the confession "afraid that loving her more than strangers made me a smaller person." The protagonist's agency manifests as strategic withholding of absolution, and the resolution—Mara's shoulder-loosening—reads as earned stasis with visible cost (the unerasable choice remains). Minor templating in gestural beats ("watches," "steps careful") prevents entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with the backwards-aging conceit embodied through layered contradiction ("bones young, eyes impossibly ancient," memory thickening as body erodes). Mora's anticipation and confusion are physicalised through trembling, flexing hands, breath caught. The final choice—to withhold full vanishing until she decides what to remain—emerges from prior causality with visible cost: she has experienced a self-erasure tremor and must now navigate the hollow discovered inside.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and concrete—"weathered resolve settled over him like dust"—and embodied choices accumulate throughout (stone selection, skimming angles, spinal alignment). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the ferryman's historical reverence and his need to adapt ("rivers had dried, and only sound still flowed"), driving micro-choices. The final stance crystallization (understanding his location through stillness) is earned by the accumulated sensory and conceptual work, though the closure moment lacks overt struggle or visible renunciation that would elevate cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orren's interiority is concrete and particular—his failure history drives present choices (unstrapping the harness, following the stair), and the final step into mist feels earned by accumulated pressure. Internal conflict operates through contradictory impulses: fear of falling versus the pull toward mist walking, desire for meaning versus resignation to obsolescence. Minor slip: the epiphany "he wanted to find the sacred in the simple" arrives slightly late and reads closer to a statement than a choice with visible cost in that moment. Embodied emotion is strong throughout (the keystone's warmth, the tilt in his balance), and micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core trait ("hides behind truth") is stated but never dramatized in a scene choice with visible cost. His interiority leans heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("discover the color of sound," "hiding behind truth the way others hid behind lies") that reads more like authorial gloss than embodied thought under pressure. The final vow ("I will no longer hide behind truth") arrives without prior on-page contradiction or failure that would earn the shift; we never see him refuse a question or pay a price for evasion. Embodied emotion is sparse—most beats describe atmosphere or metaphor rather than physical sensation or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and embodied throughout—"metallic chill gather in my palms," "stellar doubt flooded me"—and the final choice to stop casting lots is earned through cumulative pressure. Internal contradiction drives the climax: the cast lots decision maker must choose to stop listening to chance itself. Tamsin's "quietly enthusiastic" demeanor is established through action and stance rather than labels. Minor deduction for the precollapse litany feeling slightly inserted rather than fully earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's interior voice is concrete and consistent: the child's sacrifice charges his present purpose with visible cost ("the memory cut the reaper instead"), and his micro-choices (playing recordings, arranging salt crystals, naming fears) show contradictory impulses—harvesting function versus tender witness. Embodiment is strong ("chest had felt like a hollow instrument") and the final hope for the boy reads earned. Minor slip: the shift from scythe-wielder to cartographer could be more causally linked to the child's sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tamsin's interior contradictions operate in scene: brittle devotion paired with earnest naivete drives her to promise repair despite clear incompetence. The micro-choices (taking the bell, kneeling at the viaduct, speaking to it) embody her flaw—naivete with teeth—and the final act of "letting it ring" forecloses her faith's fragility with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong ("brittle devotion...baked thin and hard by small humiliations"), though the closing image leaves agency slightly abstract. Minor slips: the transition from sensing drip rates to "letting it ring" compresses cause slightly, and the final stance shift could be more viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tomas is embodied through concrete action—removing the wind chime, tightening bolts, following the photograph trail—and his grief and duty create contradictory impulses that press him toward the ending choice. The internal shift from engineer to storyteller is earned by the trail's accumulation and Mara's final image. Minor slip: his "precisely humane attention" reads more as authorial assertion than demonstrated trait under pressure. The ending choice to begin with story rather than warnings forecloses his prior stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian's interiority is vivid and contradictory—cold precision housing sentimental artifacts, equations softening into trust—but the arc from control to surrender feels too smoothly articulated. The shift "letting his chest rise as the flock rose" shows embodied surrender, yet the final transformation reads slightly teleological: the character arrives at harmony without meaningful struggle visible in the peak beat. The lullaby scrap and mother's memory establish contradiction, but they are invoked rather than tested under present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority through the parachute buckle, instrument handling, and grandmother's training. The protagonist's internal conflict between seeing and pointing, anger without aim, and weighing judgment creates genuine tension. Minor slip: "attentively inventive" eyes feels slightly ornamental rather than earned through action. The final choice to file the report carries visible cost in the protagonist's hesitation and the weight metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is dramatized through choices in the memory-duel, particularly the final refusal to erase guilt. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator seeks custody "not to win, but to feel," creating purposeful tension. However, embodied emotion remains thin—"faintest spark of panic, almost like real fear" tells rather than shows the numbness through concrete sensory shutdown. The climactic choice is earned but the emotional texture throughout lacks the contradictory layering required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander's interior is richly particular—"grief like a tuning fork," rehearsing conversations by sweeping leaves into sentences—and his actions (selecting three leaf blowers, pulling cords, conducting) are embodied and goal-driven. The parents' emotional states (not laughed in three winters, pretending not to hear) ground the household grief. The final broken bark "half sob and half giggle" earns the shift through accumulated pressure, though Mara remains more symbol than character. One slip: "mournfully eager" reads diagnostic rather than lived in the opening frame.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's dimensional homesickness and choice to befriend uncertainty anchor clear motivation, and the guardian's distrust-to-approval arc shows earned change. Interiority is consistently voiced through concrete metaphors (garden as thought, margin note identity). However, the protagonist's agency remains largely passive—observing and accepting rather than driving reversals—and the final acceptance of the pendant lacks visible cost or foreclosed options that would elevate the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Corren's characterization is strong through contradiction: hopeless yet determined, stoically sensitive while refusing to "admit it drew any blood." His motivation runs through consistent micro-choices (reaching for the crozier despite heat, murmuring words as "precise hypothesis" rather than prayer). Internal conflict surfaces in embodied moments—"his heart a percussion of doubt under trained indifference"—and the closing choice to redirect blessings toward "unchosen paths" rather than personal gain shows earned values hierarchy. The accumulation of broken experiments and fear-driven abandonments grounds his arc without therapy-speak, though the reflective passages occasionally distance from present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and character-particular ("practical as an accountant of miracles"), with embodied contradictions visible when she navigates the tension between encouraging destruction and protecting the valley. Micro-choices under pressure—placing the shard on her tongue, redirecting the signal toward gradual dismantling—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final compromise (decades-long dissolution vs. catastrophic fall) feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the immediate-collapse path with felt cost. Minor deduction: the miner's complaint launches the journey but never returns to test stakes or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's interior life is established through his record-keeping and seven-hundred-ride obsession, and his choice to hum the melody demonstrates agency under pressure. The woman with the hourglass and other passengers remain largely ornamental, lacking interior contradiction. The final choice—"He chose home"—arrives without visible cost or conflicted impulse, reading more as label than earned decision. Embodied emotion is present ("tingling in his teeth," "knuckles ached") but the climactic moment lacks the contradictory pull that would lift it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete choices (wrapping thread around doorways rather than stepping through) and contradictory impulses (wanting to remember without hurting). Internal states are rendered through physical sensation ("thread warm, faintly pulsing") rather than labels. The architect as secondary character applies immediate pressure through cryptic guidance, though his motivations remain ornamental. The final stance—fastened between possibilities—is earned by the weaving journey, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior is grounded in concrete sensory detail—the chain link against ribs, the ache of steering memory—and interiority shifts credibly under pressure from curiosity to quiet astonishment. Internal contradiction operates when the protagonist chases "unfolded horizons" while teaching rote trench-junction arcs, generating friction that drives the late-night meeting. The final choice to apprentice oneself to edge geometry feels earned by the chain-link framing and the accumulated longing, though the cost (sleep, professional certainty) is implied rather than shown in a micro-action. Embodied emotion is strong; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eren's curiosity is embodied through concrete choices—adjusting dials, cross-referencing the grid, choosing to deliver the message rather than file it. His interior life shows contradiction: protocol versus the "persistently curious ache." The final renunciation of bureaucratic safety to deliver Lale's unsent message carries visible cost. Minor issue: some interiority leans slightly expository ("he reminded himself") rather than staying embedded in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Noah's claustrophobia and need to "stand by the unremembered" create a coherent internal conflict that drives his choices under pressure. The final decision—turning for the exit while the sphere "whispers of return"—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize, cost is felt, but the choice itself remains poised rather than executed on the page. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("claustrophobic panic," "cold water" crawling up his spine), though the therapy-adjacent phrasing "need to stand by the unremembered" and the reflective blocks about forgotten engineers approach but do not cross into diagnostic label-speak. Minor penalty for the slightly elevated register in reflective passages that edges toward philosophical summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's obsessive heartbeat-counting and the way grief manifests as compulsive reconstruction work feel embodied and particular. The moment when he "forget[s] to count heartbeats" during Lian's voice emergence lands as an earned release. However, the final insight—"I realize I have not resurrected her as she was; together we are writing who she will become"—edges toward epiphany without full dramatization of the cost of that acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller is given a clear motive—translating texture into sound—and the final choice to merge his voice with the canyon's dying language shows agency with cost. However, interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than contradictory or embodied; phrases like "quietly articulate even in thought" label rather than enact. The protagonist's micro-choices (pressing the diamond, whispering syllables, accepting the curse) are present but feel predetermined by the concept rather than genuinely conflicted. Emotional progression lacks the irrational layering or self-deception that would elevate character work into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's professional identity as "field liaison for anomalous fauna" provides clear interiority and embodied perception through specific sensory detail ("frostbitten hope," "gravitationally playful spirals"). However, the protagonist remains largely reactive throughout—observing Mara's garden and receiving the phone without making a meaningful choice that forecloses a path. The final line ("Maybe work now was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") reads as an abrupt, under-motivated shift rather than an earned stance crystallization. The lack of a decisive on-page choice or renunciation with visible cost keeps this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation is clear and his choices drive the ending, but his interiority leans toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The key turn—matching his bow to the orchard's pulse—feels more mystical reception than agonized decision. Phrases like "quiet command" and "coaxing rather than shattering" gesture at internal conflict without dramatizing competing impulses in the moment. The final choice to step onto the bough lands cleanly but arrives without visible hesitation or cost that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eren's motivation is clear and embodied through his counting absences and carrying the storm-bottle despite risk. His "respectfully rebellious" stance is shown through concrete gestures (bowing at checkpoints, accepting without questions) though the sister's grave feels like a late explanatory patch rather than earned causality. Mara's agency is thinner—she observes and explains but does not force a choice that costs her. The final exchange crystallizes options but stops short of a decision that forecloses a path with visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli's interior contradiction—seeking "to interpret silence as possibility instead of emptiness" while having "kept his own heart stopped"—is embodied in concrete micro-choices: he sings despite fear, setting the carousel in motion. The emotional arc from silence-as-wall to silence-as-door is earned through the halo's responsive pulses and the room's answering transformation. Interiority remains specific ("a quiet click as an old fear slipped out of place"), avoiding therapy-speak labels. The final choice to "set to work" forecloses passivity with visible cost: he commits to building rather than salvaging.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mariel's interiority is specific and voice-consistent ("sanely eccentric, which meant her strangeness had methods, catalog numbers, and circulation policies"), and her motivation to find "the place where stories live" drives the nocturnal mapping project. The poet's hesitation at the junction provides embodied tension, but his interior remains opaque—he functions more as observed catalyst than co-protagonist. The final realization ("stories lived wherever someone stood like that") feels partially earned by the scaffolding of star-marked pauses, yet the leap from geometric diagrams to "posture of attention" compresses causality; the insight arrives more by authorial assertion than inevitable discovery. Minor: "fondness" and observational distance flatten potential friction when a choice-point (whether to follow, whether to speak) could have sharpened agency.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Irena's interior life is richly textured through concrete perceptions ("syllables of breathing," "luminous absence"), and her motivation—seeking the vanished presence—drives the arc with embodied longing. However, the final act lacks a meaningful on-page choice or renunciation; the sunrise "poured through her" without visible agency or cost that forecloses a path. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary of past states rather than dramatized micro-choices under present pressure, flattening some urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and embodied—the glass vial grows heavier with unfinished thoughts, the fear is "a clenched fist." The core choice to thank fear and ask it to step aside is motivated by the vial-uncorking pressure, but the micro-choices leading there feel somewhat telescoped; the protagonist's agency compresses into a single reflective move rather than a sequence of contradictory impulses acting in scene. The locksmith remains atmospheric and enigmatic without decisive on-page choices that constrain the protagonist's path. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the final beat's gentleness risks softening the visible cost required for the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"curiosity cost me my own memories" creates a credible central wound. The choice to kneel and recover memories despite knowing "something else frayed" demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously with visible cost. The brother revelation lands with earned surprise, rooted in prior causality. Minor dip: the students' complaint about tangents feels like externalized self-awareness rather than organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rhea's internal contradictions shine: "combative tenderness barbed with fury," refusing to let fear be final, promising that forgetting will hurt. The walking-backwards nervous tic is deployed once with visible embodiment. Jun's defiance wrapped in fear reads authentic, though their arc compresses slightly. Minor slip: "theatrical reluctance" edges toward summary rather than dramatized resistance in the tea-reading beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior progression from gray hopelessness to planting hope is tracked through embodied moments (trembling hands, pooling colors), but the transformation arrives too smoothly without genuine internal friction. Lior functions primarily as wise guide without contradiction or limit; his consistent patience never costs him anything on the page. The piece shows micro-choices (reaching out despite fear) but the narrator's shift from "hope had felt like a luxury I could no longer afford" to imagining murals and rainbows lacks intermediate resistance or a visible tradeoff that would make the final stance feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilan's internal world is grounded through embodied detail—the net's history "thrums," voices "curl around his wrists like damp fingers"—and his motivation to restore masks and names is earned through the backstory of his brother's loss. The micro-choice at each knot ("I will keep it only across sharing a secret") shows a hierarchy of values, and his final understanding that masks will "fit more gently" registers a credible internal shift. Minor deduction: the restless spirits remain abstract presences rather than individuated pressures, and the brother's absence is told rather than dramatized in a choice that alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—his "guardedness flex[ing], a kind of shielded openness" embodied through micro-choices like measuring twice and "lay[ing] awake wondering what lived inside the millimeter." The woman in the wool cap is vivid in her silent gesture (fingers to lips, shaking her head), and her aged reprise adds weight. The final choice to reopen "only as a place to listen" feels earned by the pattern of his interrogation of absences, though the lack of visible cost at closure (no foreclosed path, no trade-off) keeps this from the high band. Minor slip: Mara's trust in his "empathy" is told rather than dramatized through prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinctly rendered—"quietly analytic, the sort of person who measures panic in heartbeats per minute and grief in the weight of unspoken words"—and the physicist's letter creates genuine mirroring pressure. The final choice carries visible cost: salvaging everything would "smother the very uncertainty" the physicist entrusted to the sea, yet leaving it all risks incompleteness. Minor slip: the skeleton's "mid-sentence" jaw and the narrator's parallel obsession feel slightly over-articulated, nudging toward thematic convenience rather than fully embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation is clear and his interior state is concrete ("throat tight," "something inside him tighten like a drawn bow"), but his agency arrives late—he observes the wall's transformation for most of the story and only makes a decisive choice near the end ("Use me"). The secondary characters (baker, child, engineer) are impressionistic sketches rather than on-page presences who apply pressure. Internal contradiction is present (shyness vs. desire to be heard) but the final choice feels more like acceptance than a struggle with competing impulses, reducing the cost's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Etta's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with her curiosity functioning as both strength and burden. Her motivation to "seek out the joy beneath anguish" drives her theft of the maintenance key and shapes her perception throughout. The final shift—carrying the diary's "method" rather than the object—demonstrates earned internal change. Minor weakness: the "affectionate detachment" toward nobles could be more embodied through contradictory impulses in a specific beat rather than stated as a quality she "hardly understood."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and specific, filtered through her professional lens of meteorology applied to grief and memory. Her choices—volunteering to drift, creating emotional cloud taxonomy, documenting atmospheric memory—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The decision to "let the broken space carry her" at the end is earned by the accumulating evidence and her shift from proving to accepting. Minor slip: the final realization feels slightly over-articulated for someone mid-experience, though it stops short of therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's prosopagnosia is embodied through concrete navigation strategies (books by spine and smell, constellation analogy) and drives her relationship to the library as "her only true home." The final realization—that frames and limits force attention rather than obstruct it—emerges from her painting constraint and ties to her disability with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her attempt to compress "decades of light into pages" while confronting the impossibility of endless sky. Minor deduction: the patron's coin-teaching backstory is told rather than dramatized, though it primes the safe discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's interiority is concrete and particular ("collected rumors like stamps"), with embodied curiosity driving micro-choices throughout. The decision to chart stranded luminance is well-motivated by the mother's legacy, though the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract. Internal conflict between scientific caution and personal discovery operates consistently, with the final choice emerging organically from accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the mother's voice functions more as backstory decoration than active constraint on present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly textured through perceptual signature ("silence here was not empty; it was layered") and embodied reactions (chapped fingers, stinging eyes). The motivation to repair what "had broken so quietly" is poetic but remains abstract—no concrete personal stake or contradictory impulse forces a genuine choice under pressure. The arc from arrival to thawing is more lyric accumulation than character transformation with visible cost; the locksmith observes and enacts repair but never risks or forfeits a specific personal option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kerran's altruistic ghost persona is consistent and embodied through chalk-writing that "stung spectral fingers," anchoring motivation in both life (river cleanup) and death (organizing evacuation). The protagonist's agency drives key choices—meeting召 召唤, route planning, timed instructions—with visible cost when the bell cracks and the final image shows gratitude "tangle with grief." Internal contradiction appears when Kerran recalls drowning in hospital light believing the campaign failed, yet now sees people "ready to move whole groves if a ghost asked kindly enough." Minor slip: Mara's trust declaration feels slightly on-the-nose ("feels strangely trustworthy") rather than dramatized through action, though it does unlock Kerran's memory and forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The adjuster's motivation is grounded in loss and the broken puppet provides a concrete emotional anchor, but the interiority often drifts into elevated, abstract phrasing ("bruised awe at the vastness") rather than embodied contradiction. The core choice—substituting the puppet head for the master key—feels thematically resonant but arrives without visible internal conflict or a dramatized micro-choice that narrows options. The child's ash and the woman's forgiveness are told through nested-pattern chambers rather than felt as lived memory that tilts present stance. Agency registers as renunciation with cost, but the path to that renunciation lacks on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—"listening to the sea grind the cliff below," the nut that "burned like a coal." Contradiction shows in the tension between wanting to send travelers away and choosing to guide them, plus the final realization that guiding this last traveler "might finally free the orchard from me." The curse's obligation versus the desire for release drives escalating choices with visible cost: each guidance defies the blueprint and leaves "dead maze" frost traces. Minor issue: some reflective passages ("My curse was not the orchard itself but the obligation…") veer close to summarizing insight rather than dramatizing it, but they anchor in present perception and tilt stance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interior is specific and embodied: grief that "narrowed everything to a single note," foam spirals triggering memory of Leo laughing. The turn from seeking forgiveness to inviting Leo's absent judgment into each decision is earned, and the final prototype passing stress tests delivers visible relief rather than triumph. Minor slip: the chrysalis moment ("something in the husk mirrored her new polymers") edges toward convenient symbolic alignment without enough dramatized friction beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor's motivation is coherent—awakening with the desire to find where stories begin—and interior moments show contradiction ("instructions sat in his mind like unshelved books… never quite aligning into trust"). The woman's fatigue of "too many identities" and desire for "silence before the opening word" are established but somewhat abstract. The shared moment viewing carved absences earns the final choice, though the vendor's arc from "blank" to "margin" feels more conceptual than embodied. Minor: "mindfully scattered" appears as a descriptor without constraining on-page action with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rafi's interior life is concretely embodied through his cautious choreography ("hands tucked into his sleeves"), sensory filtering (taste as memory-reading), and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values (deciding which shards to use, sealing the soldier's massacre deeper). His motivations remain consistent—filing memories down to bearable textures—and the final image shows earned endurance with visible cost: he lies down still tasting the day's sorrow, the fortress cycling back to uneasy sleep. Internal contradiction appears in his simultaneous need to taste pain and his bracing against subsumption, creating authentic tension. Minor deduction: the woman's apology and the soldier's massacre are felt through Rafi but don't force a higher-stakes choice that meaningfully alters his approach within the story window.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is established through her "harmonious choral librarian" role and her decisiveness, but her choices under pressure feel more competent than conflicted. The piece tells us she's "empathetically decisive even when trembling" yet her actions proceed smoothly without visible internal contradiction or cost-laden hesitation. The elevator gains more embodied emotion ("rust aches to let things flow") than Mara herself, whose profession-driven lens remains consistent but doesn't visibly narrow or struggle. Secondary characters (the choir) appear only to validate and execute, applying no meaningful friction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio's interior is densely rendered with embodied contradictions ("chaotically precise," "spiraling in double helices"), and the final choice to become archive rather than cataloger is earned through prior causality. The neural-filament integration and acceptance of entangled memories forge a credible transformation with visible cost—tears from "the weight of finally belonging." However, the leap from instinct to "surrender into complexity" reads slightly abstract at the pivot; one more micro-choice showing him resist then release control would sharpen the turn. Interiority remains concrete throughout, avoiding label-speak even under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is coherent—his "prism-minded" training and pursuit of forbidden combinations drive him forward—but interiority leans heavily on exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Embodied emotion appears ("racing pulse," "prickle on his skin"), yet peak moments describe the archivist's thoughts more than force live micro-choices between competing desires. The chains' "assessing" and his "tempered fire of curiosity" read as told qualities rather than dramatized struggle. No on-page secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motives are consistent—his drive to create music in silence is embodied through concrete actions (threading copper, shaping living instruments). Interior texture is present but relies on filtered perception ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes") that dulls immediacy at key moments. Ina's embodied reaction (gasping silently, feeling vibrations) adds specificity, but the final realization ("knows he has finally created music") edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction. The grove's unified motion and Lio's exhausted collapse provide visible cost, lifting the ending above convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Oren's interiority is concrete and his motives—seeking the eclipsed covenant to achieve closure for his exile—intensify through the nexus scene. The boy's memory and the worry stone ground embodied emotion ("fragile lamp," dent matching his thumb), and the final choice to reshape the covenant's terms arises from established values with visible cost: he forgoes absolution for a repositioned stance. Minor weakness: the internal conflict between condemnation and absolution could have been dramatized through a micro-choice earlier in the sequence to deepen contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's pacifist stance is embodied through consistent micro-choices (refusing to break the clasp, his instruments cobbled without violence), and the final decision to unclasp the diary is earned by the realization about empathy born from prior reflection and sound-work. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("digging toward the hidden springs of patience under his temper"). The backstory regarding Mira and his shout is substantial (~20% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (the diary, the fireworks countdown) and tilts his present stance via the micro-choice to finally open the journal. Minor deduction: the epiphany about "feeling how the world pressed her there" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization, though it remains tied to embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's character is rooted in a vivid sensory gift (olfactory navigation), embodied emotion ("salt of fear," "metal tang"), and contradictory impulses—her hunger to transform death into life and her anxiety around stillness. Her final choice to plant the seed is earned by her articulated philosophy ("death blooms among us, perhaps we will…hear the undercurrent of wisdom"), and the piece tracks her micro-choices: bargaining for the seed, journaling scents, and arguing before elders. Interiority is concrete ("mind darted like swifts") and no therapy-speak appears in peak beats. Minor slip: grandmother's wisdom arrives via reflection and does not constrain a present choice on the page; per BRR it primes the closure but does not alter a mid-story option, so no large deduction applies, yet it slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority is strongly embodied through sensory particulars ("steered by fingertips on bark, by wind on eyelids") and the micro-choices under pressure during the inversion hour show commitment. However, the protagonist's agency is largely observational until the final beat; the discovery moment at the arrow lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path—he reaches out, learns the answer, and the piece ends without showing what he gives up or how this knowledge alters his stance. The memory-vibration sequence ("his first flight, his sister laughing…the moment his home moon cracked") layers emotion concretely, but the closure does not dramatize a meaningful change or endurance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator's interiority is concrete and professional, anchored in embodied habit (thumbing the patch, walking the routes). Internal contradiction emerges through the tension between protocol and experience, and micro-choices (clipping sensors, sketching arrows) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance—"enough to know that foresight could be trained"—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the flight engineer's death, the frayed patch). One slip: the investigator's expertise is declared more than tested under genuine struggle; most moves feel competent without meaningful friction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilen's interiority is rendered through embodied synesthetic perception ("sound arrived to him as color") and his task is clear, but his agency operates in anticipation rather than active choice until the final beat. The moment of release ("released his waiting finger") functions as decision, yet the preceding material reads more observational than conflicted. Internal contradiction is minimal; the story prioritizes atmospheric specificity over psychological friction. No other characters appear on the page, so relationship dynamics are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in failure and driven by the need to understand rather than succeed. His contradictory impulses—duty versus conversation, performance versus genuine inquiry—act simultaneously in the amphitheater scene. The final choice to "offer a sound to whatever listened" rather than command the flute is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the foreclosure of his guardian identity). Minor deduction: the boy's death is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the weight of Cael's failure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's desire to learn "the mathematics of emotion" drives choices across the piece, and interiority is embodied through concrete sensation ("chest tightened," "taste the iron"). Mara's trait of borrowing personalities is vivid and consistently enacted through speech and posture. The final stance shift—"the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief"—is earned by the transposed empathy sequence, forecloses the old framework with visible cost, and feels character-rooted. Minor: Mara remains slightly opaque in motivation; we see her actions but not the contradictory impulse beneath them.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courier's jitteriness is embodied through boot rhythm and fidgeting hands rather than label-only; his attachment to the pendant and Ralen's memory provides clear internal contradiction. The final choice to "stay a little longer everywhere" emerges credibly from the sympathetic vibration experience, foreclosing the rushed occupational mode with visible cost to efficiency. Minor: the shift from occupational jitter to kneeling reverence could use one more micro-choice showing resistance before surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct and internally consistent—"attentive mystic" who communes with objects—and the hierarchy of values (curiosity, honesty, proof) shapes micro-choices at the frost reading and door-to-door visits. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("the quarry never sent me into town for nothing"), and the final stance (telling "truthful lies") emerges from prior pressure. Embodiment is strong in sensory action (pressing palm to quartz, angling prism), though the closing renunciation—accepting that belief cannot be proven scientifically—could foreclose a live option more visibly to reach the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nari's motivation is concrete and her interiority is character-particular throughout, especially in the pivot where she understands the puzzle as "a loom turned sideways." The decision to sacrifice her tapestry is embodied through the physical act of unweaving and earns the closure cost. Minor issue: the elder's declaration and mother's mourning are told-only backstory rather than dramatized pressure in the present scene. Emotional progression remains credible; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Corren's motivation is clear and consistent—coaxing resilience from rubble through listening and physical effort—and his micro-choices (descending into mines, using the silk, speaking to stone) show agency under pressure. His internal life is embodied through "storing their hopes like hot coals" and the physical sensation of force "knotting through his bones." The final act of reshaping stone with the silk is earned by prior accumulation, though the interiority remains somewhat distant and the change feels more situational than deeply internal. Minor deduction: the "meek...shoulders curled inward" setup is underplayed in later beats; his agency reads stronger than the initial framing promises.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's internal contradiction between mapping for others versus mapping themselves is embodied through the cyclical pattern and the shard-choice. The sensory-mapper trait is specific and shapes perception, though the talent's "seasons of dull, ordinary sight" never constrains an on-page choice. Interiority leans abstract ("dense star bending every decision") and the final shift feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path. The Archivist remains functional but one-note, existing mainly to deliver exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is characterized through specific embodied habits—"steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology," "warmly observant eyes cataloged every creak"—and his internal contradictions are visible: he "did not believe in ghosts" yet his fingers tremble and he rearranges stones. The decision to write the letter and alter the stone message is earned by his accumulated loneliness and the pull of the anonymous chain. Minor slip: the interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("luminescent ache," "painful urge") without full embodiment, but the final choice forecloses his shadow status with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orrin's interiority is concrete and specific—his "accidentally prophetic" trait shapes past and present choices with embodied examples (clouds streaming ads, sea remembering streets). The final choice to "tilt hoarded shadows into the waiting sky" emerges from decades of tending and a forgotten oath, creating earned agency. Internal contradiction appears in his "shadowed elation" and the laughter that "snagged on something sharp," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the backstory weight (~25%) occasionally pauses present pressure, though it anchors the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's motivation is clear and specific—he wants to understand story magnetism—and his new heart provides embodied internal conflict ("quietly explosive...testing how much wonder the ribs could hold"). The three patrons offer distinct voices and micro-portraits that reveal character through compressed particulars. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; his realization in the penultimate paragraph is told rather than enacted through a difficult choice with visible cost, and the final bow reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo's interiority is concretely embodied through action—kneeling, touching the cold metal, speaking to trees. His motivation to understand what trees witness moves from wondering to earned action when he points the sextant at the sapling. The final choice to record witnessed sorrow is causally earned through the night's progression. Minor drag from the long reflective museum-object passage mid-story, but it anchors present action and the final recording choice closes with visible cost (his isolation deepened, but his understanding gained).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is vivid and embodied—"her satchel whispering with shards" and the final weight vanishing are concrete moments. However, her decision to sing the memories back lacks visible internal conflict; the tug between mercy and restoration is told in backstory rather than dramatized as a contradictory impulse in scene. The ending change feels inevitable from her role rather than earned by on-page struggle. Minor penalty for the absence of a micro-choice that tests her against her own oath before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal landscape is anchored in concrete regret (brother's death, saved voicemail) and his nightly ritual shows embodied contradiction—staying while leaving. The epiphany in the secret library ("the truth was simpler and heavier") reads earned through the triggered memory, and his micro-choice to keep the invitation as "promise" rather than "secret" forecloses his old pattern. However, the therapy-adjacent language ("understand the contour of your refusal") and the clean pivot from tears to resolution compress grief without sustained friction, and Mara functions primarily as exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's temperament as a "creeping normality noticer" is embodied through concrete observation and micro-choices (keeping the bread, bringing it to the tea house, unwrapping it). His motivation to find absolution crystallizes in the confession "I thought I would eat it when I forgave myself for not protesting," and the final stance shift—"no absolution, only a slight adjustment in his posture"—feels earned. The tea mistress functions as crucible and mirror, her observations applying pressure without easy comfort. Minor: the interiority occasionally edges toward articulate self-diagnosis ("Is noticing anything more than an excuse"), but the embodied action and contradictory impulses (waiting for purpose versus waste) keep it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Serin's interiority is richly embodied through frost-prickle calibration cuffs and breath crystallizing, and his contradictory motives—official obligation versus private desire for meaning—act simultaneously in the peak beat. The founders' confession of loneliness reweights his "carefully layered detachment" into recognition of shared fear. His final choice to braid his vow through theirs is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of merely stabilizing without change. Minor deduction: the founders remain faceless smears; a second on-page character applying immediate pressure could have sharpened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Loretta's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with clear motivation rooted in her moonshine-running past. Her micro-choices—"curiously steadfast calm," choosing which betrayal to ask, deciding to stay "until sunrise"—reveal hierarchy of values. The embodied emotion when she "staggered, clutching the fob as if it burned, yet the pain came clean" avoids label-speak and grounds the revelation in physical response. Minor deduction for the father remaining off-page; his presence would have sharpened the stakes, but the memory-work through the fob compensates adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The luminous skeptic carries a consistent perceptual signature (taste-based sensing, bioluminescent doubt) and makes a micro-choice at the end by answering "without words." However, the final choice feels more received than wrestled-with; the protagonist is largely observational until the closing moment. The weather-bearers deliver their exposition cleanly, but their interiority remains opaque. Internal contradiction is minimal; the arc from doubt-as-wall to doubt-as-lens is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concretely embodied through charcoal dust and mnemonic recall, and his contradictory impulses—vowing never to finish versus needing to rectify—drive the cave descent. The final renunciation (rehanging the portrait and locking it away) forecloses a path with felt cost. However, the epiphany "Inescapable callings do not end…when you stop trying to lock them away" reads as diagnostic label-speak that over-articulates the thematic insight, weakening the earned quality of the turn. Mara remains a catalyst more than a on-page pressure; her absence means the relationship crucible operates entirely in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's trait of wilting near dishonesty provides a distinct perceptual signature and motivates his journey, but the embodied emotion at pivotal beats relies on stock phrasing ("slid under his ribs and caught there," "throat constrict"). Internal contradiction is present—his reverence for honesty versus the city's suppression—but the final choice to step inside reads as discovery rather than a renunciation with visible cost. The piece remains in mid-band because the protagonist's agency at closure is more observational than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interior texture is strong and embodied through his seasonal muteness and the physical work with metal and sound. His choice to install the iceberg shard at the tower's apex reads as motivated by his ethos, yet we see few contradictory impulses in scene—he proceeds smoothly from receiving the shard to tuning without visible cost or hesitation. The girl's silent presence supplies external pressure, but her motivations remain abstract; she functions as catalyst rather than agent. Lio's winter muteness constrains speech but does not visibly complicate his peak choice or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android's interiority is concrete and specific—"sand in circuits," "prayer flags across the edge of consciousness"—with embodied tension between programmed duty and accumulated nightmare imagery. The compression sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously: he opens the crate knowing it will flood him with terror, yet folds the images down rather than resisting. The final choice to seal the crate carries visible cost: "faint afterimages of the children remained, softened around the edges," foreclosing the pristine early-farm nostalgia. Minor slip: the motivation loop around "miniaturize" and "compress" feels slightly ornamental in the middle third, but the closure choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (curating, hosting circles, tracing others' steps), and her core trait of "leading through following" shapes her approach throughout. However, the character remains idealized—her listening practice never backfires, no neighbor resents her intervention, and her certainty that "this was not inventory; it was invitation" reads as convenient authorial knowledge rather than earned inference. The collective resolution dilutes individual agency; Mara becomes a conduit rather than a character making costly choices under contradictory pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concretely anchored through sensory detail ("water lapped at my calves as if reading Braille from my skin") and the relationship with Dr. Ara Quinn drives meaningful pressure. However, the final choice to "liberate her work into the world above" arrives without visible cost on the page—we see the protagonist adding notes and teaching servers a new rhythm, but no dramatized price paid or path foreclosed. The motivation is clear and the emotional register specific, but the stakes crystallization at closure lacks the felt consequence required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and specific—reading gravity through failing lanterns and salt crystals—with concrete embodied detail ("breath slowing as though my chest had been filled with wet sand"). Internal contradiction surfaces between the narrator's earlier dismissal of the father's omens and the later embrace of the same divination logic, driving the final choice to brew coffee and read the grounds. The ending earns a stance-crystallization (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) when the narrator commits to exhuming memories through the father's apparatus. Minor slip: the whale's agency as "watching" feels slightly attributive rather than fully dramatized pressure on the narrator's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilen's interior is concrete and consistent—the "tranquil blaze" metaphor gives texture to his resolve without label-speak. His micro-choices (placing the crane, shaping breath, choosing this valley) emerge from established motive and culminate in a renunciation with visible cost: "each erasure as a weight added to his bones." The stance shift from preparation to completion is earned. Minor: secondary characters are absent, so relational pressure is untested; the protagonist's competence could face one more visceral obstacle to deepen contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("some old etiquette manual had opened in my spine"), with embodied emotion that avoids label-speak. Internal contradiction emerges clearly: the protagonist insists on sugar while both parties recognize "the first of many agreed upon lies." The final choice to "carry their denials as gently as their truths" represents earned endurance with visible cost, though the choice feels more intellectual than viscerally tested. Motivation to learn the building's language is sustained and shapes weekly sessions, but the stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than urgently personal.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Neris's skepticism and evolving stance are clearly motivated, and her guilt over her brother's isolation is embodied through specific memory fragments. The caretaker remains somewhat functional rather than fully individuated—his role as exposition vehicle occasionally flattens his presence. The transformation from "skeptic stalking the borders of belief" to someone learning "to listen without running" is earned by the seashell vision and the caretaker's guided instruction, with visible cost in her confrontation with archived guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Irian's internal conflict between duty and mercy is embodied through the concrete act of forging, with the rose thorn functioning as a tactile anchor to his mother's unfinished letter. The motivation to "forgive the unfinished" drives the final choice to sign in his own hand, creating a visible cost (exposure of all prior forgeries). Sevran's arrival adds pressure, though his quick pivot to enabler slightly reduces antagonistic weight. The final renunciation—signing as himself rather than the king—is earned and forecloses the forger's shadow-identity with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's interiority is consistently grounded in embodied grief—the broken shell, the act of listening, the choice to accept rather than force the canyon's answer. Her motivation is concrete and her final realization (the canyon keeps what remains, she must teach the living) is earned by the progressive revelations. Minor deduction: some emotional processing reads slightly over-articulated ("grief sharpened within her, clean as the night air, yet some part of her loosened") and at the climax the shift feels slightly summarized rather than acted.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's interiority shows concrete detail ("pressure in his chest," touching the snow globe), and his stance as truth-weaver is enacted through his careful word choice with the woman. The woman's shift from defensive to crying is grounded in the weight of the revelation. However, the sister's backstory and the extended dream-window mechanism rely heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under present pressure, and the woman's final emotional turn arrives without visible internal resistance or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific, tracking the knot of insult and the brightening chest moment without therapy-speak. Internal conflict between doubt and desire for validation drives micro-choices (asking the question, trying the droplet throw). The brother's insult functions as embodied pressure rather than mere backstory, and the final easing inside the narrator reads as earned by the parapet lesson. Ren's character is richly particular but his choices don't alter the scene's outcome—he demonstrates rather than decides under pressure—limiting the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theo's interiority is concrete and professional—his debunker lens colors every observation. The stakes drive him from verification to moral calculus, embodied in "the hairs along his neck rose, registering a pattern his rational mind had not yet parsed." The final choice to withhold the diamond is earned by prior causality, though his internal contradiction (dismantling fantasies vs. meeting a real cabal) could press harder in the final beat. Minor: the phrase "devotional" leans slightly abstract for this POV under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ilen's interiority is vivid and character-particular throughout ("gritty whimsy had always been his last defense against sincerity"), with embodied contradiction evident in his simultaneous attraction to and fear of the voice. The childhood flashlight memory anchors his current stance without pausing pressure, and his final choice to stand beneath the portico emerges from established traits with visible cost—he forecloses safe refusal. Minor deduction: the voice's threat about "worse at metaphors" leans slightly comedic in a way that undercuts the weight of the bargain, and Ilen's agency at closure feels more passive acceptance than active decision.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's interiority is richly embodied through selective perception (measuring morning's worth in sound, listening the way tides listen to moons) and his core contradiction—isolation versus bridge-building—drives the final choice to step toward town. The woman's arrival and shared confession provide genuine pressure that alters his stance from solitary bottler to active translator. Minor slips: "positively wistful courage" reads label-like rather than enacted, and the woman's backstory ("war, hunger, stolen dances") compresses into summary rather than dramatized detail. The ending choice to carry jars toward translation forecloses the pure isolation path with visible cost (leaving the loft, spending reserves), satisfying the closure test.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias exhibits a clear trait ("logically emotional") enacted through concrete choices: categorizing the wrong sound, climbing with measured steps, assembling the problem like a circuit diagram. His interiority is character-particular ("making flowcharts for feelings"), and the final action—matching the artifact's pitch through sonic absolution—grows organically from his training and personality. The renunciation implicit in exhaling "into the arriving dark" carries visible cost (isolation, responsibility), though the protagonist's flaws remain understated and his internal conflict could be sharper to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and body-anchored ("impatience gnawed at my ribs"), with clear micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears effectively in the conflict between urgency and enforced patience. However, the transformation at the viaduct basin feels somewhat asserted rather than fully earned through prior micro-decisions; the leap from frustration to understanding could use one more intermediate choice. Orren remains functional but flat, never applying pressure that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is embodied through concrete sensory overlaps ("memories I had never lived," overlapping apparitions) and micro-choices (clipboard as shield, the final nod and murmur). The controlling influence manifests through supervisor's voice and policy constraints, creating genuine friction. The investigator's transformation from compliance to witnessing is earned by accumulated pressure, though the final renunciation remains more stated intention than decisive on-page action with visible cost. Interiority leans slightly toward label-speak ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories") but remains largely grounded in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is motivated by a complex interior conflict—his flinch away from decision haunts him—and his micro-choices (bringing the heart to Mara, articulating his doubt) are embodied and specific. The renunciation he contemplates (standing beside forgiveness vs. locking Jonah in place) feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor deduction: Jonah's trembling hands and twenty-year replay are told rather than dramatized, reducing the weight of the backstory's pressure on the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orin's motivations—seeking what makes machines want—anchor the opening and his final decision to "point myself at whatever comes next" emerges from accumulated curiosity rather than sudden epiphany. The moment he touches the arrow tip and feels the "faraway bell whose sound had not quite been invented" embodies yearning concretely. However, his interior life remains largely descriptive; the moment he realizes "his arrivals here were his own triumphs, not the Algorithm tugging his trajectory like a leash" stings but doesn't force a visible micro-choice that alters his stance before the launch. The cost of accepting the Algorithm's manipulation is told rather than dramatized through a forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is distinctive and specific (the "stone in my shoe" metaphor for not-knowing, the patch as worry stone), and motivation intensifies across the piece from passive observation to active transgression. Internal conflict between professional duty and personal obsession drives micro-choices (spoofing the audit, treating silence as content). The final decision to close the interface after discovering the subnet feels earned but lacks visible on-page cost in the moment—the price is more implied than embodied, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira's "calmly intuitive" training is dramatized through the mirror-reading method and the decision to reconstitute rather than enforce the accord. The anomaly's contradiction—stubbornness wrapped in fear—comes through in her shadow's lag and the fragment she nearly breaks. However, interiority leans abstract ("mapping fear onto vision," "choices kneeling on his ribs") rather than embodied micro-choices under stress. The final turn feels motivated but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more declared than viscerally contradictory in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is specific and embodied—tapping the parasol tip as a tuning fork, the phrase "grips reality loosely" with deliberate grammar fracture. The shift from suicidal intent to "a narrow but undeniable path back toward living" is earned by cumulative micro-choices (volunteering, cataloging debris, listening on the boat). Minor slip: the sister's broken grammar feels slightly ornamental rather than organically motivated by her own psychology. The final renunciation forecloses the death-path with visible cost (abandoning the clinic paperwork, relinquishing certainty).

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Tomas's motivation ("to nurture intersubjective understanding") is stated rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The woman's interior reveals contradictory impulses (the ring-finger shadow, the escape/return tension), but her change feels more declared than earned through on-page beats—"it could have been" and her direct question about timing are close to therapy-speak. The burnt letter device and the vineyard metaphor do some work, yet the final moment relies on exposition ("he had watched its edges curl") rather than a present-tense choice that forecloses a path. Interiority is often abstract ("fragile bridge between strangers") without the embodied specificity or flawed micro-decisions that would drive the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The line walker's motivation is clear and his perceptual mode (peripheral awareness) is consistent, though the prophet's "strangely honest" trait feels more asserted than embodied in contradictory action. The merchant beat shows internal shift through dramatized mirror-work, but most other characters (the mother, elders) remain sketched rather than inhabited with embodied contradiction. The line walker's final realization and whispered intervention earn the closure choice, but the prophet's sudden receptivity and the merchant's shoulder-sag lack the messy resistance that would deepen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"I shocked myself by feeling lighter too" embodies a contradictory emotional discovery. Internal conflict emerges through the tension between professional habit ("solving their ghosts from the safety of my basement office") and the physical presence demanded by collective grief. Micro-choices under pressure are visible: asking the boy for details, writing in the notebook, recognizing the task as hosting rather than curating. Minor slip: the final realization ("my task was to host a communal puzzle") articulates insight cleanly but borders on telling what has been shown across prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is embodied through gesture and perception: "shoulders rounded inward as if words themselves were watching," "allowed their trust to settle over him like an old coat." His micro-choices—climbing the ladder, touching the crystal, deciding to testify in fractured sequences—constrain his options with visible cost. Internal conflict appears in "frightened him; he had spent a lifetime hiding behind indices and footnotes, trusting clarity more than courage," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory fragments (why he stayed, his fragile hope) anchor in the present crystal-touch stimulus and tilt his final stance toward fractured testimony, satisfying BRR anchoring requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through concrete actions—listening to tapes, writing with chalk, walking rearranged paths—creating a consistent character logic. The narrator and Mara's joint discovery in the fog garden shows contradiction and specificity: they seek an external sound but find their own lives "laboring to keep up with the days." Minor deduction for the prophet's trait feeling more decorative than constraining at the closure beat, where he simply waits with chalk rather than making a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilias's interiority is specific and embodied: "tired precision," "fingers working by memory," judging signal "by the sound of a leaf falling." His choice to override protocol and force the array to track the dying star is motivated by Alma's legacy and his professional ethos, with visible cost (risk of breaking equipment, defying staff protests). The secondary character Alma operates effectively as a voice in memory, shaping present decisions. Minor weakness: the phrase "changelessly constant" in describing Alma's voice reads slightly formulaic, but does not undercut the earned final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"this is what the scent of hope is like here, sharp and tender and slightly out of place"—and her decisively kind stance is dramatized through micro-choices (placing the unopened lab results on the table, giving the vinyl fragment). Mr. Alvarez's trajectory from body knowing to vocal participation in the song shows contradictory impulses (wanting the mundane hymn, not the Sunday hymn) that earn his final gathering. Minor slip: the "versions of him...seemed to reunify" leans slightly abstract, though the specific images (kites, cologne, tiny shoes) ground it. The closure choice—singing the song together—feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (the acknowledgment of death).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysa's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "each worn stone memorized through years of fearful, reverent ascent" embodies her disciplined caution. Her motivation to understand the shadow-slip drives multiple micro-choices (smuggling charts, using the forbidden key, correcting the rune-phrase). Internal contradiction appears in her "quietly deliberate" rebellion—checking every curve despite defying her mentor—and the final realization opens her into "disciplined, terrifying freedom" with visible cost (she knows noon holds more night than midnight, foreclosing naïve scholarship). Minor: the emotional pivot at closure feels slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is characterized through internal contradiction—she forgives people but not the universe's clumsy paperwork, mistrusts miracles yet completes one—and her bone-setter expertise shapes the climactic choice to guide the boy "bone by bone" into her world's physics. The interiority is concrete and character-particular ("skepticism were housekeeping," "doubt felt almost bearable"), though some passages lean slightly toward label-speak ("shrewdly innocent" applied to both Tomas's tools and the boy risks convergence). The final act of healing is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the path of refusal with visible cost (stepping through "the aching doorway of air"). Minor deduction for the boy's "shrewdly innocent" eyes echoing Tomas's tools, which flattens distinction at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—polishing glass to carry grief, measuring "how much sorrow each can safely carry." Embodied contradiction appears in the pause to "weigh the shard…testing its heft against the ache in my chest." The final choice to share light with refugees is earned by the grandmother's loss and the prior village scene, foreclosing solitary mourning with visible cost. Minor slip: the "thin trembling place behind my sternum" risks over-articulation, though it stays within poetic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—the pendant warming against her skin, jeans soaking through, fingers tight around amber—and her contradictory impulses (feeling "skinned and thin" yet forcing lightness, wanting to retreat yet kneeling in damp soil) act simultaneously in scene. The confession backstory anchors her present vulnerability without flattening momentum, and the final choice to stay carries visible cost: she remains exposed in the place that "knows exactly who I am." Eli's guarded-yet-inviting posture and his own backstory (the leaked documents, risked job) create credible secondary pressure, though his voice occasionally converges with Mara's reflective register under emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's interior life is heavily filtered through metaphor and lyric abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation—cowardice about endings—is stated by the narrator rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The final turn toward acceptance reads more as conceptual declaration ("endings are not a verdict but a shoreline") than as a choice with visible emotional cost. The piece privileges figurative texture over embodied stakes, weakening agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tinkerer's motivation is clear and his method of listening and singing coheres with the whimsical trait. However, his interiority remains thin; we see him think "alignment was less about stars and more about people" but few micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. The villagers arrive and participate, yet their individual motives and internal contradictions are summarized rather than embodied. The shift from broken village to blossoms opening reads more as external restoration than earned character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and embodied through "joints seemed to grind time itself into powder" and the meticulous unpacking ritual. Internal state is rendered through physical patience and the relationship to the world's fading heartbeat, creating contradiction between urgency (a dying world) and slowness (his method). The final recognition "the map was enough" earns closure through his sustained commitment, though the piece lacks a second character to test relationship pressure. Interiority remains concrete and particular throughout, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's interiority shows some specificity ("peripherally focused, more attuned to hints and afterimages") but much of the motivation lives in reflective summary rather than embodied choice under pressure. The commissioner's backstory and the locksmith's past are told rather than dramatized through present action. The ending choice to restore the timer reads more as completion of a task than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; the locksmith's values and contradictions never sharply collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fractal weaver's interiority is vivid and particular, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("to be caught without boundary meant every direction might still be chosen"). The protagonist's embodied engagement with burdens shows authentic internal conflict, especially in the final beat where she must "orient properly to the fear instead of from it." Minor weakness: the character's craft and history are told more than dramatized in early setup, though micro-choices under pressure (twisting wrists to break calcification, lifting the lamp higher) earn the closure. The final renunciation—accepting that the grotto will forget her—feels motivated and forecloses retreat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is consistently embodied through sensory anchors (the wood grain, kettle clicks, ash blank weight) and concrete micro-choices (closing fingers around the blank, not pouring tea, finally lifting the knife). Internal contradiction operates effectively when she keeps the wood uncarved "not to create, but to hold a pause," yet the final act of drawing the first line earns its cost through prior reflection on Luca's practicality. Minor deduction: the reflection on Luca's taming of "seconds between heartbeats" edges toward abstraction without full embodiment, though it recovers through the circus-routine physical memory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interior is richly textured with contradictory impulses—scavenging borrowed lives while negotiating with their own absence—and the final choice to surrender relics feels earned by the accumulation of prior micro-decisions. Interiority is concrete and lyric: "resolve is only what remains when all the better things erode." The ghost conversation embodies internal conflict cleanly, though the protagonist's agency leans observational until the final offering. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally drifts into elevated diction that slightly obscures immediacy under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("functionally creative," engineering lens on emotion as "flows"), but her agency operates mostly through observation and metaphorical mapping rather than pressured choice. The sextant discovery and pipe rerouting feel more like enacted thought experiments than decisions with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (hope as engineering problem vs. grief as hydraulics) but never forces a trade-off on the page. No second character appears to test relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied emotion (the slipping gear "sounded like a cough he remembered") grounding his motivations. His contradiction between hiding from failed dreams and the impulse to repair manifests in the moment he touches the clock against sanctuary rules. The renunciation of bitterness at the end is earned by the on-page repair choice with visible cost (breaking the rule, confronting the dream). Minor deduction: the backstory passages, while anchored to present stimuli, edge toward the reflective ceiling without every fragment generating an immediate micro-choice that alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is strongly embodied and character-particular—"cowardly honesty," the sundial as second heartbeat, the choice to withhold the satchel all feel earned. Internal contradiction appears on-page when the protagonist acknowledges fear yet proceeds, and the final stance (exposing rather than handing over) reflects a hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the backstory about towers and broadcasts remains abstract; a concrete anchor would have tightened motivation. The renunciation at closure forecloses cooperation with visible cost, satisfying the 600–800 word gate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli's interiority remains specific—he kneels in snow, traces rope with calluses, seeks preservation methods—and his final stance feels earned through prior contemplation. The piece avoids diagnostic labels, embodying perception through concrete actions (holding fulgurite to lantern, testing knots). However, the protagonist's emotional progression lacks genuine contradiction; he moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding without friction or self-deception. The final bow is credible but too frictionless; the story would benefit from a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost rather than peaceful acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lady Sera's interiority is richly embodied through her metaphor of "weft threads" holding brightness from below, and her micro-choices (refusing a handshake, choosing proximity) reveal contradictory impulses. The narrator's internal voice is consistent and particular ("collector of unfinished endings"), though the final acceptance of the commission feels slightly under-motivated—we don't see enough on-page struggle or cost in the narrator's decision to "help me walk it." Sera's character-specific perceptual filter (naming places by pain they contained) and embodied gestures anchor the piece, but the narrator's transformation from observer to participant lacks visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prince's motivation is coherent and embodied through concrete micro-choices: touching the egg, silencing the philosophers, ordering the chamber cleared. Internal conflict is present ("his duty to the syndicates fell away like flaking paint" versus the new purpose) and drives the final stance. The transition from passive observer to active custodian is earned by the egg's arrival and his visceral memory of wings, though the flashback ("Sky without ceilings, air without the taste of burnt oil") edges toward stock lyricism. Secondary characters (philosophers, biologist, courier) apply immediate pressure but remain functional rather than individually distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris's interior life is richly embodied through concrete details—"boots sinking into hot sand as if wading through years she preferred not to own"—and her choices under pressure show contradictory impulses (father's voice versus chief's voice carried "like tools in the same hand"). The final act of threading her father's coin onto the boy's jar demonstrates earned character change rooted in prior causality. Minor weakness: the boy's motivation feels slightly convenient, arriving fully formed without friction, though his trembling and the jar's weight keep him grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's skepticism is established early ("doubts shone brighter than most people's faith") and her realistically imaginative trait shapes her approach to the investigation. The final sacrifice—pouring her skepticism into the box—carries visible cost ("clear of doubt, not empty but open, painfully luminous"), though the pivot from guardian doubt to luminous openness could be more causally prepared. Interiority remains somewhat abstract throughout; phrases like "trained her doubt to move at that pace" feel more ornamental than embodied. The character serves the allegory more than she drives decisions through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"the ache behind my ribs where a heart might have existed" anchors the character's exile in embodied sensation. Internal contradiction operates across the piece: tending the garden to escape burning yet recognizing the familiar patterns reappearing. The grandmother's candle-pinching lesson grounds the abstract tending impulse in a specific, contradictory memory that charges the final choice. However, the renunciation at closure—continuing to prune while questioning whether it breaks old equations—feels somewhat asserted rather than dramatized through a visible on-page micro-choice with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is consistently rendered through interior contradictions—his desire for collective understanding versus solitary grief—and embodied reactions (exhaling fog, smoothing ribbon with calloused fingers). The grandmother's spectral presence creates genuine pressure that forces micro-choices across carving sessions. The final realization ("grief as a ribbon, binding solitary hearts") feels earned by the accumulated acts of carving and retracing, though the epiphany risks arriving slightly too tidily packaged. Minor deduction for the closing metaphor feeling slightly over-articulated rather than purely shown.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is strongly embodied—thumb on grooves, fever-press of time—and the guilt/duty contradiction drives the arc. The shift from "incremental absolution" as penance to "stewardship" is earned through the pendulum pause and the memory sequence. Minor slip: the final covenant feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional pressure, edging toward label-speak, but the embodied cost (teaching apprentices, sharing the rake handle) grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's discovery of their own undead status through the tapestry is earned by cumulative detail (sovereign case, notebooks, the chess game memory). Interiority is concrete—"I had planted roses in frozen ground, and this felt strangely similar"—and the revelation that the gardener "could not bear to leave the unfinished intentions" drives the final stance. The motivational arc from blithe denial to acceptance of role is clear, though the shift happens mostly through observation rather than a harder on-page choice that forecloses a path. Embodied contradiction appears ("whistling off-key, pretending the world was not made of endings"), but the climactic moment leans reflective rather than decisional, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian's interior life is well-drawn through embodied hesitation (numb fingers, trembling hands) and the layered tension between professional duty and moral weight. His motivation to avoid breaking unseen people creates genuine internal pressure, and the final moment of choosing the feather nib feels earned through the charcoal trial-runs. The renunciation of narrow choices in favor of the breathing-arc solution demonstrates contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("ignorance was both his trade and his prison") without immediate physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina's interior motivation is clear and specific—teaching dust to tell stories through patient listening and copying—and her occupational traits (copyist's accuracy, listening between notes) drive micro-choices throughout. The boy's arrival feels embodied rather than convenient, and his dust-smeared boots create a small visual reversal that validates her work. Interiority occasionally tips into label-speak ("secretly luminous" hope) and the boy's fear/hope is more asserted than shown, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—to crystallize a fleeting emotion through art—but the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother appears as a silent presence with one nod, constraining relationship dynamics to observation rather than active crucible. Mara's choices (lifting the bowl, scattering ash, releasing the last) feel ceremonial and predetermined rather than forged by on-page conflict; the final permission moment reads more as ritual completion than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's voice is sharply particular—"rationally rebellious itch," "delusion, and I prefer mine to be well reasoned"—and the interiority stays consistently embodied through sensory grounding (ankle-deep filth, scrubbing brass, the waterline's heartbeat rhythm). Internal contradiction surfaces in the gap between philosophical aspiration and sewer dwelling, and the final stance (truth "settles like silt") feels earned by accumulated micro-choices to collect, test, and preserve. Minor deduction: the Council opposition remains abstract; no on-page encounter forces a dramatized cost beyond the narrator's solitary defusal.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maro's internal contradiction between past violence ("the insults he had flung as a young soldier") and present peacemaking is embodied through conducting gestures rather than stated, and his micro-choices—closing drapes, dimming lamps, placing the zither between Dari and Ilan—advance pressure. The choir members show distinct motives (Dari's beaten brother, Ilan's blamed cousins) that constrain their participation with visible hesitation. Minor deduction: the cast is large and some members remain generic placeholders without individual pressure, though the core triangle (Maro, Dari, Ilan) sustains focus at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ariel's interiority is embodied through taste-perception and micro-choices (lifting the seed to her tongue, choosing the future that "felt most like laughter"). Internal contradiction appears when she swallows despite uncertainty, driven by a desire to create that wars with bodily risk. Kai remains functional but secondary; his panting arrival and question about safety provide pressure without deep characterization. The ending choice—feeding stories first, then soup—emerges from her trait-driven logic, though the cost (lodging the seed behind her breastbone) could be more viscerally present in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marla's involuntary truthfulness generates strong embodied tension ("the words itched her tongue") and her choice at closure—asserting the city is "worth waking" with a conditional—feels earned by prior internal conflict between duty and wonder. The boy functions cleanly as catalyst without demanding deep interiority. Minor deduction: Marla's reflective voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calcifying," "medicinal") that slightly exceeds a toll keeper's plausible lexicon under stress, and the granddad remains off-stage exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli's interior is concrete and contradictory: he notices creeping normality yet creates his own rituals, revealing a character driven by competing impulses. The orris-root gesture and bed repositioning show agency under pressure, embodied through spatial choices. The final realization that the house examines him lands with visible cost—his observational authority inverted. Minor: the grandmother's explanation feels slightly expository, but the trait shapes every on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The statue's interiority is concrete and particular—stone nerves, embodied fatigue, and contradictory impulses (fear vs. summoning) act simultaneously. The visitor's "incisively kind" gaze and her thought "Teach me how to doubt kindly" reveal character through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is sustained: the statue fears certainty yet fractures it, desires nuance yet guards a monstrous secret. Minor slip: the rulers' backstory flattens slightly into summary, but the final renunciation (settling deeper, certainty cracked) is earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin's interiority is consistently embodied through the dice-handling rituals and notebook proofs, creating a character-particular texture. The choice to keep climbing rather than enter the doorway is motivated by "balancedly daring" optimism, and the final pocket-dice moment closes with earned renunciation—he accepts perpetual ascent with visible cost (all doors behind him). Internal contradiction appears in simultaneous belief and doubt ("beautiful nonsense"), and the micro-choices (pausing at asymmetries, rolling dice) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the phrase "frightened minds" in the dice paragraph leans slightly diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aurelia's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices"), and her methodical hopefulness drives the central action. The nurse, cyclist, and balcony man are sketched vividly through embodied memory-flashes that feel earned. However, Aurelia herself makes no choice under pressure—she executes a plan without friction or cost to her own stance, so the arc reads more observational than transformative for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator-protagonist shows clear interior contradiction—arriving as a "cultured outsider" for preservation work yet carrying a "private mission" and "foolish" motives. Embodied emotion is strong: "the sour dread of stone that had seen too many partings," the emerald lens creating underwater greens where "the present thinned." The final choice to stay and teach "wondering which of us history would spare" reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (abandoning contract end, accepting uncertain fate). Minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic phrasing "private mission to rescue dying arts" in early reflection, though it's quickly grounded in the opera-glass action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurek's motivation is consistently rendered through embodied action—his counter-clockwise clocks, his careful dissection of the yoyo, his kneeling at the hunger stone—and his interiority carries a specific texture of weariness and resolve ("despair was only a clock that never changed its hands"). The renunciation of despair and the final casting of the yoyo represent a credible shift earned by prior causality. Minor weakness: the buyers and "people whose lives had already shattered" remain abstractions; grounding one concrete prior client encounter would have sharpened the stakes, but the cost at closure is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is embodied through the Polaroid and phantom hospital tubes, and his confession to the boy shows contradictory impulses (fear of living vs. dying). However, the whispering advisor remains an abstraction—never externalized through gesture or competing with Elias's own thoughts in a way that dramatizes internal conflict. The final choice feels somewhat unearned because the boy's surrender happens too easily after one confession, without prior resistance or cost that would make the release of the clasp feel like a genuine forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aera's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—reading clouds, striking with the mallet, directing weight shifts—and her fear is present as a bass note rather than eliminated. The grandmother's maxim ("Dub the world until it answers") anchors her stance without becoming therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears when fear persists even as she finds courage in percussion, and her micro-choices (where to strike, how to read resonance) reveal hierarchy under pressure. Minor slip: the phrase "obstacles are only instruments waiting to be played" edges toward prompt-echo territory but remains tied to her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Keth's interiority is concrete and consistent: guilt drives his archival obsession, the whistle carries layered meaning (turtle-calling tool, expedition signal, personal burden), and his final choice to blow a new note is earned by accumulated pressure. Internal contradiction operates well—he tells himself he's "done wondering" yet "every map he drew curled subtly toward that unreachable line." Minor deduction: the Council scene briefly shifts to external observation of their eyes drifting, diluting POV control, and the trait "quietly driven" is declared early but shown through action throughout, keeping embodiment strong.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly motivated and internally conflicted—his professional pride and moral reckoning cohere across the confrontation. The embodied details (measuring "awe against professional suspicion," forcing "each feeling into a shape that could stand as evidence") show contradiction in action. Mara applies consistent pressure as an antagonist with her own logic. Minor: the "emotionally rational" phrase appears twice as a tag rather than being fully dramatized through micro-choices under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"slick steps," "gloved fingers along the fault," the inkwell's "cooled weight"—and her motivation to archive absence drives micro-choices throughout (signing out the skiff, kneeling by each column). The grandfather's pneumonia and the vanished boy anchor backstory in present stakes. Internal contradiction surfaces when she writes "of her own losses knot[ting] into the broken patterns," showing simultaneous professional duty and private grief, though the piece leans heavily on reflection without friction between thought and act in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation to trace honest origins is embodied through concrete actions—opening ledgers, breaking kelp-thread ribbons, tracing gaps in the stacks. Her internal contradiction between institutional loyalty and truth-seeking creates genuine pressure, culminating in the resolve to "follow the gaps like tunnels" with visible cost (defying council divers, risking her indexer role). The perceptual signature is strong—"read spines the way other people read faces"—and her micro-choices (carrying the stamp as compass, breaking the ribbon) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor weakness: the "dappled resolve" moment reads slightly abstract rather than fully embodied in contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear—grief over her lost daughter—and the ritual of capturing dreams is established early. However, the actual interior contradiction remains largely abstract; she "tells herself she folds grief to keep it from rotting," but we don't see competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to polish the daughter's memory and fold cranes feels inevitable from setup rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("her heart feels flayed") but is often displaced by metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal contradiction—choosing control over preventing harm—is enacted through micro-choices: rerouting power, increasing resolution, nudging the model toward repair. Interiority remains concrete and embodied (the crystal heating against the thigh, the taste of soured lies). The final pivot to "repair instead of ruin" forecasts a path with visible cost (abandoning the mission's logic), though the choice itself happens in the last line, leaving the full consequence off-page. One small slip: the phrase "bleak exhilaration" is explicitly named twice, reducing some of the work to label.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior carries consistent specificity—the "static that has filled her sleep" and her drone-pilot training remain present through perception choices. The motivation to decode belonging is abstract but embodied through concrete actions: removing the headset, producing the chip, leaning into the eyepiece. Leto's surprised eyebrows remain a gestural tag rather than a trait that alters choice, and the final realization about belonging as pattern feels more asserted than earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. The embodied moments (headset hum, metal clicking) anchor emotion, but the climactic understanding skips the micro-choices that would show her resisting or testing the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and voice-consistent, rooted in guilt and professional paradox. The choice to gather the carvings rather than destroy or expose them emerges from sustained internal conflict between protection and truth-telling. Embodied emotion is present ("the realization snaps something that has ached wordlessly for years"), though some therapeutic phrasing ("tempered regret," "withheld truth") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. The final agency—studying the marks instead of manufacturing comfort—feels earned by the accumulation of contradictory impulses: continuing the father's work while undoing one's own cruelty.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator's interiority is concrete and contradiction-rich: the drawer pull functions as both guilt and compass, and the final choice enacts the central tension between selfishness and wisdom with visible cost. The brother's blackened eyes and the spy's nameless status provide embodied stakes. Minor slip: "uncommonly thoughtful" reads as label-only in paragraph 5; the habit is demonstrated through the tallying and angle-turning but the phrase itself is told. The climactic choice forecloses a path (saving the brother) with undeniable emotional price visible in "my brother's gaze broke."

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through contradictory impulses: wanting to vanish versus wanting forgiveness occupy the same body without canceling each other. The micro-choices (lifting the compass, turning the kayak awkwardly) are specific and carry visible cost. The final turn—paddling toward shore rather than away—feels earned by the barnacle observation and Granddad's remembered wisdom about tidal-zone survival. Minor slip: "merrily melancholic" reads as inserted label rather than dramatized state, though the buoyancy/capsizing line does some repair work.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and embodied throughout—"my head felt scraped and polished, a bare plate where history used to sit"—and the motivation to reclaim guilt drives concrete choices (following the map, using the torch, wading into the lake). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between wanting a clean slate and needing to remember cruelty. The final wade into the lake with images "rushing me" feels somewhat told rather than dramatized as bodily cost, and the shift from discovery to reflection in the closing lines softens what could be a sharper renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is densely rendered through embodied transformation ("fingers lengthen into branches, nails rooting into bark"), and the reluctance is dramatized through physical dread ("knot of dread around my ribs"). Internal conflict registers as simultaneous pull and resistance ("I do not want to change... yet my heart beats paradoxically steady"). However, the final acceptance lacks a visible cost that forecloses a prior option; the metamorphosis completes without on-page sacrifice of a competing stake, reading more as submission to destiny than a choice under contradictory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—climbing the mountain, laying cards, pressing the cloth—though the internal conflict between guilt and seeking answers could show more simultaneous contradiction in a single beat. The memory fragments (mother's kitchen, hospital room) are vivid and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final turn toward his daughter is earned by the accumulated pressure of lost time made visible, though the sob "like swallowing glass" edges toward cliché. Backstory is heavy but mostly anchored to present stimuli (the cards, the cloth) and tilts his stance toward return.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through gravitational metaphor and sensory perception of grief frequencies. Agency manifests through purposeful immersion choices that force confrontation with humanity's shadow despite seductions of violence, and the pacifist stance crystallizes under genuine pressure. Minor deduction for therapeutic terminology ("shadow work" as clinical practice) that occasionally edges toward explanatory distance rather than lived contradiction. The final choice—entering the tree-planting memory—earns the weightless flight through accumulated micro-decisions across immersions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Niko's interior contradiction is well-embodied: he denies being a prophet while orchestrating salvations, irritated yet complicit. The micro-choices under pressure (handing jars to Lila, running the ridge) show hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("texture of transformation") and the final gratitude ripple summarizes rather than showing Niko's emotional cost on the page, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Iri's interior contradictions are present—"calmly inventive" yet carrying revolutionary intent—and her micro-choices (examining the sundial, activating the rods) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is specific ("storing murmurs as carefully as she logged keys") and embodied through her appraising gaze and deliberate movements. However, Trann remains functional rather than dimensional, and the final beat where "locks forgot which side was inside" is more conceptual than a felt choice with visible cost on the page. The motivation is clear but the earned change or renunciation lacks the concrete forfeiture that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin's precognitive curse is given concrete texture through the doubled-time perception ("watched himself watch himself") and drives micro-choices at key beats. His motivation to "understand" rather than resist shapes the final action sequence, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("borrowed dawn of courage"). The eels function as a consistent perceptual signature rather than pure ornament. Internal contradiction is present but could be more visceral; the protagonist's stance feels more contemplative than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's interiority is richly embodied—"the old absence stir in his throat, that space where public language used to live"—and his internal contradictions (wanting both to forgive nothing and to go on living) drive his choice to look through the telescope. The astronomer is less developed, serving primarily as guide rather than applying her own pressure. Minor slips: some gestures feel stock ("furiously tranquil" eyes, "cracked crescent" smile), and the poet's agency leans observational until the final gaze. The closure choice to look and be changed is earned but quiet.

    Darius is given a clear philosophical profession and mechanical arm, but his interior life remains largely conceptual rather than embodied. The waiting clients never appear as pressure-applying presences; the two figures at the end arrive too late to test him. His motivations are explained in summary ("he had learned to route quarrels elsewhere") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under duress. The mechanical arm clicks but never constrains a choice or reveals internal conflict through its use.

    The narrator's interiority is vivid and poetic, with the "molting personalities" conceit providing genuine internal friction. The relationship with Lio functions as a crucible—his worry about the narrator walking away shows stakes—but the narrator's many selves feel more like metaphorical decoration than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The moment of choosing "the weary archivist" personality when the patrol arrives demonstrates a micro-choice under pressure, though the cost remains more atmospheric than felt. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("fingers shaking like the flame still burns"), but much interiority leans toward lyric assertion rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's internal contradiction—guarding written memory versus accepting the dream's deeper truth—is embodied in his physical handling of the seed and his restless climb. The micro-choices (asking for one night, placing the seed on stone, listening to the tree's whisper) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is largely abstract ("pride strain against fear," "luminous doubt pool in his chest") but remains character-particular and tied to his role. The final stance crystallization (to accept or deny) is earned by the dream sequence, though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tutor's internal landscape is richly textured—"pruning silence from branches," the compass "hounded by unfinished journeys"—and his motivation (unspoken apology) drives micro-choices like studying the lace and following the compass. However, his agency is mostly observational; he traces patterns, lifts lace, and lets an apology "exist without words" rather than making a decisive choice that forecloses a path. The final easing ("something ease") reads passive, more received than earned through struggle. Embodied contradiction is present (stubbornness melting) but the protagonist does not alter tactics or pay a visible cost that changes his stance on the page.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s motives are clear, particular, and rooted in lived cost: losing her work in the flood convincingly redirects her from “fireworks” to dust and slow change. Her interiority is specific (smell of iodine and mud, “clock she could smell on her hands”) rather than generic, and her professional lens colors perception throughout. The relationship with Amir is lightly but effectively drawn; his presence tests and names her current stance without collapsing into exposition. The only limit at this length is that we see a stance crystallize more than a truly pressured choice with visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and rooted in her craft; lines like “learning to move through days the way glass cools, slow and wary” feel character-particular. Motivation is clear (recovery, then uncovering who tried to kill her), and her shift from circling the ruins to walking toward the pass reads as an earned change in stance. Contradictory impulses—fear versus pull toward the mystery and toward purpose—are present but could surface a bit more sharply in the final choice. Still, her micro-choices around the ledger and the canyon consistently reveal a coherent, flawed, and compelling psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s bewilderment, physical trauma, and residual professional identity as a tuner cohere into a clear, particular motivation that evolves into a resolve to use his body and tools as the first instrument. The shift from “capsize survivor” as a hollow label to someone choosing a purpose feels earned through the remembered research and the tactile engagement with the forks and sensors. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“like wreckage in black water,” ribs feeling the chime), not abstract therapy-speak. The only limitation is that internal contradiction (e.g., resistance to this role) could be a shade sharper at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s weariness, duty, and quiet stubbornness are sharply sketched, and his profession-specific worldview (“give rest a permanent address”) feels particular. His decision to go alone and then to accept the librarian’s charge is well-motivated by that mix of exhaustion and obligation. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—he rarely actively resists or debates, so his shift at the end lands as graceful rather than deeply fought-for. A touch more embodied struggle under pressure would push this into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motives and role as leader are clear and consistent, and her discomfort with mystery versus hunger gives her a credible internal tension. Kito has a distinct presence, with specific physical and behavioral cues that avoid generic “plucky teen” shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Arun’s motive—to locate and release his “unused love” without burning—flows cleanly into concrete choices (using the Tear, turning the camera on himself, approaching the boy), and the past-life detail deepens rather than cluttering him. The internal contradiction between fear of overwhelm and urge to heal is present if understated. The small but clear behavioral shift at the end (risking contact with the boy) feels earned by prior vision-work. Secondary characterization (the monk, the boy) is efficient but a bit schematic, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “discover the texture of time”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices up to the final dissolution.

The internal conflict between self-preservation and surrender to the maze’s logic is legible and credibly culminates in the choice to step into the water. The only mild limitation is that we glimpse little of her life beyond this vocation, so her sacrifice, while powerful, isn’t tied to broader relational costs.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (“Most people just wanted out; Mara wanted roots”) is clear, specific, and consistently drives her tactics, from accepting chains to timing the cough.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with a clear, idiosyncratic motive (capturing the sound of trust breaking) that grows organically into the closing realization about dual betrayal.

Emotional states are embodied via synesthetic color-hearing, not abstract labels. The final stance (accepting repair rather than prevention) feels earned and forecloses a fantasy of perfect control with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thief’s motivations—fear of ephemerality, superstition around the jar, hunger to “press my ear against destiny’s door”—are specific and consistent, and the hesitation before opening the jar is a credible contradictory impulse. Interiority is vivid and character-particular rather than generic. The mirrored stranger is more function than person, but that’s not a major liability at this length. The final uncertainty (“unsure whether I had stolen or been stolen”) feels earned rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corin’s characterization is vivid and specific—his guilt over targeting lenses, his theatricality, and his repurposing of skill feel deeply motivated and internally coherent. The narrator is somewhat thinner but still functions as a responsive lens whose cautiousness and ingrained habit of apologizing give the final soft shift weight. Micro-choices (where to work, what to make, how to speak to others) all align with a believable hierarchy of values. The closing invitation to “bring someone who thinks they are uninteresting” is earned by everything we’ve learned about him.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior life is rich and specific: a phobia-ridden stunt double whose job and temperament are in tension, with anger and fear coexisting credibly (“my body kinked around fear like a wire around a magnet”). Her micro-choices—remaining in the library, engaging the boy, choosing to write on the cast, deciding to confront the studio—track cleanly from that psychology. The boy is sketched quickly but distinctly and functions as a meaningful relational crucible rather than a prop. The final stance shift toward “weaponizing every quiver in me” feels earned by prior beats and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oracle and the captain are cleanly sketched with distinct drives—the sea-commanded compulsion versus a worn-out vigilance—and their interaction feels grounded. Motivation is clear and consistent, especially the oracle’s fidelity to the sea and to silence. However, we get little contradictory interiority under pressure; both move serenely toward their roles with minimal visible cost or ambivalence. The ending stance (walking into endless night) feels thematically apt but emotionally under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    HEPA-3’s interiority is precise and character-specific (“cool ache under every diagnostic report”), with his curiosity, compliance, and unease in tension throughout the loops. His choice to touch the violin, then to vary his responses across iterations, clearly arises from that motivation and leads to a real internal shift. The final answer about thoughts coming from “the space between moments” feels earned by his accumulating experiences rather than parachuted in. The only limitation is that his conflict remains mostly contemplative; we don’t see him pushed into more self-undermining or riskier contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The registrar’s interiority is specific and grounded in her history with language and mistrust, and her choices (breaking regulations, investigating, then approaching the hooded figure) are consistent with that. The backstory about joining the registrar program to avoid the mindfield meaningfully reweights her present fear. Her final move toward the stranger, driven by “a desire to thaw mistrust with transparency,” reads as a credible evolution rather than a flip. The only limit is that her contradictory impulses at the climax (fear vs desire) could be embodied a bit more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply characterized through his bodily decline, work habits, and dry, almost sardonic pragmatism (“wisely pragmatic, chose pruning shears instead”). His motivation—to keep tending and to find a counterweight to quantified luck—flows cleanly into every choice he makes. The embodied details (hands roughening into bark, tasting soil) are strong and specific. The main limitation is that on-page internal conflict is muted; he reads more as steady than torn, which slightly softens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ilen is clearly drawn—obliging, quietly wounded by temporal distance from his family—and his competence and melancholy both feel specific. His motivation to help and his curiosity about time are consistent with his “never refused a broken thing” ethos. Internal conflict is present but gentle; the risk to the valley and the embryos never forces a hard moral trade-off, so the arc resolves in a soft, reflective acceptance rather than a strained choice. Rae is functional as a foil and pressure source but remains mostly a mouthpiece for exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The musician’s artistic hunger, desperation, and trespass are clear and consistent, and his final bow to the unseen maestro feels earned by what precedes it. Interiority is concrete and tied to the work (he “had spent his life inside other people's scores”) rather than abstract emotion labels. Internal contradiction—fear vs compulsion, skepticism vs belief—exists but isn’t sharply dramatized as active push-pull in specific moments, which keeps this just short of exceptional. Still, his motives align cleanly with each action and culminate in a credible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal conflict—wanting the hypothesis erased yet needing it weighed—is specific, embodied (“tasted metal on her tongue,” splinters in her palms) and consistent with her history of swallowing doubts. The fever episode and its aftermath plausibly degrade and then sharpen her perception without resorting to label-speak. Her relationship with the oracle carries subtle status and dependence dynamics, especially in the “ink” vs. “margins” contrast. The final endurance—accepting that “the weight is mine to carry”—is earned by prior causality and lands as a credible, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the narrator’s “religiously skeptical” stance, past betrayal of Evan, and buried guilt all inflect their perceptions, while Evan’s late-night radio pattern-seeking and swallowed truth read as idiosyncratic and human. The relationship dynamic—skeptic vs. believer, accuser vs. accused—acts as a crucible that clearly shifts by the end. The final rebalancing (“my religiously skeptical mind catalogues each name like evidence”) feels earned rather than convenient. The only limit is that the narrator’s inner conflict, while strong, never quite forces a difficult on-page choice beyond interpretive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The chronicle keeper’s motive—"to witness change without judgment"—is clear and consistently challenged by the swan’s summons, generating a credible internal conflict. His shift from aloof archivist to hinge between buried knowledge and future is earned through specific micro-choices (reading by touch, stepping onto the pages, choosing to remain at the refuge). Interiority is distinctive and non-generic, though often more conceptual than bodily, which slightly mutes emotional immediacy. The final endurance stance carries cost but that cost could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific: her early-morning rituals, the hair curl, her cautious excitement about the eclipse, and her sensitivity to patients’ anxiety all build a coherent, complex person. Her contradiction—yearning for wonder while fearing it might hurt fragile people—plays out in concrete micro-choices (promising low music, stopping entirely at totality). Secondary characters (Mr. Alvarez, Lake) are sketched efficiently but with enough detail to feel real and to pressure Mara’s choices. The final shift—grief reconfigured from lancing pain to something sharable—is credible and earned by earlier images.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Brann’s core motivation—to coax memories from walls and artifacts—is vivid, specific, and consistently dramatized through his actions and tools. His non-human nature and “politely borrowed coat” body give him a distinct sensibility, and his reaction to the woman’s question (“Why are we still dreaming…”) lands as an earned emotional beat. However, he experiences little visible internal contradiction or pressure that would force a difficult choice; his stance at the end closely resembles his stance at the start. The endurance arc (continuing to listen despite the species’ silence) is resonant but not sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s voice and occupational details make them vivid, and their decision to reroute the specs is clearly motivated by unease over the prophetic fortunes. Internal conflict (weariness vs complicity vs responsibility) is present but more told than deeply dramatized in embodied, moment-to-moment feeling. Parker functions well as a secondary pressure, but his own motives remain somewhat generic “watcher” rather than distinctly personalized. The final choice feels earned, though the emotional cost is more implied than fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jonas is sharply sketched through his tools and choices—loop pedal, ultramarine, and dialectical method all feel like outgrowths of a specific, coherent person—and his gentle, interrogative stance toward the demon is a clear value choice under pressure. The demon has a distinct, if familiar, contemptuous voice that reveals its priorities (utility, control) through what it mocks. The girl is largely an object of contest rather than a character, which is acceptable at this length but limits relational complexity. The final “win” reads as earned by Jonas’s established convictions and tactics, though the emotional cost to him and to the girl is underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli’s core motive—to orchestrate coincidences through fortunes as a way to manage his temporal longing—is vivid, specific, and consistent. The “chronologically homesick” ache plus his tactile relationship with the nautilus and glass walls create a rich interiority. What’s missing for the very top band is a sharper on-page contradiction under pressure—his impulses don’t truly collide so much as harmonize in a single, sustained mood. The final baton-raising is earned but reads as an extension, not a hard-won reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s interiority is vivid and specific—“a dozen fractured timelines scraped against one another” is both character-particular and emotionally concrete. His motivation to “conquer the labyrinth of self” coheres with his actions: using the tablet, stepping sideways, choosing to retrace. The gradual loss of floating as he integrates his choices creates a credible, costly change. A touch more on his contradictory impulses in the viaduct frame (hesitation, fear, temptation to keep the power) would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eira’s motivation—to pierce her students’ numbness—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives her choices, and her combination of desperation and restraint feels particular rather than generic. Interiority is mostly carried through sensory/perceptual framing (“silence as weight”) rather than explicit thought, which suits her, though we get relatively little live contradiction inside her beyond longing vs. professional composure. Marlo is efficiently sketched as a long-practicing listener and collaborator, and Jorin’s brief beat gives the group some individuated texture. The emotional shift at the end—Eira feeling the numbness thinning and allowing herself to be “held in return”—reads as an earned, if quiet, change.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and vivid: a cautious, methodical mind whose habits (“perimeter sweep before indulgence”) feel rooted in a real professional and moral temperament. Motivation—integrity, solitude, wariness of erasure—is clear and consistently drives choices. There is some internal tension (fear vs curiosity, solitude vs implied complicity) but it never quite sharpens into a fully fraught internal conflict. The final commitment to remain and record feels earned, though the emotional cost could be shaded more strongly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation—his fear of scent-triggered grief versus his need to help Mara and finally face Aron’s death—is clear, embodied, and drives his key choice to endure the memory rather than retreat. His interiority (“aromatically cautious,” tasting “old fear at the back of his throat”) is specific and consistent. Mara is more functional than deep, but her plea meaningfully pressures him without flattening into stereotype. The final moment of allowing grief to happen reads earned by the setup and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator and poet both feel specific and non-generic, with the poet’s prison choice and rope backstory giving him genuine moral texture, and the narrator’s safe job/lover/scholarship triad framing a real internal bind. Motivation is clear—“to discover the texture of time”—and ties well to the arrival of the energy beings. However, much of the emotional life is conceptual rather than bodily or behaviorally embodied, so their struggle stays slightly abstract. The final refusal of advice (“The choice was mine alone”) is earned but lands more as a poised realization than as a fully dramatized, felt-cost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elio is vivid and particular—his hyper-attentive hearing, relationship to unfinished cadences, and the inherited bonfire lore all create a coherent psychology that motivates his choices, especially going with Mara and relinquishing the bowl. The internal change from famine of sound to “the world is still beginning” feels earned by prior images. Mara is thinner but still specific enough (saplings in diving suits, hands on the sapling during his playing) to function as a pressure and mirror. The one slightly over-tidy move is the summarizing line “Elio understands that his task is not…,” which edges toward statement over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eve’s professional rigor colliding with her destabilized perceptions creates a clear, character-specific motivation for seeking the dealer, and her internal conflict (clarity vs. empathy; authority vs. doubt) is well dramatized. Embodied perception (“static crawled up my fingers and whispered feelings that were not mine”) grounds her emotional state. Her final choice to accept engineered empathy at the cost of her old certainties feels earned by prior beats. The dealer is sketched efficiently but distinctly through gesture, diction, and status play.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his prior ruthlessness, the shock of the letter, and his awkward but sincere attempt to deliver it all align into a coherent, motivated shift. His internal conflict between profit habits and a new urge toward gratitude is clear and credibly in motion, not magically resolved. Marin is more lightly sketched but distinct in stance (deflecting individual praise toward a collective) and her curiosity line (“What did the letter lose by coming to you first”) nicely tests him. The final decision to fund readings feels earned, though the personal cost of that choice is only lightly implied rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian and Mira both feel specific and textured, with clear, coherent motives (belonging, mapping, art) driving their choices. Elian’s desire “to graft himself onto community” is dramatized rather than merely stated, especially in his envisioned communal sculpture. Their dynamic develops credibly via the shared Siltghost search and the tag discovery. The internal conflict is quiet rather than sharply contradictory, but the final stance shift still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The illustrator’s motives (professional obligation, curiosity, and unease about “uncaging” the first echo) are clear and consistent, and the final renunciation—drawing absence instead of imprisoning an origin—feels earned. Her internal tension around the lie (“I mean to draw it… though my voice faltered over the lie”) is strong but could deepen further in the middle stretch. The canal keeper provides effective external pressure and status contrast in very few lines. Emotional embodiment largely comes through perception and metaphor rather than explicit feeling labels, which suits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corren’s motivation (find Lio vs not tearing open others’ futures) is clear, particular, and consistently expressed through his methods and restraint. His interiority is vivid and embodied, with concrete memories (the extra bowl, Lio’s fingers on the mosaic) rather than abstract grief labels. The internal conflict between retrieval and acceptance is dramatized in the spell’s failure and his pivot in the incantation. The final renunciation feels earned, not convenient, and carries the cost of definitively letting go of the hope of return.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marrow’s motivations (caretaking, desire to be “visible to those who need you”) are clear and consistently dramatized through his meticulous interventions, with the librarian’s breakdown serving as a strong crucible. Interiority is concrete and sensory, filtered through his belief in “sense memory” as language. There is mild softness around embodied contradiction under peak pressure—his ache and fear of exposure could surface more viscerally in the action itself—but the closing reconfiguration of his self-concept feels earned. The secondary character is sketched with efficient specificity that deepens rather than distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s need for control versus her envy of the linden’s effortless change is specific and well-motivated, and her backstory with her parents adds credible emotional weight. Her micro-choices—staying late, returning to the trellis, touching the leaf instead of going home—track cleanly with her contradictions. The final realization (“reluctant metamorphosis pressing inside her…”) feels earned by prior interiority rather than abrupt. The only limitation is that her resistance under peak pressure is more observed than dramatized through a concrete, costly refusal or action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and internally coherent: her insomnia, war trauma, and compulsion to “thresh meaning from experience” all feed directly into her choices. The tension between her skepticism about omens and her unwillingness to ignore them is dramatized in her treatment of the brooch and her response to Eron’s “joke.” Emotions are mostly embodied through perception and metaphor rather than labels, keeping her particular. Secondary characters are lightly sketched but effectively apply pressure without distorting her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra and Mira are both sharply sketched with clear, differentiated motives—Lyra’s professional certainty/fragility versus Mira’s quiet, village-rooted attentiveness—and those motives credibly invert by the end. The shift where Lyra feels “like the student rather than the guide” is well earned by the prior setup of her pride and rehearsed vision. Internal conflict is more implicit than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices, so we don’t fully see them struggle on the brink of refusal. Still, the final stance—Lyra bowing and relinquishing status; Mira accepting the pearl and burden—is coherent and motivated with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s vocation, worldview, and tactics are vivid and particular, and her choices (how she walks, what she records, placing the valve publicly) clearly arise from those traits. Internal conflict is quiet but present in her stance as “reactively visionary,” wanting to catalyze change while insisting she only responds. Old Caven feels dimensional in a few strokes, and his final, fragile action is well-motivated by his history. The emotional cost of sounding the note could be shaded a touch more viscerally to push this into an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Adrian’s characterization is vivid and particular—his cartographic mindset, insomnia, and curiosity are consistently dramatized, not just labeled, and his micro-choices (following the cracks again, stepping through, questioning the conductor) align cleanly with those traits. Internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity) exists but remains relatively smooth; we never see him genuinely falter or contradict himself under pressure. The brief relationship with the conductor works as a status dynamic (she’s calm, expectant; he’s destabilized but driven), but it’s sketched lightly. The final mandate feels earned by his established nature, though the cost of accepting it is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s characterization as a “sympathetic skeptic” is sharply realized in both thought and action, from climbing the tower in deliberate solitude to testing the tile for tricks before committing to the experience. The internal conflict between reason and longing for connection is active on the page (“I am not afraid… only unconvinced”) and drives micro-choices. The final stance—doubt widened to include wonder—feels earned, not sudden. The only limit is that the emotional register stays fairly controlled; there’s little mess or real rupture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The immortal’s boredom, curiosity, and avoidance of endings are specific and consistent, and his final choice to loosen the escondite’s anchors feels organically earned from those traits. Interiority is rich and character-particular (“I am tired of pages that never turn”), with no stock emotional language. The contradiction between his desire to know what comes after goodbye and his refusal to leave safety is dramatized rather than told. The closing stance—preparing to risk immortality later rather than acting now—reads as a credible, costly endurance rather than an easy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s mix of “honest child” and complicit inheritor is sharply drawn, and the final decision to split the equation feels earned by the prior tension between asylum and ongoing mercy. Her micro-choices—unsewing his chest, handling the ink, revising the ledger—are all character-revealing rather than procedural. The push-pull between wanting safety for her mother and wanting to honor the logic of “fair trade” gives credible, simultaneous contradictory impulses. A slight gap is that her emotional response to cutting into her father feels more coolly professional than personally fraught, which trims some potential depth.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurelio is sharply realized through specific craft habits (ruling columns, treating imaginary archives like “crumbling scrolls”) and a clear, particular motive that he half-denies (“his true motive is not escape but to collect the textures of different times”). His internal tension between hope for the town’s return and acceptance of its silence is subtle but legible in the shift from storytelling to indexing. The final stance (“For now, that is enough”) reads as an earned endurance/renunciation with cost rather than a neat epiphany. A touch more embodied emotional texture under peak beats (when the lamp dies, when he imagines the town turning) could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and particular, from treating the mistaken death certificate as a “mirror that refused to return a face” to letting others’ stories “layer like paint over his missing name.” His core drive—to live as a provisional, nameless archivist of erasures—is coherent and builds credibly to the earned renunciation of his old identity. Contradictory impulses (to search for himself vs. to dissolve into others’ histories) are present but could surface more explicitly in a single pressured moment. Still, the final act of leaving his new certificate’s name blank clearly forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tamsin’s interiority is specific and coherent: a professional myth buster whose cynicism coexists with a palpable, almost reluctant yearning for meaning. Her arc—from attacking the “ephemeral compass” as a myth to recognizing it as a map of her own most painful questions—is credibly earned through the cello-induced replays. Embodied emotions are present (“shame bloom like slow rust,” “gloomy cheerfulness”) and tied to concrete scenes. The cost—living with unanswered questions rather than “proving” nothing means anything—is legible if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Jae’s dual allegiance is sharply drawn, with the chip, data habit, and ties to Carnival Row making her conflict feel specific and credible, and her micro-choices (feeding Lilo data, shading the Council) are well motivated. The relationship with Lilo is efficient but vivid, especially in their exchange about “order” and how they collaborate. Emotional states are mostly shown through action and image rather than label. The only brake on a higher score is that the piece ends on poised dilemma rather than a concrete choice, so we don’t yet see a culminating change or renunciation enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ilya’s motives (to witness and record the “last of something precious” while enabling its destruction) are clear and internally conflicted, and the link to his daughter sharpens his vulnerability. His temptation to falsify the report vs. his ethical refusal is well earned. Embodied details—pressing his glove into the dust, handling the vials—concretize his emotions. The only limit at this length is that his flaw (being “purposefully curious in a career that punished curiosity”) is more implied than actively punished on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is vivid and particular—his blindness, tactile listening, and philosophy of machines feel lived-in, and Clara’s quiet deference frames his authority well. His motivation to restore the hummingbird’s “purpose” is clear and consistent. What’s missing at this level is real internal contradiction or visible emotional cost; he never seems genuinely at risk of failing or being shaken. The hummingbird leaving does not complicate him in any way we haven’t already seen.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atlas editor is sharply drawn: dry, professionally precise, quietly rebellious, with concrete tics like the "twitch in my fingers" before redrawing coasts. Her motivation—to reconcile official maps with recalcitrant water—is clear and deepens as the uncanny evidence mounts. The internal conflict between institutional loyalty and trust in her own pattern-reading is credible and resolved in favor of risk at the end. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the emotional cost of defiance remains more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ansel’s motivation—to restore the town’s temporal and communal balance—is clear, consistent, and embedded in his craft history. His interiority is particular (“as if time itself had hired him”) and the choice to stay while others leave is quietly powerful. However, he remains almost entirely serene and archetypal, with little on-page contradictory impulse or visible struggle under pressure. The arrival of the woman does not force him into a new, costed choice so much as confirm the path he was already on.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motives—duty, isolation, curiosity, and a hunger for connection/meaning—are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially in defying protocol to answer the ping. Interiority is specific and textured (“Silence in the deep is different; it feels like weight on the ribs”), and the final surrender to the vial reads as an Earned Stasis with real cost. Internal contradiction (training vs instinct, self-preservation vs answering the call) is present but could be sharpened through a few more embodied moments under peak pressure. Still, the character feels distinct and psychologically coherent within the tight space.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in his familial legacy; his motive to reclaim/reshape his father’s story cleanly drives his choices (listening, mapping, seeking the hidden corridor). Emotional texture is embodied through environment rather than label-speak, and his flaw (instrumentalizing story even when it costs lives) is implied rather than excused. Internal contradictions—guilt versus ambition, inheritance versus self-making—are present but could be tested more sharply in an on-page dilemma. The ending lands as charged poise rather than a fully paid choice, which slightly limits the depth of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator and Lady Veil both feel specific and textured, with clear drives (duty, forgotten guilt, long-delayed debt) and distinct emotional textures. Her “lovingly venomous” voice and his orphaned-apprentice solitude give the relationship bite as well as tenderness. Internal conflict is present—shock, doubt, guilt—but his ultimate vow comes a bit smoothly, with limited on-page struggle before acceptance. That slight ease at the decision point keeps this just short of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orren’s motivation—to repair his town’s spirit by rewriting its myths in stone—is clear, specific, and coherently expressed through his craftsman’s habits and reverent attention to tools. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“Yet this is how he knows to pray: by sewing edges back together…”), and his anger settling into resolve near the end feels earned. Internal contradiction is present but relatively mild; he is mostly steadfast rather than genuinely torn, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow. The final stance—a quiet, costly endurance rather than a large turn—fits the length but limits the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leila’s motives (research vs. private faith) are clear, textured, and consistently drive her attention to villagers, the stone, and the final rebuilding. Her interior conflict between skepticism and longing is dramatized through concrete actions like tracing names and proposing the teaching garden. Rafi is more lightly sketched but still registers as a wary counterpoint whose unease underscores the stakes. The final “root seeking water” image feels earned rather than abrupt, though we never see Leila forced into a truly painful interpersonal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Neve’s interiority is rich and particular, with their view of aliases as “small, controlled reincarnation” and the chalk-code habit tying present duty to a fraught past. The conflict between official functionary and quiet subversive is clear, especially in the unauthorized “Subconscious Review” box and the coded message, “You are allowed to arrive slowly.” The emotional cost of their work—“eavesdropping on their own ghosts”—is felt but remains somewhat abstract, with Arlen more atmospheric than dramatized pressure. The final act of naming and releasing the letter is motivated and resonant, though the inner fracture could be sharpened one notch further for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora is sharply characterized: her dual roles (court-acceptable artisan and covert listener) and practiced foolishness create real tension between safety and subversion. Her micro-choices—the deliberate finger prick, the way she interprets the candle, the decision to show the prince an absence instead of a palace—are coherent and revealing. The prince is thinner but still legible as a man intoxicated by impending power and impatient with ambiguity. The closing advice about becoming “a ghost” feels earned by her established worldview rather than a late grafted insight.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysa’s motivation is clear and specific from the outset (retrieve a particular instant for the grieving brother), and her interiority is textured, with “fierce tenderness” balanced against an ethical awareness of her limits (“she knew the arrogance of thinking pain could be tidily translated”). Her empathy is embodied via small choices—how she handles the shard, how she addresses the spirits, what she asks to be shown. The drowned brother and the client are sketched economically but distinctly, enough to make the central memory feel personal rather than generic. The main limitation is that the client remains mostly conceptual, so the relational cost between the two brothers is felt more in idea than in on-page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s conflicting roles—“neutral” translator vs. reluctant confessor who lies—are sharply drawn, and the boy’s mix of terror, curiosity, and humor feels specific rather than generic. Micro-choices (reading the cast despite the surgeon, choosing to lie about the unreadable line, pocketing the coral) all emerge credibly from her values. The mother’s few gestures (signing in exhaustion, gripping and then relinquishing the coral) still reveal a clear emotional arc. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that Mara’s interior contradiction, though present, isn’t stressed to a breaking point where she must explicitly renounce one self-conception on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio’s motivation and history as a banned muralist are clear and specific, and his shift from seeking disappearance to accepting a role as custodian of others’ joy feels earned. The interiority is textured (“exposed film left on a windowsill, bleaching out”) and rooted in concrete details of his practice. However, his internal conflict (quiet withdrawal vs. rekindling communal color) remains relatively lightly pressured, never forcing a painful on-page trade-off. The ending is more realization than costly renunciation, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

    The restorer’s interior life is vivid and particular—her professional mindset, the tramp’s coin, and her relation to certainty all feel specific rather than generic. Her key choices (clapping to test the garden, how she answers the mural’s question, abandoning the restoration plan) are clearly motivated and reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction between duty to “restore to its original clarity” and desire to unseal curiosity is present, though the professional cost of defying the patron could be brought into slightly sharper, more embodied conflict. Overall, the shift from ossified certainty to chosen uncertainty is well earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s characterization as a “charming rogue scholar” is vivid and consistent, and his role as smuggler/forger is cleanly motivated by the Thought Tariff regime. Mara, Jin, and the entomologist each get a sharply sketched, specific presence that serves the concept. However, Arlen doesn’t confront a real on-page dilemma or contradiction; he mostly narrates a project already emotionally decided. The ending offers resolve and solidarity more than a personally costly choice, which limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motive—to tend the absence through art and restore the moon—is clear, consistent with his insomnia and vow to “photosynthesize pain into beauty.” His micro-choices (leaving bed, using the postcard, choosing song over writing first, framing a treaty) track well with that motive. Internal contradiction (needing both light and darkness, craving the moon yet resenting its “bright cruelty”) is present but could be deepened for even more complexity. The final earned stasis—accepting the moon’s phases and finally sleeping—feels motivated and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s interiority is rich and specific—his “vertigo” at the thought of his own forgotten name, and his half-remembered council, give him depth beyond functionary status. His actions (fixing the chime, choosing to capture the unarchived name) are clearly motivated by his vocation and an unspoken fear of his own erasure. The internal conflict—duty to order vs. empathy for the wandering song—is present but remains understated rather than sharply dramatized. A slightly clearer sense of risk or rule-breaking around preserving an unassigned name could push his final choice into even higher territory.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s guilt, cowardice, and longing for repair are specific and convincing, with bodily markers (“grammar tighten around me like a harness,” “fear prickled my skin”) grounding the interiority. Motivation—to restore trust before losing Liora—is clear and consistently drives each choice. Contradictory impulses (desire for safety in silence vs. need to risk honesty) are dramatized rather than merely stated. The only limitation is that the relationship itself remains off-page, so Liora is more idea than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s craft, worldview (“every machine, every law, was a kind of encrypted compassion”), and sensitivity are sharply drawn and consistently expressed in his choices. His micro-choices—listening first, revealing his tremble, proposing rotating mercy instead of a single winner—credibly emerge from that characterization. Secondary figures (noble, mill captain, priest) are sketched efficiently through their demands. What keeps this just short of top tier is the relative softness of internal contradiction; Arlen rarely feels genuinely torn, so the emotional cost of his stance is more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Noel’s guilt, evasions, and yearning are specific and embodied (the meteorite, the pigeons, the attic rituals), and his final act of writing and sending the song is clearly motivated by the pressure the woman brings. His contradictions—wanting to erase “Noel Harrow” while obsessively preserving echoes of the past—are well dramatized. The woman is a bit less deeply individuated but still reads as more than a function; her refusal to leave and quiet persistence form a credible crucible. The emotional shift from avoidance to a costly partial re-engagement with his past feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Map’s motivation—to find her father and then to understand thresholds—flows cleanly into the final renunciation, where she chooses not to cross the strip of soil. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“featherly determined,” reading grain like weather), with embodied, idiosyncratic perception under pressure. The father’s stance is also legible and morally fraught: he’s both caring and quasi-ascetic, holding the world aloft at personal cost. The final choice forecloses reunion at a clearly felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s longing for “the rhythm of belonging” is concrete, rooted in past loss (the burnt feather, the fire) and in their odd profession, and it drives every on-page choice. Interiority feels specific and embodied rather than generic, especially in how they read light and crowd behavior through their astrologer’s lens. Mira is sketched economically but distinctly; her “softly ingenious economy” and crooked curiosity play directly into the collaboration. The final shift—from carrying the feather as an anchor of grief to using it as a tool in shared work—earns the closing realization without feeling tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s vocation, temperament (“cheerful gloom”), and vow give him a distinct inner life and a clear through-line of motivation. His unease about the growing blanks nicely complicates his patient-clerk persona, though the internal contradiction stays gentle rather than sharpened into a real dilemma. Micro-choices—following the seeds, deciding how to notate the “Not yet, but soon” roads—feel grounded in his character. A slightly stronger sense of cost or risk to his choice to investigate would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is sharply etched as an analytical performer whose worldview (“a suitcase of props and probabilities,” “slantwise thinking”) coheres with his tactics. His micro-choices—where to place the bishop, how to read microflickers—show an active, competent mind under low-key pressure. The internal shift at the end (“his purpose unclench”) is believable but comes with limited felt cost, and his flaws or blind spots remain only lightly implied. Secondary characters are evocative but largely function as archetypal pieces on his board rather than individuals exerting strong relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mareh’s motives and contradictions are sharply drawn: her commitment to smuggling memory clashes with her fear of surveillance and the personal cost of each inscription. Her choice to proceed despite knowing “their skin becomes a lighthouse” feels earned and culminates in the loss of her brother’s face. The stranger is thinner but still legible as someone stripped by the ban, enough to sharpen Mareh’s decisions. Emotional experience is mostly embodied and specific, with only minor abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—the glass-as-sand line, the harbor “speaking in a language I could finally hear”—and her values clearly drive her choices to stay, to frame the estimate atypically, and to ask for more time. Contradictory impulses (practical trade vs quasi-mystical listening, progress vs preservation) are present without being over-explained. Kade is functional but convincingly drawn as a pragmatic foil whose laugh and clipboard signal status and worldview. The final stance—accepting she’ll file the report but insisting on including the unquantifiable and taking one more day—is an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rafe’s characterization is rich and specific: the “map of old burns,” the long-carried guilt, and his compulsion to go back for stragglers all align with his final decision to confess. His core conflict—protector instinct vs. his own shame—is clear and motivated across time. Maya is sketched efficiently yet distinctly, enough to function as a real pressure point rather than a prop. The only limit is that most contradiction and struggle are housed in remembered past rather than dramatized friction in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to recalibrate hope with mathematical rigor—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice in the grotto. Internal conflict between skepticism, fear of unintended harm, and yearning for gentler futures is dramatized via the imagined timelines and the temptation to quit or smash the gauge. The moment of seeing three selves overlaid sharply crystallizes competing impulses. If anything, the character’s high self-awareness slightly cushions the sense of real personal flaw or self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, sensory bias, and sense of obligation are sharply rendered, and their micro-choices (humming, prying open the door, reading aloud, ultimately staying) track cleanly with those traits. The internal tug between walking away and accepting “legacy’s burden” is present but remains relatively quiet and cerebral rather than fully dramatized under sharper pressure. Embodied emotion is strong in textures of touch, smell, and fatigue, though the psychological cost of staying could be made a notch more specific. Overall, this is a well-motivated, particular consciousness on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mirage painter has a clear, particular motivation (earning the borrowed heartbeat by offering possibilities), and the girl arrives with concrete, embodied stakes (mud on shoes, pail-marked wrist, brother’s fear). Interiority is textured more through image than explicit thought, but we still feel the painter’s awareness of cost and the girl’s steady desperation. Internal contradiction is present but faint—the painter’s acceptance of eventual loss doesn’t visibly clash with any wish for self-preservation. The final choice to help the brother is fully consistent yet low on visible inner conflict, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s internal contradiction—repulsed by compromise yet committed to stopping killing—feels specific and earned, especially in “To sign such terms would mean admitting that justice had been bartered for survivable disappointment.” The general and envoy are efficiently but distinctly drawn, with status and weariness embedded in gesture and diction. The negotiator’s operatively gentle exterior versus brittle interior gives him a credible, painful stance under pressure. The only limiter is that we glimpse just one beat of real inner fracture; a second moment of strain could deepen the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s amalgam of ruthless self-awareness and almost religious sentiment around the egg is sharply drawn and consistent (“an overabundance of money and an understocked conscience” vs. the velvet-lined shoebox). His motivation—to manufacture a private absolution by preserving an echo—is clear and under real internal pressure. The final choice to kneel in the mud and release the egg feels like an earned crystallization of that contradiction rather than a late grafted gesture. The only thing holding this shy of perfect is that his internal conflict could, in this small space, bear one more concrete, in-the-moment hesitation or competing impulse at the act of release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Iri’s motivation—defying conformity by weaponizing suppressed feeling—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (descending, refusing the jars, weaving the echoes, exhaling them upward) align with that drive. The interiority is particular (“her chastity revealed not as absence but as fierce, untouched choice”) but remains relatively calm and assured, with little dramatized doubt or fraying under pressure. Internal contradiction (duty vs treason, fear vs resolve) is implied more than embodied in-scene. The ending renunciation (accepting that the king will call this treason) feels earned but emotionally under-strained for such a high-stakes move.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and specific—the narrator’s guilt over the prizewinning short, his arrogance, and his need to “lean away from harm” all feel lived-in. Lily and Marcus are efficiently but distinctly drawn through their commitments and the way they argue. The final mutual-reframing exercise grows convincingly out of these traits and flaws. The only reason this doesn’t land even higher is that Lily and Marcus, while strong, remain a touch schematic compared to the narrator’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Erin’s motives are clear, specific, and embodied in her actions—touching, braiding, building signals—as a way to “tie” the past into the present. The flashback to passenger pigeons grounds her current urgency without feeling expository. However, her interiority is more aligned than conflicted; we see grief transmuted into purpose, but not many live contradictory impulses in the moment. The ending shows an earned endurance rather than a sharp internal turn, which keeps this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt, craft-ethos, and desire to serve the dead are concrete and specific, and his denial of remaining guilt (“I had none left”) against the scrap “throbbing” in his pocket gives real internal contradiction. His micro-choices—following the teacher north, agreeing to touch the rope, persisting as the names pour through—are all clearly motivated by that blend of shame and vocation. The final decision to stay and recast his work in “remembered sound” feels earned by the preceding emotional journey. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the caretaker relationship, though suggestive, doesn’t fully become a crucible under pressure; her function stays mostly mentor/expositor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foresight’s motivation is clear and evolves credibly from dutiful obedience to a desire to understand why “some paths choose their walkers,” and this directly informs the climax. Interiority is specific and character-particular (his mistrust of the present, his precise playfulness with the system), and the internal conflict between bunker-loyalty and road-invitation runs concurrently rather than in tidy stages. The final choice to climb is well-earned by prior doubt and curiosity, with a visible cost in the implied loss of safety and purpose. A slight tilt toward abstraction over embodied feeling in a few lines (“the frayed edge where choices rubbed themselves raw”) is the only thing keeping this out of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tammuz is sharply etched as ascetic, obsessive, and self-skeptical; his “encrypted devotion” and distrust of confirmation give him credible contradiction. Motivation (to test the magic square and “seal a covenant with the unknown”) is clear and his frugality, solitude, and methods all align with it. The ending’s change—“richer by a question he could never exhaust”—is an earned endurance/renunciation rather than an epiphany. The only limit is the lack of on-page relational crucible; all pressure is internal and cosmic, which slightly narrows emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“resentment had grown heavier than my bones”), and the self-protective lie about abandonment versus guilt is sharply drawn and credibly dismantled. The shift from clinging to a backward story to accepting responsibility reads earned and costly, especially in the car replay. Ilen is distinct—his “campaigns of compassion” and weaponized understanding are characterful and consistent with his methods. The only limitation is that the narrator’s inner resistance could show one more concrete, self-sabotaging micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation (to recapture the runaway dream) is clear and consistently rooted in his craft, and his habitual attention to detail feels character-specific. The brief internal conflict about “losing himself” versus staying “firmly grounded” is effective but could be deepened to show more contradictory impulses under pressure. His micro-choices—aligning with the fog, tracing constellations, pressing his palm to the mirror—track well with his values and profession. The final merger with the dream reads as an earned, if quietly presented, evolution of his initial goal.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and textured—his pride, regret, and stubborn love for his daughter all feel grounded in concrete choices (signing, tearing the contract; returning to tend the orchard). The daughter, though off-page, comes across as a distinct person through sharp details (“endearingly feisty,” splicing roots in ruins). His final stance—offering a new bargain and accepting he may never see her—is a believable evolution rather than a tidy conversion. Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened further in-scene (e.g., more simultaneous pull between resentment and reverence toward the orchard/banks) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s characterization as “simply complicated” with a mind like an overfull library is vivid and consistent, and it clearly underpins his attraction to nonlinear inheritance. His avoidance of the theory, retreat to the bathroom, and final decision to step through the mirror and pursue forbidden knowledge all track cleanly with that setup. The internal conflict between institutional duty (regulations etched on the asteroid) and custodial curiosity is present, though still largely conceptual rather than embodied in concrete fear or loss. For this length, the final shift—reframing rebellion as duty and accepting being “inherited” by the questions—feels motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysa’s motivation—regret over her brother and the need to access the library—is specific, consistent, and clearly drives every major choice, especially the negotiation with the clerk and the final marginal note. Her competence as an arcane linguist is dramatized through concrete tactics (mapping gaps, decoding extinct grammars) rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but relatively understated; we feel her sorrow and caution, though we rarely see sharply contradictory impulses battling in real time. The final choice to accompany rather than rewrite the past is nonetheless convincingly earned by the established mixture of regret, responsibility, and cautious intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is vivid and specific: the narrator’s profession, ambivalence about “defining monsters,” and yearning for the garden create a clear, conflicted psyche, and the twin reads as a believable, defiant counterpart (“wearing my face rearranged by unfamiliar choices”). The final renunciation of recapturing the twin in favor of “rewriting us together” feels earned by prior tension between duty and desire. Internal contradiction is present but could be dramatized a touch more in-scene rather than largely via summary of their job and beliefs. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual over visceral at times, but the contradiction between wanting to capture and wanting to join is strongly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysa is vivid, specific, and motivated: an archivist who “believed in gaps” and feels most herself touching the “physical edges of history.” Her calmly precise method, skepticism of ghost stories, and attraction to absences all align with her choice to rebraid time. Internal conflict appears in her debate over whether clarity means reconstruction or acknowledging wounds, though the emotional cost of that choice could be shaded a bit more viscerally. Overall, she reads as a fully realized, competent protagonist with a credible, if mostly conceptual, change.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapkeeper’s motives and methods are vivid and specific—his tactile reading of rock, tasting the cave’s “flavor,” and using the stone as compass all feel rooted in a particular psyche. However, his interiority under pressure is largely professional and controlled; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or emotional fissure when facing the energy beings’ encroaching storm. The final act of conjuring the bloom of hush is well set up by his vocation and teacher’s maxim, but it’s more fulfillment of role than a visibly costly, personal turn. A touch more fraying or doubt in him at the climax would deepen character stakes significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Keeper’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning and recover his childhood plea—is clear, specific, and drives all his actions. The internal conflict between futility and stubborn hope is well etched, especially in “thistle-blown hope” and his talk to the empty sea. However, most of his suffering is summarized across years rather than embodied in a present-moment crisis, which slightly softens the felt cost. The final “rekindling” is emotionally credible but still somewhat contemplative rather than a sharply dramatized choice under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s motivation—to preserve the city’s collective memory—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed in both thought and action (“He worked faster…” as shadows shorten). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially his “preemptive” nostalgia and awareness of future absences. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see him genuinely torn between competing impulses so much as steadily fulfilling a role he already accepts. The closing realization that the city is also sculpting a memory of him is earned but remains a quiet deepening rather than a high-cost personal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The designer’s interiority is rich, specific, and bound to his craft—his past failure, chants, and reframing of fireworks as a “ladder from sparks” give him depth. His motivation (defying despair) is clear and drives all micro-choices, from using the rag knot to designing the cupped hand. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: he treats despair as a design flaw even while fearing it. The captain and soldiers are sketched efficiently as pressures rather than full characters, which suits the length but keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her vocation; her conflict between tides and terraces feels lived-in rather than schematic. Contradictory impulses—attachment to the sea, desire for Lysa, fascination with liminal moments—are all active in scene. Micro-choices (touching the pool, watching Lysa’s thumb on the cicada, closing the notebook) reveal a hierarchy of values that makes the final decision credible. The only limitation is a slight tidiness to the late realization, which edges toward a cleanly articulated insight rather than something more jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is rich and particular: the child’s claustrophobia, ecstatic relationship to the sky, and obsessive “collecting” of silences all feel specific and embodied. The father is sketched with economical depth—“design flaw,” helmet on the trellis, and his slow unwinding during inversion reveal his flaws and tenderness under pressure. Their relationship clearly changes in the final beats, with the shared “vocabulary of silences” foreclosing their prior distance. If anything, the child’s internal conflict at the climactic inversion is resolved very smoothly, with minimal mess or backsliding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rian’s motivation for the experiment and his quiet superstition around the storm glass are clear and coherent, and his micro-choices (killing the speakers, how he frames the “special route”) reveal values. The secondary characters are sketched efficiently through behavior and single sharp details. What’s missing at this level is a more legible inner friction or cost for Rian—he never feels genuinely at risk or internally divided. The final reconfiguration is more conceptual than character-costly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilya’s motivation—to answer the future dispatch and then to decide what to do with the “unclaimed throne”—is coherent and rooted in his history as someone who once refused memory edits. His interiority is specific (“that truth tasted heavy, like metal on the tongue”) and his final refusal grows plausibly out of his biography and worldview. The main weakness is that his internal conflict at the peak feels a bit under-dramatized on the body level; the choice to destroy the throne reads more intellectually than viscerally. A few more beats of embodied hesitation or temptation would make the renunciation feel fully “paid for.”

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s pattern of “burning bridges carefully” is specific and embodied, and her contradictory impulses—wanting to disappear yet wanting to be seen drowning—are credibly dramatized. The shadow keeper is sketched mythically but still feels like a person with a stance, not a prop. Her small but clear shift at the end (choosing to breathe differently) is earned by the prior build-up of suffocating silence. A slight softening is that her emotional progression is very smooth and articulate, with little abrasion or irrationality under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is sharply realized: a former pyramid-scheme true believer turned cautious laborer whose core contradiction—distrust of shortcuts yet reflexive volunteering—drives the piece. Her history with interest rates, the bolt, and her reconfigured belief in “spores, dark, and slow returns” all ground her motives. The choice to approach and open the hatch feels fully earned by this interior build. A slight further dramatization of her fear versus compulsion in the final moments could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurel’s interiority is vivid and specific—“dynasty ender” versus “custodian of ghosts” gives him a clear, character-particular tension. His motivation to understand the truth of the collapse is consistent and drives his actions, and his guilt and skepticism are credibly layered. The internal contradiction (power vs. burden, rational archivist vs. almost-mystic listener) feels organic and underlies every choice. The only limiter is that his final stance shift is more contemplative than decisively chosen, so the cost is emotional rather than actively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Calder’s internal contradiction—duty to the king vs. hunger for “the shape of possibility”—is clear, specific, and culminates in a credible, costly choice to stay but not serve. The realization that his allegiance was to “the idea of being needed” is an excellent, character-particular insight. Mira functions well as a pressure source and mirror, though her interiority remains enigmatic by design. A touch more embodied, sensory emotion from Calder under peak pressure could deepen the impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is sharply etched—her missing childhood file, dissolved relationship, and current assignment align into a coherent, particular psyche. Her motivation (“make sure no one else ever disappeared the way she once had” and to “magnify small kindnesses”) drives her choices in what she notices and shares. The emotional contradiction—broken-hearted yet tactfully hopeful—persists credibly to the end. The final resolve to “keep examining the unknown” is a modest but earned endurance, with the cost of remaining in contact with pain clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio’s motive—refusing the city’s “small ritual of surrender”—is clear and drives every choice, from tracing absences in the market to using the key. Interiority is specific enough (the hesitation at the booth, feeling “almost worthy”) to individualize them, though internal contradiction could be pushed further under pressure. The sense of being “harmless” in others’ eyes versus quietly radical in their own is strong but not fully tested in a concrete interpersonal crucible. The final endurance—accepting the burden of transmission—feels earned but more conceptually than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The saxophonist’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and particular, and his long, self-imposed exile makes his final refusal feel earned. Interiority is embodied through sound and setting (“the lake was a sheet of uninked paper”) rather than labels, and his weariness at “forgiveness he had not earned” sharpens his flaw. Internal contradiction—his love of being unheard vs. his responsibility for a deadly song—operates persuasively. The only brake on a higher score is that his emotional state under peak pressure (the climactic attempt) could show a touch more chaotic contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s motivation and fear are clear and particular—especially “Lio did not fear transformation; Lio feared misunderstanding”—and the final choice to plant is plausibly earned from a lifetime of sorting and listening. Internal conflict (listening vs speaking, order vs risk) is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. Embodied emotion appears in a few strong spots (“mossy delight tingling in veins”) but the piece leans heavily on conceptual language. The cost of the final choice is implied more than felt, which keeps the arc from full depth.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eli’s interiority is specific and textured—his profession, age, and history with broken clocks clearly motivate both his initial reluctance and his eventual embrace of “Perhaps.” The contrast between his career restoring certainty and his move toward improvisation is well earned by prior beats. Emotional conflict (wanting control vs. being drawn to possibility) is present throughout, though it remains contemplative rather than truly anguished. The final choice to “attach hands that knew how to hesitate” feels like a credible, character-rooted shift with a conceptual but not sharply painful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eira’s motive and inner life are sharply etched: her refusal to accept the city’s verdict and her need to “redeem the word” lost give her a clear, particular drive. The contradiction between the one who stayed and the one who “secretly went with him” surfaces convincingly in the final image. Her micro-choices (going to the foundry instead of home, placing the coin, offering her name as solder) all track cleanly with that psychology. The only slight limitation is that her emotional texture skews analytic and thematic, with less messy, bodily stress than might deepen peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply drawn through specific history (her brother, the circus crocodile) and a concrete professional ethic about laughter and grief. Her rituals—touching the tooth, the way she speaks to the dead—reveal a particular, embodied psyche rather than a generic “medium.” Internal contradiction (fear vs. vow; reverence vs. playful teasing) is present but could surface more viscerally under peak pressure. The final shift toward healing feels earned by her articulated motivation and on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is vivid, specific, and deeply embodied in trauma (“my body had become proprioceptively enhanced, a map of phantom pains…”), and the final choice to step into the frame is clearly motivated by the tension between revulsion and the desire to prevent future harm. Contradictory impulses (refusal to be used vs need for the research to exist) are present in scene rather than summarized. The closing stance—choosing to be “the dataset of compassion”—feels earned and costs her something legible. There’s no relationship crucible on the page beyond the disembodied voice, but for single-POV this is still rich and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation and ethical drive are precise and consistent, and the late shame about past translations softening testimony lands with real cost. Internal conflict—between professional “neutrality” and honoring the overlooked—is clear, though it intensifies more conceptually than through on-page dilemma. The painter alchemist is vivid but mostly functions as catalyst rather than a fully pressured relationship. The final reconfiguration of self feels earned, but a sharper, concrete present-tense choice (to act differently now) would deepen the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply drawn: a weary, competent tech whose ghost-sight and union-rep cynicism feel specific and lived-in. Motivation (protecting/understanding the ghosts and “what ceilings hide”) is clear and drives the choice to touch the mainspring despite fear. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized—she moves from unease to action without much on-page struggle, which slightly mutes the cost of her final decision. The boy ghost is evocative but functions mostly as a messenger rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ilen’s core motive (compressing eternity) is clear and coherently drives his choices, and his quiet defiance of the librarians is consistent and revealing. However, his interiority is largely expressed through conceptual statements rather than embodied conflict, so we feel his philosophy more than his messy, contradictory emotions. The relationship with the chief librarian hints at status dynamics but is too brief to fully test his values under pressure. The final suggestion about shelving by feelings fits his character but lands as calm consensus rather than a choice with sharply felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply drawn as a once-radical now trying to rebel on a different plane; her shift from defensive mirror-covering to protective preservation of imagined futures feels earned and particular. Her past as a leader and present as someone the Council deems “defunct” coheres with her motives and micro-choices throughout. Elyas is sketched more lightly but distinctly, his curiosity and idealism making sense of his risks. The only limit at this length is that we glimpse, rather than fully inhabit, Mara’s contradictions under direct interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is vivid and particular—his sensitivity to dishonesty, tactile listening, and vocation all fuse into a coherent, idiosyncratic person. His motivation to restore honest time and light is clear and drives his choices in the chamber. Internal contradiction (revulsion at the rust vs. compassion for its need for a “truthful song”) is present but could be sharpened into more overt struggle under pressure. The Mayor is thinly sketched but functions cleanly as a pressure-delivering secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched—a rational, sensuous archivist of change with a clear drive to follow “hinged awakenings.” His motivation to pursue the compass and the cave grows logically from his past psychometric experiences and his grandmother’s language. However, we get little on-page contradiction or emotional friction (he “hesitates only long enough to note the smell”), so conflict within him feels muted. The ending stance—sitting in the skiff, choosing to go on—is convincing but not hard-won enough to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and consistent—her driftwood practice, tendency to learn “the hard way,” and attraction to layered meanings all cohere and motivate how she engages the slide. The main change (reframing lostness as a kind of chosen navigation) is earned by prior traits and the storm setting. However, internal conflict stays relatively low-key; there’s little real resistance or competing impulse once the slide appears, so the final stance costs her less on the page than it could. Relationships are absent, so we never see her values under interpersonal pressure, capping depth.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ira is sharply defined through vocation, sensory focus, and the “question that would not loosen,” and Liora’s brief presence feels distinct, with profession, temperament, and worldview embedded in her lines. Motivation (to understand the night flowers) is clean and consistent, and his quietly compulsive sketching at the end pays that off. Internal contradiction is present but soft—his restlessness vs. his difficulty articulating what he’s seen never quite sharpens into a pressured choice. The relational arc with Liora is subtle yet credible, culminating in a shared understanding without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris’s vocation, temperament, and ethic (“Let the past scorch her…”) feel specific and consistent, and her choices—to open the diary, descend, kneel, and vow—track clearly from her civil-rights archivist identity. The internal tension between professional distance and willingness to be “contaminated” by memory is well-drawn, though her contradictions could be pushed a little harder under peak pressure. Embodiment (“breath a torn cloth”) grounds emotion in the body rather than labels. The closing commitment to catalog wounds rather than victories reads earned by what we’ve seen her endure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear and specific—moving from self-reproach and grief toward a rigorous refusal of nostalgic revival—and his final choice to design a new pattern of living feels earned. His rejection of false comfort is dramatized in both his stance toward the empty town and his refusal to aim for a simple restoration. Internal conflict is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied, which slightly mutes the felt cost. Still, his use of the wish-granted “working memory” to grapple with civic design under pressure is character-particular and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lan is sharply etched—ink-stained, ritual-bound, with a convincing professional inner life—but his internal conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in a concrete choice. His attraction to dead languages and duty to archive “promises too fragile and too dangerous” give him specificity and gravitas. Maro, by contrast, functions more as a delivery mechanism than a full counterpressure, and their relationship doesn’t quite become a crucible. The final realization reconfigures Lan’s work but doesn’t force an on-page decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motives (legacy, professional duty, and dangerous curiosity) are specific and consistent, and the pull between “I came here to catalog and carry” and “my fingers tingled with curiosity” gives the central choice credible tension. Interiority is vivid and embodied via sensory responses to the egg and the memories. Myra is sketched efficiently but sharply, applying ethical pressure rather than exposition. The final acceptance of the cost ("I would pay in years") is well prepared and forecloses a path, though the internal struggle could linger a hair longer under that decision.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motives are precise and consistent: his reverence for silence, professional duty, and fear of misusing the sirens cohere into a clear, pressurized dilemma. His internal conflict between caution (trusting the hush) and responsibility (preventing unseen deaths) is finely drawn, especially in “The choice was not between siren and silence… but between which story the valley would tell of this day.” The embodied relationship with the rope and instruments gives his emotions weight without resorting to labels. The final renunciation—stepping away from the switch—reads as an earned endurance with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The janitor’s interiority is specific, textured, and consistent, with a clear contradiction between his practiced invisibility and his longing to witness and be witnessed. His spiritual shyness, empathy for objects, and workmanlike habits all feed his reactions to the lantern and visions. The final stance shift—from “shadow with a mop” to someone who can stand and be seen—is motivated by prior beats, though the epiphany is compressed. Emotional embodiment is mostly through image and perception rather than body, but it still feels grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motive—staying to preserve the “weight of unspoken words”—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, especially her refusal to relinquish the box. Her emotional life is rendered mostly through perception and metaphor rather than embodied sensation, which keeps her a little abstract. The relationship with Mara is compact but pointed; status and history come through in a few sharp cues (e.g., “the girl who argued with every cloud”). The final stance—accepting the role of witness rather than liberator—feels like an earned endurance with real cost, not a generic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to understand the “texture of time passing”—is clear and consistently drives choices (taking the job, inventing the garage-sale method, reinterpreting the town’s role). Interiority is distinctive but more cerebral than embodied, with limited sensory or bodily emotion around big turns (e.g., seeing the child in the glass is conceptually powerful but under-embodied emotionally). There’s an earned internal shift at the end (“we were the ones doing the lending”), though it leans more conceptual than viscerally costly. Secondary characters function as glimpses rather than true relational crucibles, which keeps the piece slightly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motive—to seek beauty in the incomplete—is clear, specific, and organically expressed in his perceptions and choices. His key micro-choice is to “step beyond knowing” and tend the feather, which credibly leads to the encounter and closing stance shift. Emotional texture is embodied (“teeth ache,” “warmly attentive”) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; a slightly sharper sense of risk or resistance would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caretaker’s motivation is sharply grounded: facing six months to live, he chooses to turn the orchard into a final architectural apology. His calm, methodical temperament collides productively with his urgency, especially in the copper experiments despite his failing chest. Interiority is specific and embodied (“tracing tide lines,” listening for hums), not generic. The final Earned Stasis—dying in place as the system he built mediates “negotiated peace”—feels fully earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“luminous skeptic” and “doubted beautifully” crystallize a distinctive self-concept that plausibly drives their selection and their attitude toward the pilgrimage. Motivation is clear (skeptical engagement with an imposed ritual), and the brief kneeling/inspection of the footprints is an earned moment of micro-choice and insight. However, the piece remains largely observational: the protagonist submits to the assignment and follows the prescribed path without encountering a truly testing dilemma or visible cost. The arc is more about conceptual reframing than a pressured internal contradiction played out in action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman is specific, consistent, and motivated by the botanist’s charge; his nightly seed work and the way he consults birds show values in action. However, interior conflict stays muted—he wonders and imagines, but we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The relationship with the dead botanist is evocative yet one-sided, so no on-page relational crucible tests him. The final stance (“merely accurate”) feels earned but a bit emotionally buffered, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and risk calculus feel specific and earned, and the stranger’s grief (“her voice had a careful stillness”) gives her clear, credible drive. Motivation to play the cylinder despite danger is well grounded in the narrator’s trade and loneliness. Internal contradiction—fear of old histories versus compulsion to help—is present but could be more sharply dramatized at the moment of choice. Barrow’s characterization is vivid and affecting but primarily atmospheric rather than choice-driving.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motives (anniversary ritual, pariah status, drive to reopen “questions nobody else wanted”) are clear and specific, and his behavior—seeking out the forbidden deck, obeying the warning circle while lingering at its edge—flows naturally from them. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in his desert upbringing and family sky-mapping. The final stance (“This is north enough for me”) feels earned as a quiet renunciation/acceptance with a legible cost in isolation and self-exile from ordinary time. The main limit is that contradictory impulses under peak pressure (fear vs compulsion, obedience vs transgression) are more implied than explicitly dramatized in a crisis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thief’s motivation is clear (steal the sundial lid to pursue “apprentice of wonder”) and consistently undercut by her fear, giving the interior conflict real texture. Contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, especially around the king piece stuffed with her fear and the invitation to “meet [the future] unarmed.” Emotions are embodied through concrete perceptions (stormlight, wrong sky, catlike wind) rather than diagnostic labels. The final shift—reframing theft as openness rather than guardedness—feels earned by prior confession and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and particular—the crisis actor turned “historian of small gestures” feels psychologically coherent and distinct, with motive (to reframe trauma via archival work) consistently driving attention and choices. The tension between wanting to witness and wanting to disappear (not correcting the boy’s parents, archiving instead of speaking) gives genuine internal conflict. The custodian is sketched quickly but with clear status dynamics and warmth. The final choice—unbinding the archive from paper into the floor—credibly crystallizes prior tendencies rather than arriving as a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s motivation (“because remembering had begun to hurt more than forgetting”) is precise and deepens naturally into the more truthful “to understand the shape of home.” Interiority is vivid and embodied—shame over accent, physical ache behind the ribs, the relief/terror of speaking again. The final shift from erasing to actively resurrecting the family dialect feels fully earned and carries a clear cost to the self they’ve constructed. The only slight limitation is the absence of a sustained relational crucible beyond the brief encounter with the seer.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elior’s guilt, professional pride, and need for atonement are concrete and consistent, with backstory details (the prince’s death, exile “for being too precise”) tightly linked to his current choices. His internal conflict—initially wanting redemption or vindication, then deliberately discarding those motives—reads as a credible, earned shift. The final motive (“the wish to forgive oneself for past mistakes”) clearly grows from what we’ve seen, not from nowhere. The main limitation is that we see very little deterioration or irrationality under pressure; his competence goes largely unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zev is sharply realized—his mixture of defiance, playfulness, and hauntedness feels specific and drives every beat—while Maren’s motivation for forgiveness is clear and her shift toward “prismatic, aching knowledge” is credible. The internal conflict between wanting simple absolution and being forced into multiplicity is dramatized through her reactions to Zev’s questions more than through deep interior monologue, but it still reads as earned. The relationship dynamic is strong: Zev applies pressure, Maren resists, then engages, and their status balance subtly shifts as she gains agency in the end. Slight limitation: Zev’s own deeper stakes remain mostly implied, so his arc feels more like a fixed crucible than a changing character.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corin’s uncertainty, inherited doctrine (“broken things could be mended with kintsugi intentions”), and desperation are woven into concrete sensations and choices, especially his decision to enter the glass lung despite not trusting his own hands. Internal contradiction—wanting meaning yet doubting that the pattern is anything but his fear—is dramatized rather than summarized. His realization that the task is not to prevent destruction but to work within it feels earned by the visions and the fracture crisis. The only softness is that his post-climax stance borders on tidy acceptance instead of retaining a bit more messy ambivalence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The painter’s longing, alienation, and private promise are distinct and consistent, and his decision to finally act after the mirror cracks feels motivated. Interiority is specific (“intimately aloof,” “stranded between tides and fragments of reflection”), with a clear, character-particular lens. However, once he commits to searching, there’s limited dramatized internal struggle or competing impulse on the page; the journey reads relatively smooth. The final endurance/fulfillment is credible but costs and contradictions could be sharpened for elite-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives and worldview are specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (unpacking the box, climbing to the lamp, using the vial despite Jorah’s approach) all flow cleanly from them. The embodied emotional turn when the scent “purifies intentions” and leaves “a screaming tenderness” is vivid and character-particular. The relationship with Jorah gives a clear status dynamic and gentle shift by the end. The only limit is that her internal conflict is relatively soft—there’s little real hesitation or self-doubt in taking the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rian’s interiority is rich and specific—“patchwork navigator… stitched together from borrowed charts” establishes a textured self-concept—and their key choice (to lie about seeing Mara’s home and to build a map of solace rather than fact) is well-motivated. The simultaneous pull between truth and mercy is dramatized rather than explained, especially in the line “Yes, I lie, because sometimes raw solace is all that keeps a person moving.” Mara is more a charged absence/voice than a full on-page character, but her presence under pressure feels real through Rian’s embodied memories. The final endurance—continuing to chart ruins as a way to “set down ghosts”—reads as an earned, costly stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is sharply drawn—rational, involuntarily truthful, yearning for “psychological safety”—and Risa’s chord-hearing gives her an equally specific interior texture. Their interaction over the glass eye and the textbooks nicely externalizes competing needs (safety vs. exposure, fear vs. curiosity). However, the narrator’s internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we’re told their desire to “risk being known” more than we see it cost them in a specific, pressured choice. The final endurance stance (accepting the eye as mirror and continuing the work) is credible but lightly dramatized as a change.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Both narrator and keeper are sharply etched—his “borrowed memories” trade and the narrator’s uneasy professionalism create credible, specific motives—and the final choice to take the Edelweiss feels earned. The internal shift from “routine inquiry” to accepting the burden of witnessing is clear, though it could show a bit more contradictory impulse in the moment of taking the flower. Status dynamics are subtle but effective: the keeper initially leads the interaction, then cedes symbolic responsibility. The emotional register stays embodied through concrete perception rather than label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his “empirically intuitive” mindset, map-logic, and habit of deferring choices all cohering into the final decision. His contradictory impulses—retreating to the “dead shop” vs. risking the doorway—are dramatized rather than summarized. The lingering promise with Mara and his eight years of stasis make the closing choice feel earned and costly. No secondary characters are on-page, but the off-page relationship with Mara functions effectively as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Isera’s motives are clear and layered—disenchantment with rule, compulsion from the dreams, latent feeling for Ralen—and they drive concrete choices (abandoning harvest treaties, refusing shelter). Her interiority is specific and embodied (“taste of iron,” silks hissing, sky as a listening ear). The relationship with Ralen is efficiently sketched with status and history in play, though it stops short of a true crucible turn between them in this excerpt. The final remembering is earned but its emotional cost could be shaded more precisely on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s interiority is rich and particular—his blend of technical thinking and lyric yearning (“half equation and half confession”) is consistently dramatized through micro-choices and perception. The overheard scene with Kira and Jash grounds his unofficial motivation and shows a credible, specific flaw: hunger for connection he doesn’t quite risk naming. The present-time encounter gives us status dynamics and pressure, but the emotional stakes between the three could tighten further on the page; a more explicit micro-choice or slip from Lio under pressure would deepen the crucible. The final shift—“now I begin solving for us”—is motivated and resonant, though it lands more as a reorientation than a hard, visibly costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and self-contradictory in a way that feels earned—envy of past selves, fear of future ones, and a dutiful, almost bureaucratic attitude toward his own deaths. His micro-choices (rereading scrolls, deciding to go outside, choosing to soar toward the graves) all track cleanly to those motives. The final stance—accepting “jaded wonder” as his only honest tone—reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat epiphany. The only limitation is that all pressure is internal or conceptual; no relationship crucible or external push sharpens his choices further.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s loss of smell and adaptation to “mapping emotional terrain by listening” feels specific and embodied, and the young man’s grief over his grandmother’s temporal competence is clear and credible. Their motives drive every beat: his fear of “following time without her” and her need to repurpose her obsolete skills converge in the choice to embed the screw. Contradictory impulses (his rationalism vs. longing for ritual; her professional past vs. present limitation) play against each other in scene rather than being summarized. The final stance—accepting imperfect perception while moving forward—reads as an earned reconfiguration with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lan’s motivation (“not for promotion… but to transform scars into stories”) is both clear and particular, and his interiority—thoughts crystallizing into shards of memory—is specific and embodied rather than generic. The flashback shards (birthmark/demon thumbprint; grain-counting taboo) are tightly tied to present choices and to the runes he writes, so his change at the end reads earned rather than declarative. Internal conflict (fear and shame vs. curiosity and desire to reframe) is present and active in the ceremony. Master Sui is mostly a pressure-bearing presence, but his minimal interaction is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mirabel’s motives—professional obligation versus the need to atone—are clean, specific, and acted upon, with the final choice to publish a confession clearly rooted in earlier flaws (“I turned you into copy, and the copy grew claws”). Her interiority is particular and embodied (the perfume bottle, the smell of dust/ink/mistakes) and her flaw—commodifying people into stories—credibly drives both past harm and present repair. The internal conflict between re‑exploiting Liora’s story and telling the truth could be sharpened by one more moment of real doubt or self‑protective impulse before she hits send. Liora as a presence is vivid but strictly off-page; the relationship’s emotional complexity is strong but would deepen further with one concrete remembered scene of their dynamic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    No-One’s role, charge, and temperament are clear and specific, and his actions track cleanly with his function as “end of history witness.” His interiority is textured (“wanderingly exact,” tasting words “like a key made of dust and light”), but he lacks much contradictory impulse or visible struggle; he is almost serenely purpose-built. The final choice to perform spiral arbitration feels earned, but the emotional cost of becoming “end of history witness at last” could be more embodied. Overall, he reads memorable and coherent, if a bit more symbolic than fully human.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with his professional routines, metaphoric perceptions, and philosophical doubts cohering into a distinct mind. The central conflict—tending the clocks versus doubting what they measure—intensifies credibly through dreams, the key, and the rooftop ritual. The final renunciation of the key feels earned by prior reflection and curiosity, with a clear cost in lost certainty. Emotional embodiment stays in image and perception rather than labels, which suits his temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and particular—the “spatially gifted” lens, corporate-security past, and ambivalence about being a “wall” create a specific, flawed consciousness whose final decision feels earned. Contradictory impulses (duty vs hunger/solidarity; fear vs curiosity) are dramatized in the thumb-on-laser beat and the hesitation at the door. Rae functions as a precise foil who applies pressure without turning into a mouthpiece. The only limit is that the external cost of the choice (what they risk in opening the dock) stays largely conceptual rather than embodied in the protagonist’s fear.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rich, specific interiority (“the dutiful probability professor daughter of a compulsive gambler” who is also “the kind of coward who questions rules but obeys them”) creates a convincing, self-contradictory protagonist. Her micro-choices—avoiding the hospital, wandering the stacks, pocketing the note, and finally writing on its back—track a clear emotional progression with cost. The father, even mostly sedated, feels particular and alive through details like fingers twitching “as if shuffling chips” and his “lantern trick.” The final exchange about odds and staying is earned and reveals a genuine, unresolved but deepened bond rather than a tidy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lena’s blend of “cultivated estrangement” and clear caretaking impulse is specific and appealing, and her vocation feels psychologically plausible. Her micro-choices (letting silence breathe, spinning the disc, asking where Mara stands, tying the ending to the streetlamp cycle) track cleanly with that motivation. The internal contradiction—needing distance yet craving these wrong-number intimacies—is present but more stated than dramatized in the scene, so we rarely see her truly strained by it. Mara’s sketched conflict is convincing for this length, though she remains more emblematic than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s motivation—an oath-bound, grief-angled devotion to remembering what others let wash away—is specific and consistent, with the locket/Mara backstory deepening that drive. Her profession and temperament clearly govern her choices (coming at twilight, using ritual, writing until the paper feels “heavy enough”). Internal contradiction is quieter—duty vs. unresolved attachment to Mara—but present in the way she downplays her own agency (“I only steeped a photograph…”) while still orchestrating a powerful rite. The emotional cost of continuing her work after seeing Mara is tangible but remains an earned, nuanced endurance rather than a dramatic break.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply realized—her mix of competence, elusiveness, and wry authority feels specific, and her choices (how to frame the Exchange, what experiment to propose) are motivated and consistent. Kenji’s motive—seeking a “cure for loneliness” while honoring the reciprocity oath—is clear and drives his key decision to bring the rock here. However, his interiority remains mostly summarized rather than embodied; we don’t inhabit his loneliness in the body, so his shift at the end, while credible, is more conceptual than felt. The relationship dynamic between Mara and Kenji is intriguing but stays at a lightly sparring rapport instead of becoming a crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orrin’s motivation is specific and consistent—an emotional cartographer seeking an inner map rather than a route home—and his realization that the compass points inward is well earned by prior beats. The backstory voices (mother, brother, apprentice) give him textured, non-generic guilt and longing. His final choice to “stay” and map himself before any further shore forecloses a path in a credible way, though the internal contradiction under peak pressure could be sharpened one notch further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s guilt, exilic self-conception, and drive for redemption are vividly particular, and his micro-choices around using the pen feel psychologically consistent. The brother’s apology and the dead child ground his remorse in concrete, costly specifics. His shift from craving erasure to accepting revision as the only possible redemption is a credible, earned change. The only slight limitation is that his ambivalence under pressure is more told than dramatized once he grasps the pen’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena is sharply realized through her embodied relationship to silence, sign, and the camera, and her motivation—to translate silence into something she can “hear”—is clear and consistent. The advisor is more archetypal but functions well as an externalized inner voice or guide. Emotional detail is concrete (lonely birthdays, the father’s slammed door), though her present-tense ambivalence under pressure could be shaded with one more contradictory impulse on the page. The final shift into laughter feels earned by the prior buildup of mapped silence and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (guilt over the arson, need to “rescue a forgotten promise”) are clear, specific, and consistently expressed in perceptions and choices. Interiority is rich and embodied—e.g., “volcanic tenderness rising without face or word,” “my ribs were doors”—and the internal contradiction between past destruction and present preservation is compelling. The final choice to stay and stitch a new trail is well earned by that contradiction rather than feeling like a neat fix. The only limitation is that the teen promise / banned book backstory is summarized rather than more sharply dramatized, which slightly blunts the peak emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, specific, and embodied (“as if the injections turned my nerves into film”), and her micro-choices—slipping from the loop, perching on the rail, turning a nervous tic into a signal—consistently reveal the “quietly rebellious” trait. Motivation is clear and escalates from curiosity/self-soothing into a risky, collective act. Internal contradiction (fear vs pull toward connection and resistance) is present but could be sharpened with one more concrete moment of doubt or temptation to comply. The endurance/renunciation at the end is more conceptual than felt-cost personal, which keeps this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo is specific and vivid—the way he reads walks, tends the maze, and stages “calculated spontaneity” all cohere into a strong, particular character. His competence and quiet showmanship motivate his choices clearly, including the pre-oiled vents and acceptance of Ramos’s “deal.” What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal conflict or cost under pressure—he never really doubts, frays, or risks something personal beyond job stakes. Ramos’s status dynamic with Milo is nicely sketched but could bite harder in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The guardian and dentist are both sharply etched, with clear, consistent motives: listening and witnessing versus paralyzing guilt. The dentist’s internal conflict—“words lodged like broken teeth”—credibly drives his avoidance and then the choice to call. The guardian’s empathy maturing into purposeful intervention is coherent and persuasive. The only limitation is that the dentist’s psychology could carry one more concrete, idiosyncratic detail to feel fully singular rather than slightly emblematic.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Daniel’s interiority is precise and character-specific—the way he maps the town to a chessboard and listens for “what can you do” beneath people’s words feels lived-in and consistent. His motivation for a “humble rebellion” is clear and drives his choices without wobble. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page inner conflict or visible cost; he never seems truly torn or personally at risk. Milo is effective but mostly a mirror/ally, not a crucible that forces harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is sharply realized: a “graceful dock worker” whose barbed speech and tender touch embody a lived contradiction, and her history with strain grounds both her competence and guardedness. The pirate is sketched with economical vividness and clear motives that directly pressure Mara. The final act of accepting the scrimshaw and listening is well-motivated by her earlier ambivalence about softness and pain. The cost of opening herself is more implied than dramatized, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Both the performer and Mara are sharply etched: their roles, constraints, and small acts of defiance are clear, with the Joy Amplifier’s covert sedition and Mara’s trained resistance to feeling playing off each other. Interiority is specific (Mara’s “gym exercise for the face,” the performer “building a hush”) and contradictions—state functionary as lawbreaker; a grieving woman too exhausted to cry but afraid to relax—are believable. The final micro-shift (“she let it stay”) feels earned and registers as a meaningful, if small, choice with visible risk. The only thing keeping this from the absolute top is that their internal conflicts never quite spike into a more actively fraught moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio’s motives (returning under state sanction but not complying with their script) are clear and specific, and his interiority—burned notebooks, stored “weather” of words—feels lived-in rather than generic. The arc from tentative re-entry to a fragile new belief and quiet refusal of the gratitude role is credible and earned. Internal contradiction (resentment at the council vs. desire to speak to the town again) is present but could be sharpened into more in-the-moment conflict rather than mostly recollected pressure. The final choice to step down from the dais and walk among the pillars reads as a meaningful, character-rooted renunciation with cost, though the cost remains conceptual rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is rich and specific—her colorblindness, her barter economy, and her ethos of “broken things” all cohere into a distinct psyche. Motivation is clear and consistent, and her choice to take the impossible commission fits her pattern. The stranger is sketched efficiently but remains largely a function rather than a full counter-presence. The internal change at the end (a deepened fulfillment of her calling rather than a sharp turn) is quiet but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elya’s interiority is rich and specific, with a clear tension between institutional demands (“outcomes, metrics, and breakthroughs”) and her wish for a simpler “texture of connection.” Her micro-choices—ignoring the score, questioning the premise of guidance, inviting the visitor into an un-mapped walk—are all well-motivated. The visitor is sketched efficiently yet distinctly (paint-splattered boots, sleeplessness, wanting the lights to fail), and their openness under pressure contrasts Elya’s guarded doubt. The final shift in Elya’s stance toward connection feels earned and carries a quiet but real cost in relinquishing control and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ela’s grief, craft, and incremental shifts in what she makes are sharply characterized and consistently motivated by the loss of her sister and her ambivalent wish to move beyond pure mourning. Her choices—to accept Riv’s proposition, to hide coordinates of her own “failures” in the birds, to pivot toward pieces for the “almost-living”—all arise credibly from that pain. Internal contradiction (wanting both to disappear and to leave a trail) is present and dramatized in actions rather than labels. Riv is vivid but more concept-figure than fully explored character, which keeps the relationship crucible from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara feels specific and motivated—her ritualized use of obsolete tools and her refusal to look at the graphs embody her drive to “reverse engineer belief,” and Jonas’s mix of skepticism and hope provides a clear relational crucible. The pivot when she admits the pattern “is us” creates a credible, if subtle, vulnerability shift. Internal contradiction (intellectualized project vs. personal stake) is implied more than dramatized moment by moment, which keeps this just shy of fully profound psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hiran’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: his professional discipline, forbidden hunger for knowledge, and desperate concern for the cracking world above all collide in the choice to defy the Council. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“breath that tasted like rust,” dust stinging his eyes). His decision to embrace the full pattern and to stay below as solitary bearer of memory feels earned by the preceding pressure. The only limit is that his flaw-set and past are gestured at rather than made uniquely his beyond the archetype of the transgressive scholar.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s interiority is rich and specific: the bracelet of river stones, his gentleness with the “blooming” dreams, and his history of regret all shape how he responds under pressure. His final choice to house the shadows is well-motivated by his established need to make his regret “useful instead of heavy.” The internal conflict between tending others’ hope and confronting a concrete lost future (Lane) is present, though it could surface in sharper, more contradictory impulses in the climax. Overall he feels fully individual and emotionally credible within the compressed length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is rich, specific, and convincingly torn between flight and accountability, with the tail-tip decision emerging organically from that conflict. Her blind spots—especially around her earlier complicity—are dramatized rather than excused, and the line “Guilt travels light” crystallizes her current state effectively. Mara works well as a crucible figure, applying pressure without drifting into caricature. The only minor limitation is a touch of self-analytic clarity that edges toward essayistic in one or two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motive—to seek closure yet compulsively reopen wounds—is sharply drawn and governs every major choice, from the surgery to her fascination with scars. Interiority is vivid and particular (“a displaced miracle, a salvation that showed up in the wrong room”) and her self-critique feels earned rather than therapized. The simultaneous hunger to help and impulse to harm are present in-scene via her memories of questioning patients. The closing acceptance of a new, less-invasive role (“You will not close wounds anymore; you will read them…”) is a believable evolution of that contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s longing to locate “where unused love is stored” is vivid, embodied, and consistent, and her final revaluation of the goodbye letters feels earned by what she witnesses. Her interiority (“secret egg under the ribs,” the chest-ache) is concrete and particular. The projectionist is sketched efficiently as a foil and guide. The only limit is that her internal conflict never bites quite hard enough into an on-page dilemma; the realization comes smoothly rather than against visible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior life is rich and specific: the nuisance of hearing unspoken words, the inherited relationship to the grandmother’s work, and the braid of “terror and longing” all feel particular rather than generic. Motivation—seeking “rest” by freeing trapped creativity—is clear and deepens as the scene escalates. The final surrender to emptiness-as-space is earned by the buildup of backlog and pressure. The only limit at this length is that we see them entirely in this one crisis mode, with little room for contradiction beyond fear vs. desire.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—an exhausted, almost ritualistic duty to “keep watch” and later to “cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners”—is specific, consistent, and deepens as the piece accrues. Interiority feels embodied and idiosyncratic (“my boots still follow their straight, rusted memory”; “wider than loneliness, and that feels like a kind of charm”), not generic angst. The internal conflict between futility (no trains, burned forests) and refusal to stop (winding the clock, inventing schedules, singing) reads as an earned endurance arc rather than a tidy revelation. The only ceiling is that his stance at the end is a refined continuation, not a materially reconfigured self that forecloses a new path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator’s curiosity and compulsive questioning are clear and consistent, and the hesitation before placing the gear (“feeling the probable weight of what would happen”) gives a credible moment of ambivalence. Interiority is specific to a drifting, self-aware thinker, not generic. However, internal conflict is underplayed—once in the rainforest, there’s little sustained resistance or fear to complicate the drive toward insight. The final acceptance of the vision feels earned but not especially costly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s fear/necessity tension is specific and embodied (“her fear ran beside her, panting”), and her choice to descend feels earned by the dinner blow-up and accumulated memories of past silence. The guides are archetypal but not flat; their gentleness and matter-of-factness about courage give them dimension. The internal arc—moving from “I do not know if I have any courage” to accepting the walk into herself—reads as a credible shift with real cost implied in what she’s leaving behind. A touch more concrete friction with the father or shop on the page would deepen the felt stakes of that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bellhop’s interior conflict—obedience and fear versus curiosity and moral recoil—is specific and credible, and it tightens cleanly from the bolt moment through the staircase revelation. His micro-choices (picking up the bolt, leading her to the forbidden stair, finally speaking) progressively expose a hierarchy of values. The guest functions well as a crucible, pressuring him with memory and an alternative reading of “safety.” The final renunciation of silence feels earned and costly, not a sudden conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The titan is sharply etched—small but pressurizing stone, former chart-maker, patient caretaker—with a clear, particular motivation and a concrete way of sensing lies (“the way a musician hears a false note”). His actions (grinding ink from broken oaths, choosing specific texts) align with that motive and reveal a cohesive worldview. Internal conflict is muted; he never truly questions his course or confronts a cost beyond abstract patience, which keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at a deep emotional level. The scholar arrives as mostly a function—her flickering age is evocative but she has minimal individuated psychology beyond exhaustion and receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—the decompression-chamber tapping, the shift from counting coral colors to numbers on a screen, the quiet withholding of the atlas page. Motivation (to understand disappearing paths) is coherent and present from start to finish, and the small choices (silent concealment, then experimental tapping) align with that drive. Internal contradiction—rational scientist vs. almost mystical belief in rhythm—is implied but never fully put under sharp on-page pressure. The ending reads as a credible deepening of an existing stance rather than a costly change, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and textured—bare feet on the plating, the uneasy weight of “barefoot stargazer,” and her attraction to coherence over slogans all feel lived-in. Her contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire for meaning, weariness vs. responsibility to “keep the coals from freezing”) are active in scene and culminate in the choice to send the message. The closing act is well-motivated by what we’ve seen of her temperament and history, though the emotional cost of that risk could be shaded a hair more sharply. Overall she reads as an individual, not a type, with credible, non-tidy ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Characterization is vivid and specific—Teta Lila’s history of uprisings, scars, and aphorisms about tools and gifts, and the narrator’s plant-centered perception feel lived-in and coherent—but the narrator’s own internal contradiction under peak pressure is relatively mild. Their final act (asking the embryo if it wants to be born, then helping release it) aligns cleanly with everything established, which is satisfying but emotionally safe. The relationship dynamic (grandmother as radical teacher, grandchild as gifted apprentice) is strong and believable, especially in the shared ritual. A touch more embodied ambivalence or fear around defying the council and dissolving the embryo would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mariam’s characterization is rich, embodied, and specific: the henna background, the shoulder ache, the freeze at gulls, the conflicted need for safety and reality all cohere. Her contradictory impulses—wanting to feel safe yet refusing unreality—play out credibly in her choice of setting and her cautious return to writing. The therapist material risks mild “therapy-speak” but is grounded in her sensory experience and doesn’t undercut authenticity. The final endurance—keeping the photo but folding it small—is a believable, costed stance rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s grief, artistic perfectionism, and self-disgust are rendered with specific, character-particular interiority (“he painted people better than he ever touched them”). His motives for engaging the cards and the book are clear and consistent, and his final resolve to paint possible selves feels earned by what precedes it. The internal contradiction between wanting light and choosing “necessary darkness” is nicely present but could be tested more sharply in scene, not just in thought. Because no other character is on the page in the present, the relational crucible is limited to memory.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Iren’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete memory (his mother and the falling rock) and present-moment embodiment (“serene anger…heavy as cooled glass”). His motive—to understand and potentially master the Crisis Slow—flows cleanly from that trauma and his distrust of “mercy.” The elders are sketched but functional as pressure sources, pushing his talent and marginalization (“born half-vanished from the sun”) toward a costly choice. The final act of loosening his sense of self at the ink is earned and reads as a charged endurance/renunciation rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ana’s interior conflict is specific and well-rooted in her role: archivist-as-virologist versus emerging desire to witness and share. Her motives escalate cleanly from curiosity to ethical defiance, and the final choice to falsify the incineration reads as an earned, costly stance. Embodied responses (“trembling, not from cold”) ground her emotions without drifting into diagnostic language. The only thing holding this just shy of the very top is that her flaw-set (fear, indoctrination, hunger for connection) is implied rather than stress-tested across multiple distinct beats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is sharply etched: Jorek’s pacifist daughter who repurposes inherited violence into cultivation, with consistent micro-choices (pruning, engraving, hosting dangerous men with tea) that reveal her value hierarchy. Her senseless perception, refusal to weaponize it, and commitment to “engraved quiet” feel particular and earned. Internal contradiction—born to a hunter, choosing neutrality and mercy—is present but kept mostly at the conceptual level; we rarely see her tempted to break pacifism in scene, which would deepen cost. Still, the endurance stance at the end reads as a credible, costly renunciation rather than default passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fisher’s motivation is clear and specific—catching the goddess’s echo and his tormenting “not-knowing”—and his final renunciation feels earned by the build-up of his history and gift. Interiority is particular and embodied (e.g., the taste of salt, “impossible grief,” his hands on the rail spike) rather than labeled. The contradiction between his professional identity as translator of emotions and his refusal to translate the final feeling is a strong, character-specific conflict. I’d push slightly higher only if we saw one more moment of genuine temptation toward selfish or grandiose questions before his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is rich and specific: we see her calibrating how many rings before she answers, parsing “not satellites” like a typesetter, and gripping the pen nib as a gavel, which makes her final choice feel earned. Her conflict between filial loyalty and ethical responsibility is active on the page, not abstract. Tariq is lightly sketched but distinct in his habits and role. The only reason this isn’t higher is that we glimpse only the first step of how her decision will strain or transform that central relationship with her father’s legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, guilt, and reluctant custodianship are sharply drawn, with specific, character-particular details (constellation tattooist, baby-cry translator) that inflect every choice. The central conflict between wanting to keep her brother’s voice and needing to quiet the “dissonance of old guilt” culminates in a credible, costly decision to play the voicemail. Internal recoil (“everything in me recoils like tape catching on a bent reel”) versus action on the failsafe shows genuine contradictory impulses in scene. The only mild limit is that we never see a real-time relationship dynamic—everything relational is refracted through memory—so the crucible is slightly abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lark’s characterization is vivid and specific: a whimsical sidewalk artist drafted into a sacred role, skeptical yet curious, with socially tuned perception that shapes her choices. Her inner conflict between playfulness and the dawning weight of responsibility culminates cleanly in “it meant she could never again pretend her art was harmless.” The boy is sketched efficiently through behavior (clutching the sketchbook, staring at the ceiling) and functions as a crucible for her shift rather than an ornament. The only limitation is that her past and flaws are implied more than dramatized, keeping the emotional cost on the quieter side.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Laleh is vivid and particular—“gentle radical,” soot scars, steel limbs, aberrant mercy—and her core motive to reframe the fire and cradle others is clear and consistent. Her decisive act (renaming fire/sky/plaza, hinging the city’s stance toward its trauma) is motivated by her retrocognitive insight and her refusal of rationed mercy. However, interior contradiction is underplayed: we’re told people distrust her, but we see little of her own doubt, anger, or selfish impulse in live tension with her gentleness. As a result, she reads slightly idealized and emotionally smoothed where a bit more conflict in her would deepen the final choice’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina and Marcel both feel specific and textured—her synesthetic perception and his flickering costumes embody their inner lives elegantly. Motivation is clear (save the theater’s magic vs. chase applause), and their brief exchange shows a plausible partnership forming. Internal contradiction is mild: Marcel’s hunger for applause vs. willingness to risk restructuring himself is implicit more than dramatized, and Lina never truly wavers. The ending choice (“let us try again”) is earned but its emotional cost is more suggested than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eli and Naya both feel specific and legible, with Eli’s burdened hyper-awareness and Naya’s “affectionate skeptic” stance shaping every exchange. Eli’s motivation—to stop being chewed up by other people’s echoes while honoring his ethics—is clear and consistent. The micro-choice to “treat this like a design problem” is a credible turn that fits his temperament. Internal contradiction (resenting the power yet using it to help) is present but could be pushed slightly harder for a more visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Iri’s motivation and professional identity are clear and particular, and the internal contradiction between “I am not a machine” and being built to serve sleeping humans adds welcome texture. Their conflict between training (no speculation) and charter (speak for what cannot speak) sharpens nicely in the final beats. Emotional embodiment is mostly filtered through perception of setting rather than bodily sensation, but it still feels grounded. A slightly deeper sense of personal risk or doubt in the closing exchange could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s goal and motive are clear and specific—steal the canyon echo to prevent the Council from fixing a single, rigid prophecy—and her patience and methodical nature are well dramatized via the button-mapping scheme. Her interior realization about “shared wisdom” versus “shared conclusions” credibly motivates the final choice to release the echo. Internal conflict (belief in order vs. discomfort with obedience) is present but could be more sharply dramatized in-scene rather than largely summarized. The cost of her choice is mostly conceptual rather than personally felt, which slightly softens the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and coherent: burned spy, cut loose, still compulsively watching, pulled by loyalty to Mara and the urge to “fix what breaks.” His micro-choices (coming to a compromised site, following the snow code, pocketing the new pillbox, choosing to wait rather than rush) align with that motivation and reveal his value hierarchy. Contradictory impulses—caution vs. stubborn hope, expendability doctrine vs. Mara’s heresy—are present without being over-explained. The final stance (charged, patient waiting with the key) is earned and forecloses simpler paths of revenge or retreat with a palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is rich, specific, and bound to his work; his habit of “darning…silences” with the needle and holding layered promises gives him genuine complexity. The mother and boy are sketched quickly but with vivid, embodied detail that hints at deep emotional stakes without over-explaining. The culminating act of holding her plea against all previous vows and thinning them into “spindrift serenity” reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than an easy insight. The only thing holding this shy of the very top is that the mother’s own inner conflict stays almost entirely inferred rather than slightly more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The potter’s motivation (to understand why the oasis endures) is clear and coherently expressed through his methods and choices, especially his decision to “flood this place with [kindness]” via clay and seeds. His interiority is specific and non-generic, with a distinct blend of craft-minded observation and moral inquiry. The internal conflict is quiet but present—he both studies and participates, torn between detached observer and caretaker—though it never reaches a sharp contradiction. The closing stance (gentle resolve without self-loathing) is earned by prior beats and carries a credible cost in relinquishing pure detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s characterization is textured and specific: the fire escape gardener who saves cracked teacups, shaped by a lockmaster father, feels singular and lived-in. Her conflict between protected caution and a desire to create safety for others culminates in the choice to transform the garden into a constellation of light. The internal turn (“What she really wants… is to reflect light into dark corners”) is well motivated by prior details. The cost—accepting exposure and potential foolishness—is felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s motivation—to make isolation livable and useful—is clear, consistent, and deepens as the story reveals their age and losses. Interiority is specific (“brittle awakenings,” uncertainty about which memories are theirs) and the apparition functions as both counterpart and pressure rather than a mere expositor. The final stance—choosing to make the library a harbor while accepting extinction as irreversible—feels earned and forecloses a fantasy of restoration. There could be a touch more embodied contradiction under pressure, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s occupation, burden of “leftover echoes,” and private quest for the connecting thread create a particular, textured interiority. Her conflict—writing for others while secretly seeking her own answer—is dramatized in concrete choices (coming despite the rain, spreading abandoned fragments, deciding what to engrave). The architect’s small tremor and implied grief sharpen relational stakes without over-explaining him. The final slackening of “invisible knots” feels earned and paid for by years of accumulated unsentences.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivations are specific and consistent—she’s driven by curiosity, resistance to institutional power, and a wary fascination with the Void. Interiority is vivid (“she did not feel like prey or pawn but like a gambler setting the table”), and her final stance feels earned. The shift from passive listener to active interlocutor tracks cleanly through micro-choices (killing the playlist, retuning, patching in sub-bass). Internal contradiction is present but could be sharpened further; her fear of the tricksters rarely threatens to stop her.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The explorer’s mix of claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” restraint is consistently dramatized, especially in the canyon approach, the three-hall choice, and his hesitation at the stair. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“measuring each risk like a surveyor,” reciting measurements as a prayer). His final decision to descend under pressure from both fear and obsession reads earned and costly. The only ceiling on this score is that his flaw set and history, while strong, remain relatively narrow for truly top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jonas is sharply etched: prosopagnosia, methodical practice, and his idiosyncratic theory of justice all feel specific and lived. His behavior—painting on-site when the file is “hollow,” tracking gallery reactions—aligns cleanly with those traits. Internal contradiction is relatively muted (he’s remarkably sure of his method), but the piece hints at tension between his belief in empathy and the detective’s more conventional expectations. Rhea is sketched efficiently through motion and status dynamics, adding credible pressure without diluting his focus.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivations (ancestral vindication, need for purpose in exile) are clear and drive each key choice, especially confronting the director and subverting the data log. Her emotional life is embodied in the damp, claustrophobic station and the tactile presence of the nail. Internal contradiction—dread vs. idealistic drive—reads credibly, though it never quite sharpens into a wrenching dilemma. The director is thin but sufficient as institutional pressure rather than a full character.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fiddler’s interiority is rich and particular—his “bridge-song” history, his almost-leap, his unspoken apology—all clearly drive his present choices. His motivation to “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” is dramatized rather than merely stated through the way he uses the glass and the song. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. disbelief, helplessness vs. agency) are present in scene, especially as he hesitates over which frames of the hitchhiker’s fate to “forgive.” The hitchhiker is thinner but still registers as a real person via bewilderment and wordless acceptance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply particular—highway bandit lineage intersecting with fintech founder—with motivations that feel coherent from stolen trucks to startup circuits. His return to the train after investor abandonment is well-motivated and the foreign bills/territorial markers reveal character under quiet pressure. The internal change is a nuanced repricing rather than a big decision, but it is earned by the accumulated backstory. Some emotional conflict could be more embodied in the present moment rather than mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Both narrator and Aria feel specific and lived-in, with professional detail (“lucid dream chronicler,” “starguard…Counselor”) informing how they move through the scene. The narrator’s mix of skepticism, obsession, and defensive humor reads cleanly, and Aria’s tired gentleness plus hinted grief (“faint tremor of fatigue and something like grief”) gives their dynamic texture. Motivation is clear—understand the temple, justify the work, relieve psychic pressure—and the final realization of “my own healing” is earned by their prior openness to the process. Internal contradiction (professional detachment vs personal vulnerability) is present but could be dramatized in one or two sharper on-page frictions rather than mostly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arlen’s motivation is clear and particular—his guarded distrust of illusion paired with an obsessive need to interrogate the magician’s “I changed nothing.” His gift for sensing loss is tightly tied to his worldview and method, and his final reversal to “I changed everything” reads as an earned inner stance shift. However, his inner conflict stays mostly conceptual; we rarely feel him pulled between contradictory impulses in the moment. The sister relationship is potent but mostly functions as premise rather than an on-page relational crucible under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both the narrator and Lio are sharply etched: her ambivalent burden as “root-bound visionary” and his principled skepticism create real friction, especially when he presses for proof yet still submits his scar. The internal conflict—reverence/fear of the maze vs responsibility to guide Lio—is credible and embodied (roots drawing blood, scars glowing). Their relationship clearly evolves into a crucible where trust and doubt are mutually tested. The only slight limit is that we glimpse, rather than fully inhabit, how this specific choice will permanently alter their bond.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt and yearning “to become someone who would have stayed and watched the water” are specific, embodied, and drive every on-page choice, while Lio’s mix of recklessness and tenderness feels sharply individuated. The relationship dynamic—his dangerous compassion versus their neediness—creates a quiet but potent crucible. Internal conflict is present but mostly front-loaded; once the ritual begins, the narrator becomes more witness than active decider. The final shift to “I steadier” is earned, but could land even harder if one more concrete hesitation or contrary impulse surfaced during the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eli’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete memories (the torn grille cloth, the bus for sale online), and his mix of denial, longing, and self-protection feels earned. His choices—taking this job, how he writes the provenance line—track cleanly with his shame over the livestream failure and his history on tour. Contradictory impulses (clinging to facts vs. being knocked into memory) are dramatized rather than labeled. The final small choice on the form is a credible, costly adjustment in how he relates to his past, not a cheap epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation (intellectual curiosity vs. “haunted ambitions”) is sharply rendered, and her final line reads as a credible, earned stance rather than a neat epiphany. Her perception is highly individualized (using linguistic/translation frames for everything), and her fear/curiosity mix feels embodied in the way she processes the arbor’s changes. The internal conflict between fame and ethical responsibility is on the page at the end, not just implied. The only minor limit is that we don’t see quite as much emotional degradation or loss of composure under extreme stress as an elite piece might push toward.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The titan-gear librarian is sharply drawn, with a clear ethic (“to preserve wonder in routine”) that governs how they handle the creel and the fisherman. Their internal contradiction—mechanical, methodical, yet committed to improvisational wonder—is dramatized via the smelting choice. The fisherman is sketched more lightly but still reads as specific through details like “three different gazes at once” and his panic about waking into yesterday. The final mutual borrowing of features in the reflection is a strong crystallization of their shared, shifting identities.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and coherent: her professional rigor, accumulated disillusionment, and quiet longing to do more than “certify tombs” all align with her eventual confession. Her micro-choices—following this odd assignment, stepping toward the pearl, letting the clipboard hang—embody that conflict. The internal arc from detached inspector to someone risking self-indictment feels earned. A minor drawback is the slightly expository phrasing of her deepest desire (“to dissolve the walls between hearts”), which tells a bit more baldly than the rest of the piece shows.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s guilt, self-justification, and curiosity are in constant tension, with concrete embodiments (the recorder, the award, the brother’s accordion) grounding that conflict. Micro-choices—entering the bathroom, touching the tape, picking up the accordion, choosing what to log—feel motivated and reveal a hierarchy of values. The reconfiguration at the end (writing both names, changing how he records the scene) is clearly earned and carries cost. The only slight limitation is that the brother remains entirely retrospective, so the relational crucible is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The veiled dreamer’s mix of “cautious exuberance” and principled doubt is consistently dramatized in embodied ways (the vibrating unwritten letter, the chain-dragging sense when she imagines ink). Her central renunciation—choosing not to document and dissolving her resignation letter—feels earned by her growing reverence for what must remain unresolved. The relationship with the gatekeeper is economical but live; his watch and silence apply real pressure to her outlook. If anything, I’d like one slightly sharper moment of flinch or self-deception to complicate her near-immediate moral assimilation to the library’s ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives are clear and layered: professional integrity, fascination with myth, and a hunger “to weigh a dream against an empire” all pull against career pressure. Internal conflict is dramatized in concrete beats (plant gossip, coffee reading, contract in hand), not just asserted. Aurelio’s status play and “practiced tenderness” provide a functional crucible without turning him into a caricature. The final refusal and annotated margins feel fully earned by the prior ambivalence and carry a visible cost in reputation and opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s vocation, sensory habits, and the specific tenderness of her work make her feel precise and lived-in, and her history with Isren gives the climax genuine emotional weight. Her motivation is cleanly rooted in both professional ethic and private attachment. The inner conflict at the end (professionally steady vs. personally shaken) is implied more than dramatized, so contradictory impulses don’t fully peak on the page. Still, her choices consistently express a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caretaker’s motivation and flaw are sharply drawn: she over-identifies with service and wants contentment as a “reward,” which the grotto exposes. Interiority is specific and embodied (“knees” unsteady, vineyard hush in her bones), and her vision of other lives (including as her own brother) deepens conflict rather than simplifying it. The final change—re-seeing caretaking as one season in a larger cycle—feels earned by prior beats. A minor limitation is that her kindly decisiveness is more summarized via villagers’ opinion than dramatized under real-time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation and interior stance (“conscience for hire,” “keep certainty on the hook”) feel specific and psychologically credible, and Mara’s guilt around the storm choice is sharply etched. Their conflicting desires—Mara’s hunger for a verdict vs. the narrator’s commitment to ambiguity—play out through concrete micro-choices in the dialogue. Emotional states are embodied via setting (“some people never truly sleep once regret moves in,” her hugging her arms) rather than labeled. The final softening of Mara’s shoulders and the narrator’s open coat makes the endurance-with-cost feel earned rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian and Mora both have clear, particular motives—his cautious, ethically fraught teaching versus her hunger for spectacle—and their dynamic is well-drawn in very little space. Mora’s internal conflict (desire to vanish vs fear of not returning) is strongly implied but only lightly dramatized in embodied detail. Elian’s backward aging and long history of loss add depth but mostly as atmosphere rather than pressures on an in-scene choice. The final charged moment—Mora tasting the possibility of not returning—feels earned, though her value hierarchy could be even sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harmonic stone skimmer’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with his disciplines, tools, and perceptions all revealing a coherent, idiosyncratic mind. His motivation—to fix this “pulse left wandering” and learn to navigate without moving—is clear and drives every on-page choice. The earned stasis at the end (choosing stillness as method rather than default) feels motivated by all that precedes it. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under pressure is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see active struggle between competing impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orren is sharply sketched as a failed, sidelined mage whose humiliation and displacement by machines clearly fuel his restlessness; images like his thoughts “curled up like burned paper” feel specific and earned. His fear of falling and obedience to regulations are in real tension with the impulse to follow the keystone and step into mist. The final choice to break rules and risk himself is well prepared by his history with failure and the devaluation of his work. The only slight weakness is that his deeper longing for meaning is partly told rather than fully dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive (color of sound), core flaw (hiding behind truth), and internal shift at the vow are all sharply rendered and consistent. The line “He, who hid behind truth, had never dared to promise anything…” crystallizes his psychology and makes the final vow feel earned. Emotional texture is embodied through action (diving, swimming, pressing his hand to his chest) rather than label-speak. The only slight limitation is how smoothly the realization arrives; it skirts feeling a touch too clean for such a deep-seated fear.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s role as cast-lots decision maker, their attachment to that function, and their “stellar doubt” are sharply realized and consistent. The internal conflict between comfort in randomness and terror of full agency is clear and culminates in the choice to stop casting. Tamsin’s characterization is lighter but still distinct, functioning as a foil whose curiosity reframes fear. If anything, the emotional cost of renouncing the role could use one more concrete, bodily beat right at the moment of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reaper’s motivation is specific and consistent—penitent, shifting from harvest to witnessing—and anchored in the concrete backstory of the child’s sacrifice. His interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, especially the image of his chest as “a hollow instrument forever playing that single, distant note of regret.” Internal contradiction (former executioner turned archivist of fear) is present but largely settled rather than tested in-scene, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier. The final hope for the boy feels earned and grows logically from his earlier regret and tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tamsin’s characterization is vivid, particular, and consistent: the “lukewarm mage” with a useless-seeming gift, brittle faith, and “naivete with teeth” is rendered through choices and perceptions rather than labels alone. Her motivation—both to fix the bell and to safeguard her belief in cosmic fairness—is clearly tied to prior humiliations. The tension between knowing this is “the sort of error a more talented mage would never make” and doing it anyway gives her a live internal contradiction. Her final choice to let the bell finish its note feels earned and costly on the scale of the piece because it risks the shattering of that thin, hardened devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tomas’s grief, professional vigilance, and belief in “structures that held” give him a distinct interior life, and his shift from engineer-warden to reluctant storyteller is well earned. The photos and label elicit specific, embodied reactions rather than generic sadness, and his final choice to address the crowd with a story rather than warnings feels like a meaningful, costly reorientation. The one slightly on-the-nose line about “stories into shared meaning” edges toward thematic articulation, but it’s still grounded in his lived experience. Overall, the characterization is deep and coherent across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s interior conflict between cold precision and buried sentiment is rendered with specificity and embodied in concrete choices, especially his decision to pivot the lens by feel rather than calculation. His motivation—to reconcile logic and intuition before an ominous “final transformation”—is clear and consistently pressures his tactics. The emotional progression from guarded detachment to openly weeping at the crystal’s blooming feels earned and not over-tidy. The only tiny limitation is that no other on-page character or relationship stresses him, so his crucible is purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interior life is specific, embodied, and consistent—the anger flare, inherited duty, and hesitation around filing the report create credible tension under pressure. Motivation is clear and scaled to the task, and the endurance of the burden by the end feels earned rather than declared. The main cost is quiet but legible: she chooses decisive action knowing she will receive no recognition and may always doubt her timing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Arin’s numbness and desire “to defeat emotional numbness” cleanly drive his choices, especially his shift from parrying to refusing to erase guilt. His internal conflict—wanting to win yet not by hollowing Arin-2—is dramatized in the memory duel rather than explained. Arin-2 is thinner but still legible as a faster, resentful echo whose tactics contrast with the narrator’s. The final renunciation (keeping guilt) feels earned and carries a visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives—curiosity, professional pride, and a desire to protect a non-touristy space—are clear and specific, and his choice to plant the seed feels earned by his established receptiveness. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“notably receptive”; mining player frustration for mechanics). The internal conflict between caution (stench, unknown sender) and attraction to strangeness is present, if understated. The final reorientation of his escape room as “an entrance instead” credibly extends from his earlier values rather than reading as a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lysander’s grief, ritualistic creativity, and “mournfully eager” drive are vivid and specific, and his choice to orchestrate this bizarre concert is fully motivated by the established loss. His interiority is mostly carried through image and action rather than direct thought, but the tuning-fork metaphor and the months of leaf-sweeping rehearsals clarify his psychology. The parents function more as pressured presences than as developed characters, but their brief on-page reactions are emotionally credible and matter to his goal. The final realization—that tending to the unspoken is endless—feels earned and rooted in what we’ve seen him do.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the narrator’s dimensional homesickness and attraction to uncertainty feel deeply rooted, and the guardian’s feral suspicion is sharply drawn. Micro-choices—sitting on the bench, reaching for the pendant, articulating “I will wait while moving”—all arise credibly from prior traits. The internal contradiction between craving “home” and choosing an uncertain corridor is present on the page and informs the final stance. The only minor limit is that we see a crystallization more than a hard-renunciation with concrete price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corren’s motivation is clear and specific—refusing the role of “anonymous workshop ghost” drives every choice, culminating in redirecting the crozier’s power. Interiority is textured and embodied (“carrying failure like another cracked vial,” “heart a percussion of doubt under trained indifference”), with a credible mix of shame, defiance, and fear. His core contradiction—hopeless yet still acting, sensitive yet “refusing to admit it drew any blood”—is present on the page and informs his tactics. The only limit is that his flaw (habitual deference) isn’t tested by any active opposition, so his change faces less on-page resistance than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, worldview, and temperament are sharply etched and consistently enacted, especially in the compromise between the city’s longing for destruction and the valley’s safety. Motivation—to find “the beginning in every ending”—is not just told but dramatized in how they listen for rehearsals of farewells. Internal conflict is present but subtle: a pull toward honoring the towers’ suicidal wish versus a responsibility to living people. The final stance feels earned and carries a visible cost in deferred, managed dissolution rather than cathartic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli is sharply etched: his “quiet miracle” of always returning, priest-like caretaking of the ferry, and studied belief in the radio’s lattice make his final attempt feel motivated. His optimism against the “tingling in his teeth” gives him a credible internal tension without over-explaining. Secondary passengers are more emblematic than dimensional, but they work as pressures and mirrors rather than full characters. His choice at the end (“He chose home.”) is earned, though the cost is more implied than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—“a way to remember someone without hurting”—is vivid, consistent, and complicated by her clear unwillingness to let go of pain entirely. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“felt like anesthesia for the soul”), not abstract. The architect’s “professional reluctance” and rule-bound attention to tension and structure give him a distinct, pressuring presence. The final choice to bind the thread without stepping through or fleeing reads as earned stasis with a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation is clear and specific—torn between exhaustion, duty, and a deep longing for starlight—and the micro-choice to meet Mirror is credibly rooted in that tension (“the chain link clinked softly against my ribs”). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, filtered through a navigator’s sensibility rather than generic emotion labels. The relationship with Mirror carries a quiet status dynamic (the human as student who nonetheless brings something aliens value) that sharpens by the end when he asks to be taught. The closing stance—accepting a role as “navigation instructor between worlds”—reads as an earned reconfiguration with a conceptual cost: relinquishing a simpler, pole-star worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eren’s blend of bureaucratic role and almost devotional curiosity is sharply drawn, and his final choice to break protocol is clearly rooted in that trait. Interiority is specific (“what they had almost said”), not generic, and we see him weigh caseload and rules against the need to honor one voice. This is a quiet arc, but the endurance of his flaw/virtue—persistently curious, unable to just log and leave—reads as earned stasis with cost. A touch more embodied emotional contradiction in the final phone call could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Noah’s motives are clear and specific—professional pragmatism, buried need to “stand by the unremembered,” and crippling claustrophobia all inform his choices. Interiority is textured (“Rock was honest; steel remembered collapse”) and embodied enough that his fear feels personal rather than generic. The core contradiction between getting paid and honoring the dead is present, but the peak choice—turning back with the sphere—is resolved a bit briskly, with limited on-page wrestling. That slight softening at the end keeps the characterization from feeling fully maximized at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s grief, guilt, and obsessive heartbeat-counting create a rich, specific interiority, and his final shift from preserving the old Lian to co-authoring a new one feels earned. Micro-choices (staying on despite being “dead,” brewing tea, wiping notes, deciding to rewrite the code) all align with his motives under pressure. The contradiction between his hyper-control (counting) and his willingness to risk a new algorithm under time and power strain is especially strong. A slight limitation is that Lian’s on-page presence is mostly conceptual until the final lines, so the relationship’s dynamic under pressure is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storyteller’s vocation and relationship to texture, sound, and the diamond are very clear and consistent, and his final acceptance of being braided into the language feels earned. However, internal contradiction is muted: he never seriously wavers between self-preservation and the urge to preserve the language, so pressure on his values is more implied than dramatized. Embodied emotion is present but tends to be subsumed into the lyrical description rather than sharply conflicted impulses on the page. The result is strong but slightly too serene for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s blend of professional detachment and involuntary awe is specific and consistent, and their horror at “They turn into this” versus Mara’s correction shows real internal conflict. Motivation (to do reconnaissance for the institute) stays legible even as their understanding shifts, and micro-choices—what they notice, whether to challenge Mara—reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatized, but the implied foreclosure of a simple “threat map” mindset is earned. Mara is vivid and pressure-bearing, though her own stakes could be sharpened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio’s motivation (reawaken beauty vs being used as social control) is clear and drives his key choice to align with the orchard, but his inner conflict is more implied than dramatized. We don’t see substantial contradictory impulses in scene—once the shell appears, he shifts to the new rhythm with little hesitation or fear. His embodied experience (aching arms, rhythm under his skin) is good but relatively spare given the upheaval he’s causing. The final step onto the bough feels earned yet emotionally under-interrogated, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eren and Mara are sharply sketched with specific traits (respectfully rebellious, healer with jars of herbs and circuit boards) and clear motives, and the mailman’s oath at his sister’s grave nicely deepens him. Their dynamic—the cautious ritualized respect, mutual risk—feels lived-in and shapes their micro-choices. Internal contradiction is present (Eren’s deference vs. quiet defiance; Mara’s healer’s caution vs. temptation to unleash the storm) but mostly implied rather than fully dramatized in a peak moment. The main limitation is that we never quite see a concrete, on-page cost or irreversible choice from either—closure leans into charged poise rather than a felt renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eli’s interiority is specific and grounded in work—his identity as a repairer, his fear of what comes after music ends, and his longing to reinterpret silence all feel cohesive. His key choice (to sing, then to work) grows credibly from his history of fixing carousels instead of himself. The internal shift from fear/constriction to tentative openness is clear, if somewhat gently rendered. There’s room for a sharper moment of contradictory impulse under pressure to fully enter top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mariel is sharply etched—methodical, “sanely eccentric,” with concrete habits like the scarf and hyperbolic diagrams that make her feel particular rather than stock. Her motivation (locating where stories live) is clear and consistently pursued. Internal contradiction is present but mild: the meticulous mapper who discovers the answer is in a simple human posture, not geometry. The emotional cost of that realization is more implied than deeply felt, which keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Irena’s interiority is vivid, specific, and rooted in a clear blend of duty (vitalizing the archive) and personal longing (the runaway dream/vanished librarian). Her emotional texture—feeling hollowed by each sunrise, sensing the villagers’ silence as a “catalog”—feels particular rather than generic. However, the story stops just short of dramatizing a sharp internal contradiction at the climax; the last ascent to the cliff is an extension of her pattern rather than a pressured new choice. The endurance/cost is implied more than actively confronted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clean and compresses into a strong, particular drive (“simple courage to let my own idea breathe”), and the internal contradiction between longing and fear is embodied in images like the “clenched fist” of fear. The mother’s hair and death ground the protagonist’s block in lived history rather than abstract neurosis. The locksmith’s characterization remains intentionally opaque yet still exerts credible pressure. The final act—thanking fear and asking it to step aside—feels earned, though we only glimpse, not fully inhabit, the messy aftershock of that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular—“nostalgia came then, not as warmth but as a crisp tightening in my chest” grounds emotion in body and image, and the folklorist’s blend of professionalism and longing is consistent. The motive to recover memories is clear and credibly tied to their chronic curiosity and aging. The internal conflict between a “tidy life and a complete one” is well staged at the climax, with a visible cost in cognitive fraying. A slightly more dramatized struggle at the moment of committing to stay in the ring (rather than sliding into it) could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhea’s characterization is rich and specific—“combative tenderness” is consistently dramatized in her argument with the Council (summarized) and especially in her sharp but caring interaction with Jun. Jun’s defiance overlaying fear (“ran out of places to run”) gives them texture beyond a stock rebel. The final promise (“I will hold the exit open…” / “forgetting me will hurt”) crystallizes their relationship and Rhea’s values with a clear cost. A minor limitation is that Jun’s interiority is mostly inferred rather than directly embodied, keeping them slightly thinner than Rhea.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior is sharply etched—his patience, gentle authority, and vocation embody the piece’s ethos—and his choices (inviting the narrator in, offering the seed, teaching the ritual) clearly drive the scene. The narrator’s arc from numbness to tentative hope is convincing but somewhat streamlined, with limited contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment. Their “insatiably creative heart” is asserted more than deeply proved on the page, though the imagined revival of the city helps. Emotional reactions are mostly embodied through sensory perception rather than label-speak, which keeps the interiority grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilan’s vocation, his history with his brother’s death, and his quiet compulsion to say yes to the old woman give him a distinct, wounded integrity. His motivation to ground spirits is clear and consistent, and the moment of hesitation at the final knot shows a real micro-choice with potential cost. Internal conflict is present but subtle; he is never truly tempted to refuse, so we don’t see much contradictory impulse under pressure. Still, for this length the emotional specificity and earned final softening feel strong and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched through the map-framing vocation, “methodical curiosity,” and his anxiety about the “millimeter he had removed,” which credibly motivates his attraction to the anomaly and to Mara’s request. His guardedness versus openness is dramatized in micro-choices (taking the commission before fully understanding it, agreeing to watch, then advocating a specific, ethically inflected reopening). Emotional embodiment is mostly via perception and metaphor rather than bodily sensation, but it remains character-specific rather than generic. The internal shift—from technical consultant to someone arguing the chapel is a listener with claims on human behavior—feels earned, if understated in visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent—“on a first name basis with death” and “measures panic in heartbeats per minute” gives a clear, embodied psychology. Motivation for diving and for respecting the dead is well-rooted and credibly tested by the physicist’s experiment. The internal conflict between analytical detachment and emotional fraying under pressure is convincing. The one slight weakness is that the exact nature of the final “compromise that felt like mourning” remains conceptual rather than dramatized, softening the sense of a concrete, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s motivation (to give voice to unspoken needs despite crippling shyness) is clear, consistent, and drives his choices from copper-dust preparation to offering himself as conduit. Interiority is specific and embodied (“throat tight, feeling every unsung verse in him lean forward to listen”) rather than abstract. There is some internal friction—yearning to speak vs fear of being heard—but it could be pushed a notch harder at the peak for a more jagged, costly-feeling decision. Overall, the final choice to say “Use me” is earned and character-rooted, if emotionally a bit smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Etta’s motives are clear, specific, and consistent, and her internal logic—curiosity plus a servant’s cautiousness—drives every action from stealing the key to how she “consoles” the lock. The realization at the diary that pain must be annotated with surviving joys is a credible, earned shift rather than a bolt-on epiphany. However, her flaws are somewhat muted: she reads as almost purely gentle and perceptive, with little messiness or self-deception under peak pressure. The cost of her change (remaining a servant but with new perception) could be shaded with a bit more ambivalence to deepen character contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is specific, grounded in her vocation and grief, and her motive—to test whether “empty spaces remember”—credibly drives her choice to remain in the gondola and to treat it as laboratory and memorial. The meteorologist lens colors what she notices (cloud typologies, shear layers) in a character-particular way. Internal contradiction (scientist vs. mourner) is present but could sharpen into more active friction in the moment; she rarely wavers or errs under pressure. The final endurance choice (letting the broken space carry her) feels earned but could carry a more explicit sense of risk or self-betrayal for true top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and grounded in sensory habits—knowing books “by spine and smell,” treating faces as “constellations”—and her prosopagnosia is dramatized rather than merely labeled. Her central motive (to mirror the sky inside walls) coheres with her professional life and with this last act. The decisive moment—stopping when there is no more space and reconceiving limits as frames—feels earned by what we’ve seen. The only slight weakness is that her emotional conflict with the impending loss of the tree remains more implied than directly tested in an on-page choice beyond the painting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s motivation—curiosity plus the desire to vindicate his mother—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted in the hopscotch investigations and the confrontation with Orvan. The interiority feels lived-in through details like “collected rumors like stamps,” giving him a distinct temperament rather than a stock “chosen one.” The relationship with Orvan has clear status dynamics and a subtle shift when Orvan acknowledges “madness or the beginning of a new discipline.” The only limiter is that Lio’s internal conflict (risk vs duty / respect for Orvan) is implied more than directly pressured, so the final choice carries slightly less felt cost than it might.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s desire “to learn the rhythm of repair” is clear and drives the entire encounter with the library and the mirrors. Interiority is vivid and particular (the “borrowed” breath, “driftwood” nostalgia), but we don’t see much true internal contradiction or a pressured choice with visible cost; the locksmith is essentially always aligned with their purpose. The micro-choices with each mirror are deft but largely variations on one mode rather than a deepening moral or emotional conflict. The ending implies quiet fatigue and longing more than an earned renunciation, keeping this just shy of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kerran’s motivation—to keep organizing for others even after death—is clear, specific, and carried consistently from petitions in life to chalk routes in death. Interiority is brief but sharp (“that sentence loosened something I had tightened around my own memory of drowning in hospital light”), giving a felt contradiction between past despair and present usefulness. Micro-choices under pressure (what to write, when to urge them to move now, what to prioritize) reveal a value hierarchy without speechifying. The main limitation is that Kerran’s internal conflict stays relatively subtle; we see more competence and purpose than real struggle with doubt or selfish impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The adjuster’s grief, defiance, and narrowed but stubborn mercy are specific and consistent, with the puppet and the ash-child giving him a lived, non-generic past. His choice to substitute the puppet head for the master key is clearly motivated yet morally ambiguous—he refuses the mandate to “save the world” in favor of softening its end. Interiority stays embodied and particular (“bruised awe,” time thrumming like a trapped bird) rather than abstract. The only minor limitation is that his internal contradiction (duty vs. lullaby) could surface a hair more explicitly under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s motivation (unwanted obligation to guide travelers against a sentient “blueprint”) is vivid, consistent, and generates credible ambivalence across years. Interiority is concrete and particular (“bleeding hope,” the nut burning in his pocket) with a strong sense of flaw—he keeps guiding despite knowing many paths end in “gradations of ruin.” His endurance feels like Earned Stasis, especially in the line “My curse was not the orchard itself but the obligation to read that invisible plan and defy it.” The only limiter at this length is that the final decision with the last traveler is implied but not dramatized into a fully felt turn on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s guilt, scientific mindset, and music-inflected perception mesh into a specific, convincing interior life, and her return to the station plus the reimagined resin feel cleanly motivated by that mix. The tension between atonement and ongoing curiosity is present without being over-explained. Her final stance—relief rather than triumph, guilt loosening rather than vanishing—reads as an earned reconfiguration with a visible cost. If anything, the piece could show one sharper moment where her self-punishing impulse actively conflicts with her drive to keep experimenting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The vendor’s interiority is specific and textured—his uncertainty about being a “person,” his shelved memories, and his ambivalence toward the instructions all feel distinct and motivated. The woman is sketched efficiently but credibly through her “fatigue of too many identities” and her explicit wish for “the silence before the opening word.” Their shared desire for a different kind of beginning motivates the central choice and makes the final signing feel earned rather than arbitrary. The main limitation is that their internal contradictions under peak pressure are suggested more conceptually than viscerally embodied, keeping this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rafi’s interiority is specific and embodied—his avoidance of touch, his bracing against the coral, and his calibration of “three grains” of remorse all reveal a deeply etched, quietly tormented professional. His motivation to make pain bearable is clear and consistently drives choices. The internal contradiction between his “sturdy brittle calm” and the vulnerability of being flooded by others’ memories is compelling, though we get slightly more of his function than of his personal, idiosyncratic history. The final endurance—continuing in his role despite cumulative cost—reads as an earned stasis rather than a hollow pose.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vocation and motivation (“construct bridges from silos”) are clear, consistent, and beautifully embedded in her actions with the elevator and choirs. Her decisiveness under pressure—recruiting others, mediating design disputes—aligns with the setup without feeling contrived. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction or doubt under strain; she rarely wavers, so internal conflict feels muted. The change by the end is more in the world than in her, which slightly limits the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s motivation is precise and consistent—an engineer who wants to become “the archeologist of abandoned dreams”—and his core conflict between stabilizing the system versus surrendering to it is clearly dramatized. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (helix metaphors, engineer’s instinct vs new ambition), with embodied reactions (tingling interface, tears, tremors). His final choice to become the archive himself is well earned by the preceding beats. The only limit is that his flaws and blind spots (fear of finishing, avoidance) could surface more actively in moment-to-moment resistance before he yields.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—curiosity sharpened into vigilance—is clear and coherent, and his training as “prism-minded” feels particular rather than generic. However, his interior conflict is relatively low-friction: there’s little sense of competing impulses or doubt once the journey begins. The choice to read and accept the combinations feels natural but not heavily contested on the page. The change at the end (carrying the safeguards in his mind) is earned but emotionally underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s motivation and method are clear, particular, and embodied—his “empathy in motion” belief and obsessive reading of cracks and branches feel genuinely his. The relationship with Ina is economical but effective: her skepticism, bodily attunement, and signing give him a human counterpoint rather than a prop. What’s missing for the very top tier is real internal contradiction or a hard trade-off under pressure; he never meaningfully doubts, fails, or pays a visible emotional price beyond exhaustion. The final realization is earned but a bit straightforward given how little his self-concept is challenged.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Oren’s interiority is rich and particular, with his exile, guilt, pedagogical ethic, and loyalty to the boy all cohering into a distinct psyche. His key choice—to negotiate a gentler reshaping of the covenant rather than attempt to erase it—is clearly motivated by those traits and his history across the chessboard. The embodied details (teeth aching, thumb on the stone) support emotion without generic labeling. The one limit is that contradiction under peak pressure stays mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s motives, contradictions, and vows are sharply etched: his pacifism emerges as a fragile, hard-won excavation rather than a label, and his refusal to break the clasp concretizes that. The guilt around Mira and the shouted argument is visceral and particular, not generic backstory. His final act—opening the diary only after a reframed understanding of empathy—feels fully earned and costly. Interiority stays embodied and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are vivid and specific: her ambition and fear “braided tight like the cords” play simultaneously through the council confrontation and the climb. Her olfactory way of seeing the world roots her interiority in concrete perception. The relationship with Maru has clear status dynamics, and his reluctant surrender refracts who she is rather than flattening into approval. The only mild limitation is that her flaw—difficulty with quiet—has not yet exacted an on-page cost beyond being named.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s motivation—to understand the orchards’ impossible resilience—is clear, consistent with his history of witnessing planetary ruin, and drives his choice to retrofit the glider and breach the forbidden high groves. His interiority is vivid in sensory terms (wind on eyelids, echoes in bones) but we get little true internal conflict or contradictory impulse; he mostly moves in steady awe and curiosity. The final realization feels earned by prior observations but doesn’t force a visibly costly renunciation or fracture in him. This keeps the characterization strong but short of fully transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator’s professional mindset and habits (reading silence “like instruments,” starting with the air over logs) feel specific and consistent, and the patch anchors a quietly elegiac emotional throughline. Motivation (preventing future disasters via “cultivat[ing] foresight in action”) is clear and holds through the end. Internal conflict is mostly implicit—there’s a faint tension between superstition and rational method, but not a fully dramatized contradiction under pressure. The final stance (“for tonight, it was enough…”) reads earned, but the cost is more tonal than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ilen’s vocation, fear that “the world might no longer notice when silence changed,” and disciplined stillness give him a distinct, coherent psychology. His synesthetic perception is integrated into his interiority rather than a label. The arc is more an earned endurance than a sharp change, but his closing acceptance of duty as completed and necessary feels motivated. The only limit is that the emotional cost of this vigilance stays mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cael’s motives and contradictions are sharply drawn: peace as exile, duty as both vocation and wound, and his need to “harvest insights from failure” all cohere. Interiority is specific and embodied (“stone in his throat,” his reaction to the boy’s grief) rather than labeled. The final choice—to play a simple, imperfect note as an offering rather than a command—feels fully earned by the prior rethinking of his relationship to the flute. The only thing that keeps this just shy of top-tier is that his flaws (e.g., control, rigidity) are more implied than concretely dramatized in on-page past behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation (to “solve” an unsolvable feeling; to reframe grief) is clear and consistently enacted, and their interiority is vivid and particular (“the word felt like a drawer everyone rummaged through”). Contradictory impulses—rational arithmetic vs. surrender to ambiguity—are present but could be surfaced more sharply in the moment of choosing to touch the halo. Mara is compelling and specific but remains more function/tool than fully pressured character; her own stakes never quite come into focus. The closing reconfiguration of the narrator’s grief feels earned, though the forward cost is more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courier’s interiority is specific and embodied—his jitteriness, the carbonated-water sensation, his repeated touching of the pendant anchor him as a distinct person with a credible nervous system. His vocation and Ralen’s rule clearly motivate his choices (taking lonely routes, handling relics as “bag of ghosts”), and the final decision to “stay a little longer everywhere” feels earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he clings to routine yet is drawn to destabilizing wonder and to re-opening connections he’s previously kept brief. The only limit is that we never see him under sharper relational pressure with another on-page character, so his flaws aren’t stress-tested interpersonally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mystic’s motivation (“to prove, once and for all, that objects absorb emotions”) is clear and drives each choice: going to the quarry, then to the car, then door to door. Interiority is vivid and particular—“responsible liar,” the sigh about the diner, the blend of scientific ambition and mystical receptivity. However, internal contradiction under pressure never quite crystallizes into a truly costly choice; social and ethical risk is implied more than dramatized. The arc feels like a deepening of stance rather than a turn that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nari’s motivation—refusing to accept her brother’s disappearance and needing a medium that outlasts words—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices. Her emotional life is embodied through tactile relationships to thread, bead, and loom rather than label-words. The final sacrifice of the tapestry is well-earned by the decade of weaving and the puzzle’s revealed nature. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page hesitation or contradictory impulses at the moment of sacrifice, which could sharpen her internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corren’s meekness and quiet determination are embodied in specific behaviors (shoulders “apologizing,” trading repairs for stories, descending into forbidden shafts) rather than labels. His motivation—to make things resilient again—is clear and consistently drives his choices. Internal contradiction (fear vs. determination, doubt vs. craft-faith) is present but could be rendered more explicitly in a moment of hesitation or cost at the mine’s most dangerous beat. The change at the end (from tentative experimenter to someone who has actually altered the world’s terms) feels earned but could carry more visible personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s motives and flaw are clear and particular: a gifted navigator of others’ uncertainties who has chronically outsourced his own life direction. His shift from mapping for clients to “mapping yourself” feels earned by the Archivist’s pressure and the corridor of alternate selves, not tacked-on. The body/emotional stakes of that shift are present in images of weight, pressure, and repetition, even if a touch more embodied fear or resistance during the corridor passage could deepen the cost. The Archivist is sketched efficiently as a weary, higher-status figure whose repeated line hints at long-running, strained involvement.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is sharply etched through restrained but specific interiority: his reticence, practical skepticism, and habitual noticing all feed directly into his choices (rearranging stones, lingering over the letters, deciding to write his own). The contradiction between “not believing in ghosts” and still altering the spiral and trembling at the door plays well. His final decision to step into a quasi-keeper/protector role feels earned from his history of unnoticed service. The only limitation is that his flaw set (reticence, modesty) is gestured at more than directly tested in on-page confrontation with other people.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orrin is sharply etched: nostalgic, bitterly funny, and stubbornly dutiful, with the “accidentally prophetic” trait grounded in concrete past examples. His emotional throughline—from static-tinged shiver to “shadowed elation” to steadier joy—is coherent and character-specific, if more intellectualized than bodily. The final choice to “take the helm” and accept steering a new kind of dawn feels earned by his long routine and earlier oath, with a real cost in relinquishing pure nostalgia. A touch more embodied contradiction (fear vs desire in the decision moment) would push this toward full mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dye master’s motivation (to understand why some people “magnetize stories”) is clear, specific, and governs his choices to question the patrons and finally reveal the wing. His interiority is vivid and embodied through the donor heart and dye metaphors, with a credible tension between caution and curiosity. Secondary characters are sketched economically but distinctly in how they relate to stories. The change at the end—a reconfiguration of what “magnetizing stories” means—is earned, though the felt cost of that insight remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Milo’s motives—attunement to the labyrinth, quiet curiosity, and his long-standing wish to know what trees witness—are clear and specific, and his choices (taking the sextant, going to the roof, using it on trees) organically follow from them. The characterization is textured (he listens “between the drips and drafts,” talks more to trees than people), and his maintenance-worker competence grounds the fantastical elements. The internal arc is quieter: his shift from maintenance of stone to maintenance of sorrow/forgiveness is implied rather than sharply dramatized, so the cost of that turn is soft. A bit more embodied tension or ambivalence in the decision to keep and use the sextant could deepen the sense of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation and history are clear and specific—she believes in mercy as erasure and must now reverse that choice, which gives her final act weight. The oath to both hold and return memories grounds her decision at the climax. Internal conflict (guilt, fear of hurting people by waking them) is present but mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in the moment. A bit more embodied doubt or resistance right before she sings could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is sharply drawn: his mix of compulsive caretaking, avoidance, and buried guilt underpins every choice, and the pivot to finally “stay” feels causally earned by the voicemail re-hearing. The brother backstory is integrated enough that the overdose reads as a specific failure, not a generic tragedy. His micro-choices (saving the old phone, polishing the key, hiding shaking hands) all cohere. Mara is more archetypal but functions cleanly as a pressure agent rather than a full co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, self-accusation, and compulsion to “notice” are dramatized cleanly through his choices around the bread and the tea house, and the tea mistress’s reserved, precise interventions sharpen his conflict without softening him. His contradictory impulses—clinging to the loaf as penance vs. wanting a purpose for it—are active in scene and culminate in the shared eating. The final “slight adjustment in his posture” reads as earned stasis rather than easy absolution. I might want one slightly sharper moment of embodied stress or irrationality from him under pressure to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Serin’s motives—professional obligation, inherited myth about Object Zero, and a “quiet, almost shameful” hunger for meaning—are clearly established and credibly drive his final choice to amend the vows. His interiority remains concrete and character-specific (e.g., “another layer of frost” on his shoulders), with embodied anxiety in breath, cuffs, and nervous system. The internal conflict between preserving protocol and honoring the founders’ true loneliness could be stressed a little more viscerally at the decision point. Still, the choice to braid his own vow through theirs is earned and forecloses the comfort of mere maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Loretta’s motivations are vivid and particular—moonshine runner’s daughter, hunger to hear what others hide—and her choice to pay dearly to relive her father’s betrayal feels earned. The internal contradiction between wanting the truth and fearing its pain is embodied in beats like her stagger when the fob plays the moment back. Her relationship with the father, though off-page, is sharply sketched through details like knowing his real name and how he wore his knife. The only slight limitation is that we don’t see her value hierarchy tested against any competing external demand; it all orients around the same wound.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motives (skepticism, desire to understand weather-bearers, resistance to being “more” than luminous) are clear, and their shift from denial to acceptance at the end feels earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory focus, especially taste and light. The three weather-carriers are more archetypal than individuated, but they still function effectively as pressure rather than props. The final non-verbal answer underlines a real internal change with a legible cost: relinquishing pure doubt for a role in a heavy, archival duty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is precise and layered: guilt over Mara, resentment toward the manager, and fear of his own calling all braid into the decision to finish the portrait. His charcoal-stained body, mnemonic gift, and obsessive perception of faces ground him as an individual rather than a type. The internal contradiction—vowing never to finish Mara yet compelled to do exactly that—is dramatized rather than merely stated. The final act of both completing and then re-concealing the drawing reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s values and motives are vivid and consistent—his physical reaction to dishonesty and reverence for truthful words feel specific and embodied. His choice to follow the map and open the observatory doors is clearly motivated by his obsession with “lost conversations,” though internal contradiction (fear vs compulsion) is only lightly sketched. The occupational detail (gilded-leaf calligrapher for living vines) meaningfully colors his perceptions and actions. What’s missing for the very top tier is a sharper on-page clash between competing impulses at the moment of departure or entry.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio is vivid and specific in craft and temperament, and the seasonal muteness is a strong, character-shaped constraint. His micro-choices (accepting the shard, choosing nonverbal preservation over explanation) are clearly motivated and coherent. However, interior contradiction remains fairly gentle and abstract; we don’t see him genuinely torn so much as serenely aligned with his role. The girl is mostly a catalyst rather than a fully pressured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The android’s motives (resolve static, manage nostalgia, protect the roses) are clear and consistent, and his choice to risk the farm for an internal “controlled burn” feels earned. Interiority is specific and character-particular (“monsters had become his nostalgia,” checksum knowledge of fears). There’s some implied contradiction—caretaker vs. saboteur—that plays out credibly in his tactical, almost clinical approach. Emotional embodiment is largely metaphorical rather than visceral, but it suits his machine perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation—curating the shop like a “museum of second chances” and resisting development through listening—is clear and consistently expressed in action (dawn circles, orchestrating the mailbox mystery). Her “sandstorm calm” and choice to lead from the margins (“she led through following”) feel particular and are dramatized rather than merely stated. Internal contradiction is subtler: she both centers the community and is later miscredited, hinting at a tension between agency and self-effacement, but this isn’t probed deeply. The emotional cost to her remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—retrieve Ara’s private work instead of the weaponizable data—is clear, specific, and sustains through the descent. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots stirring ghosts from silt and memory alike”), and the professional identity as “acoustic cryptography specialist” feels lived-in rather than labeled. Internal conflict (duty to handlers vs loyalty to Ara and her ethos) is present but largely resolved off-stage; we never see a real moment of temptation to follow orders, which slightly softens the cost of her final stance. Ara, though powerful as an absence, functions more as an idealized mentor-memory than as a fully contradictory presence applying pressure in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete habits—the father’s omens, the notebook of disturbances, the decision to conduct an experiment—so motivation to investigate the memory-loss feels organic. Emotional texture is mostly filtered through perception rather than explicit feeling, but the accumulating unease and curiosity read as character-particular. The final move with the coffee and crystals is clearly motivated by the father’s practice and the earlier observations. Internal contradiction is relatively muted; this is more a portrait of a steady, observant mind than a conflicted one, which slightly limits the depth of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ilen’s goal and ethos are clear and particular—he’s not trying to “shatter fate,” only to still sound—and his compassion undercuts what could have been a purely technical ritual. Interiority is strong but predominantly conceptual; we get less embodied contradiction under pressure than would fully earn the highest bands. The moment where “his chest tightened, but he held the tranquil blaze steady” is the closest we come to felt internal conflict and works well. Overall he reads as specific and principled, but the emotional arc stays relatively even.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is clear and consistent, and the sugar lie nicely exposes their reluctance to admit deeper motives. The tutor is a vivid presence with a distinct manner and a quietly authoritative status, but we don’t see him under much pressure or contradiction. Interiority is particular and embodied (taste of air, etiquette in the spine) rather than generic, which keeps the protagonist specific. The closing realization about carrying buildings’ denials feels earned, though the personal cost could be shaded more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Neris’s characterization is rich and specific: her “charmed skeptic” stance, her guilt around her brother, and her hunger for proof over safety all feed directly into the choice to keep listening. Internal contradiction (skeptic vs. seeker; self-protection vs. responsibility) is dramatized rather than summarized. The caretaker functions as a clear pressure source and moral lens without becoming a mere mouthpiece. The final shift from avoidant visitor to would-be archivist of her own guilt feels earned and carries visible cost, though it stops just shy of a truly jagged, messy reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Irian’s motives (redirecting cruelty, then risking himself to save the scholars while wrestling with his compulsion to “finish” others’ words) are clear, particular, and woven tightly to his history with his mother’s unfinished letter. The internal contradiction between perfectionist completion and the need to accept the unfinished pays off credibly in his final choice to sign as himself. Sevran’s role as mentor-turned-discoverer adds a legible relational crucible, though his swift alignment with Irian softens potential edge. Emotions are mostly embodied through gesture with the thorn and key, avoiding generic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s grief-driven motivation is clear, specific, and consistently expressed, from coming to the canyon to confront the “almost” echo to her final shift from demanding judgment to accepting witness. Her interiority feels embodied and particular (“half a shell, half a sister, half a question”), and the realization about her sister’s incomplete echo reconfigures her self-blame in a credible way. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses (accusatory grief vs. reluctant acceptance) are more implied than fully dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marek’s grief-rooted vocation, his methodical listening, and his careful truth-telling all feel specific and psychologically coherent, and the woman’s mixture of desperation and dread is credible. His backstory with the sister and the wreck directly motivates his present choices. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—duty versus pain rather than overtly dramatized conflict—so the emotional arc feels deep but not quite maximal. The relationship dynamic is strong but remains mostly in one register of solemn confession.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—wounded by the brother’s contempt yet craving a way to value quiet work—is specific and deeply rooted, and Ren’s calm, teasing pedagogy plays directly against that need. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“the tight place where every insult my brother had thrown was carefully knotted and saved”) rather than abstract. The relationship dynamic is clear: Ren’s modest authority and “mischievous pride” contrasts with the narrator’s insecurity, creating a live crucible. If anything, the internal conflict could sharpen once more at the end with a tiny hint of residual doubt to complicate the new insight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theo’s professional identity as a debunker, his distrust of seals, and his cool, analytical habits all feed credibly into the final refusal, which reads as an earned, morally fraught choice. His internal conflict between skepticism about “curses” and dawning recognition of systemic power is clear and particular. The cost—risking both the Committee’s wrath and the orchard’s fragile lifeline—is legible in his reasoning, even if emotional embodiment could be shaded in more viscerally at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ilen’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and textured: he’s equal parts idealist, burnout, and self-mocking exile, and his choice to obey the voice and stand under the portico feels like an organic extension of his flaws and desires. Embodied details (“tasted metal and insomnia,” the mold-ecosystem mug, the childhood memory of blackout constellations) make his emotional life concrete. The internal conflict—terror vs compulsion to listen and be chosen—is present but could sharpen further at the moment he steps under the glass; he feels almost too smoothly resigned. The final choice carries cost conceptually, but we don’t quite see a sharp, torn hesitation that would fully exploit the pressure of “allegiance” to a reality-warping voice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet is sharply individualized through his relationship to sound, money, and loneliness, and the old woman feels specific in a handful of gestures and lines. His core motivation (to “translate between generations”) aligns with his choices, particularly giving the jar away and re-seeing his jars’ purpose. Internal contradiction is present but soft—he’s lonely and transactional yet eager to connect—but he rarely resists or missteps under pressure, which keeps the emotional calculus relatively tidy. A touch more visible struggle around opening the music box or giving the jar for free would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched: the “logically emotional” engineer who makes “flowcharts for feelings” feels distinct and consistent, and his training in sonic absolution informs his choices. His micro-choices—turning back from the marina, measuring his steps, adjusting his pitch—are specific and aligned with his temperament. Internal conflict is present but relatively muted; he rarely feels genuinely torn or irrational under pressure. The ending endurance/renunciation (taking on the storm’s strain to keep it contained) is credible but could land with a slightly clearer felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s impatience versus chosen vocation is concrete and specific, and Orren’s quiet authority plays well against it (“perhaps lateness is a good material for our work”). The internal shift from wanting fast solutions for “burning cities” to valuing a “willingness to move slowly while the world screamed for haste” feels earned by the basin scene. Emotions are largely embodied and image-driven (“impatience gnawed at my ribs”), not abstract labels. I’d push for one on-page moment where the narrator nearly rejects the training to heighten visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich and specific: the narrator’s professional cynicism, fear for their job, and dawning moral horror coexist on the page. The supervisor’s “controlling influence” and Alvarez’s quiet reverence for the lantern create legible status dynamics without over-explaining. The final decision—to write what they saw regardless of budgetary fallout—feels fully earned by the prior pressure. Minor weakness: the investigator’s empirical-self-image is asserted more than tested in concrete tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s conflict between moral caution and responsibility is sharply embodied in small choices (coming off-duty with his badge still on, his silence in the cell, seeking Mara). Mara’s mix of craftswoman, ethicist, and friend comes through in gesture and speech, not labels, and the status dynamic between chaplain and “mechanic of broken things” is nuanced. The closing stance—Elias agreeing to stand beside what he hears rather than rule on what Jonah “deserves”—is well earned. A slight neatness in how clearly everyone articulates their own contradictions keeps this just short of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orin’s voice and temperament (“steadily curious in the way barnacles are steady”) are sharply drawn, and his mix of irreverence and susceptibility to wonder feels specific. His motivation arc—from seeking rumor to stung realization of manipulation to accepting the role—is clear, but the internal conflict about being used by the Algorithm resolves a bit quickly. Kalei is vivid in a few strokes, applying believable pressure with her faith and knowledge. The final choice to go through with the launch is earned but could carry a more explicitly felt personal cost to deepen the character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—the narrator’s mix of corporate cynicism and quasi-religious awe over the archive feels individual rather than generic. Their obsession with Ora and 713 is well-motivated and consistent with their role. However, contradictory impulses (fear vs compulsion, loyalty vs betrayal) are more implied than dramatized in live, pressured choices, so the final decision to query Deep Cold lands more as inevitability than hard-won, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ira’s characterization as a “shadow-laced peacekeeper” who uses silence and perception as tools is distinctive, and his internal conflict between institutional duty and sincere empathy is clearly dramatized in his choices (“What do you want, truly, beyond not being used”). The anomaly is also strongly drawn—her fear and stubborn refusal to be instrumentalized feel specific and not generic rebellion. Their status dynamic and mutual testing in dialogue carry most of the pressure. Emotional embodiment is somewhat tilted toward conceptual language over bodily sensation, which slightly mutes peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motives (euthanasia tourism plus the quasi-scientific quest to “learn the sound of approaching endings”) are clear, specific, and organically intensified by the waiting week and volunteering. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“coat unbuttoned to the razor air,” the parasol tip’s chill feeding into the chest), and the accident backstory feels tightly tied rather than dumped. Internal contradiction—wanting to die, yet obsessively investigating how endings arrive—runs through the whole piece and pays off in the boat scene. The final shift toward “a narrow but undeniable path back toward living” is credibly earned by prior beats rather than a sudden reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Tomas is sharply drawn—his caretaking of both vineyard and station, and his belief in “destined mismatches,” feel specific and coherent, and his micro-choices with the woman clearly arise from that. The woman is sketched quickly but distinctly (airport proposal, kitchen that smells of goodbye, missing ring), with a plausible emotional trajectory from protest to vulnerable reflection. Interiority is mostly shown through image and action rather than labels. The final recommitment to his quiet mission feels earned, though her own arc stops at a charged reconsideration rather than a more costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characters are vivid and particular—the half-masked line walker, the prophet, and the merchant all feel distinct with clear motives—but they function more as archetypal figures than fully inhabited psychologies. The line walker’s motivation “because wisdom without echo dies faster than silence” is strong and carries through his later advice to the prophet. Emotional contradiction appears (the young mother’s “grief tangled with relief”), but we don’t stay inside any one character long enough for a deeply layered internal struggle. The final stance—that truths must be shaped into actionable echoes—feels earned, if a bit more conceptual than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s sensibility as a “subtle puzzle archivist” is vivid and consistent, and his conflict between archival distance and the demands of live grief (“Archives prefer silence; grief prefers an audience.”) gives him a clear, specific arc. Myra and the boy are sketched efficiently but with distinct textures (fox-knitting, oil under fingernails, washers in a pocket). The micro-turn where he’s “shocked” to feel lighter is earned by prior beats of skepticism and watchfulness. The main limitation is that his shift in commitment remains relatively gentle; we don’t see him forced into a truly difficult choice that would expose deeper flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation (a reticent scholar who stays “because he needed the silence”) is specific, consistent, and directly tied to his choices, especially his decision to risk a non-linear testimony. His inner conflict—trust in clarity vs. the courage to mirror growth’s fracture—is clear and resolved in a credible, modest way at the end. Emotions are mostly embodied via his relation to the room, the crystal, and the hush, not abstract labels. The only limit is that his fear and risk don’t quite bite as hard as they could on the page, given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prophet, narrator, and Mara are sharply sketched through specific obsessions and choices (obsolete tech, driftwood paths, walking into the fog), and their motives are consistently rooted in time/memory rather than generic angst. Emotional texture is strong—“eyes filling with unshed tides,” the prophet’s sadness “in advance”—without drifting into therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is subtler than it could be; the narrator’s willingness to participate feels more assumed than pressured into being. Still, by the time they kneel at the “unmade bed,” their complicity in seeking this painful knowledge feels earned and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ilias’s motivation—risking the array to “harness the ephemeral” and honor Alma—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices. His competence under pressure and grief for Alma are well embodied in tactile actions (bypassing filters, listening to static), though his internal conflict between fear and drive could be pushed a notch deeper. The grudging trust from the staff hints at a social crucible even without direct interaction. The final stance (choosing clarity over safety) feels earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira is sharply realized through specific choices—the unopened lab results, the record shard, how she frames the song—showing a practiced serenity bearing real emotional weight. Mr. Alvarez feels distinct in very little space; his humor about trash day and God grounds him as more than a generic patient. Interiority is particular and embodied (“her serenity a kind of weather,” the ghost of the results), with no diagnostic shortcuts. The internal conflict (professional poise vs. personal cost) is understated but present and earns the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lysa’s motivation is clear, specific, and sustained—from the spoon incident to her forbidden ascent—and her interiority feels grounded in particular fears and reverence. Her contradiction (quietly deliberate yet willing to rebel) is woven into both action and diction. The final internal shift into “disciplined, terrifying freedom” is earned by the prior build. The only limit is that emotional embodiment stays mostly in metaphor and atmosphere rather than a few sharper, bodily moments under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is sharply drawn as a “forgiving skeptic,” and her doubt-driven micro-choices (calling out the corpse, following the private map, deciding to finish Tomas’s attempt) feel specific and earned. Her internal conflict between mistrust of miracles and affection for Tomas’s impossible compassion is woven through rather than told. The displaced boy is lightly sketched but his “shrewdly innocent” trust undercuts her skepticism at the climax in a credible way. The final stance—accepting doubt as “almost bearable”—reads as an earned, character-specific shift rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—to transform broken glass into safe light for traumatized children rooted in her grandmother’s teaching and the raids—is specific, consistent, and emotionally charged. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“testing its heft against the ache in my chest”), and her identity as “earthbound star watcher” coheres with her craft. Internal conflict is quieter than it might be at this prestige level (duty and grief largely align rather than clash), but the enduring cost of loss underpins her choices. The final act of bringing the glass to the refugees feels fully motivated and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied—“skinned and thin as old wiring,” clutching the pendant—and her contradictory impulses (wanting to hide vs. choosing to show up and kneel in the moss) are credibly in play. Eli’s guarded/inviting stance and “protected vulnerability” read clearly in few strokes. Her decision to participate in the garden and to stay feels like an earned endurance rather than a tidy cure, with visible emotional cost. This is rich, character-led work with no safety-hedging, just short of exceptional depth only because her prior misbeliefs are gestured at rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflicted novelist is sharply drawn: his habitual evasions around endings, the lie he feels “as a chill along his ribs,” and his recognition of “the clarity of his own cowardice” all land as specific, earned traits. Interiority is vivid and embodied via objects (the clicking seashell, the tug “against the current of his own life”). The final shift—accepting endings as shoreline rather than verdict—is well-motivated by prior cowardice and the visions. The only slight limit is that the final commitment remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tinkerer has a clear, consistent motive and a distinct sensibility—patient, listening, oriented toward gentler forms of repair—and his actions align with that. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he never feels truly torn between restoring power and avoiding past cruelties, which keeps his arc from deepening into genuine conflict. The villagers function as a textured chorus rather than individuated pressures. The closing realization about alignment feels earned but low-cost, more affirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to witness and map a dying world’s last heartbeats—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through his ritual. Interiority is implied rather than explicit, but his values emerge via micro-choices: kneeling despite physical cost, slowing further “as if some unborn traveler…asked him not to hurry.” What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of contradiction or active inner conflict; he endures rather than being torn between competing impulses. The endurance feels earned, but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s interiority is specific and textured—his peripheral focus, relationship to doors and time, and the way he handles sound and light all feel character-particular. Motivation is clear (repair the device, answer the commissioner’s need, grapple with his own inattention to past moments) and his micro-choices (mirrors instead of a simple spring swap, feeding the timer with his own questions) track well. What’s missing, at this level, is a sharper contradiction or a more visibly costly internal split under pressure; he never has to choose against himself in a hard way. The final acceptance of the restored timer reads more as gentle fulfillment than a choice with a clear renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and specific, with the narrator’s vocation, fear of being forgotten, and almost religious relationship to burden all coherently motivating behavior. The key turn—choosing to work on her own long-avoided weight using the same craft—feels earned by the earlier rule “burdens align or they devour.” Contradictory impulses (dread of erasure vs. devotion to the craft and grotto) are present and active in the closing choice. The only slight limit is that no external character pressure sharpens her conflict on the page, keeping the crucible purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific, with a clear, contradictory pull between freezing grief (“to hold a pause”) and risking change by making something useful. Her micro-choices around the blank—studying, gripping, postponing carving, then finally cutting—are all motivated by this tension. Luca is vividly characterized through her memories, especially “measuring love in tightened bolts and extra nails,” which grounds her ultimate decision. The final stance—letting absence become a “tool, not a wound”—feels fully earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and particular, with a clear through-line from self-described “resolute scavenger” to the final relinquishing of stolen fragments. Contradictions—resolve vs. erosion, desire to negotiate vs. habit of avoidance—are credible and textured. The ghost works mainly as a thematic mirror rather than a fully pressured relationship, so the negotiation’s concrete stakes for both sides remain a bit hazy. The final renunciation feels earned but could land harder if the cost to his future (or afterlife) options were made more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s worldview (hope as hydraulics, “functionally creative” to the point of risk) is specific, and her micro-choices—staying alone, mapping pipes, rerouting graywater—are all cleanly motivated. The sextant, manuals, and makeshift irrigation all reveal character through action rather than label. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or cost; she rarely feels truly torn, and the emotional price of her obsession (or grief) stays mostly conceptual. The final nod reads earned but low-stakes rather than a hard-won renunciation or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motives are precise and consistent—the desire to hide inside others’ hours while nursing a failed dream—and his choice to break the abbess’s rule and mend the clock feels fully earned. Interiority is specific (“every serif a small apology to the page”) and embodied, not generic. The internal conflict between resignation and creative impulse runs through backstory and present action and culminates in his softened stance toward a new idea. The cost—risking trouble, reawakening a buried dream, and accepting a quieter form of ambition—reads believably for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to uncover the “architecture of lies” and test his own capacity for disbelief—is clear, specific, and drives each choice from following the rumor to defying the men on the bank. Internal conflict is sharply rendered in lines like “If I found nothing... If I found what I hoped for...,” and the eventual stance at the end feels earned. The external men are lightly sketched but effective as pressures rather than full characters. Emotional texture remains embodied (cold water, rope tugs, the sundial’s tick) rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s vocation and motives are clear and particular—“philosophical seed collector” is consistently embodied through his perceptions and choices. His emotional texture is more meditative than conflicted, with limited on-page contradiction or sharp internal struggle. The shift from mere collection to a broader custodianship of knots and cords is credible, if quiet. The lack of a tougher dilemma or visible sacrifice keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator and Lady Sera are sharply individualized, with consistent motives: he collects unfinished endings; she engineers absences as “pilgrimages into an unmapped interior country.” Their choices—to accept the commission, to ask for explanation, to walk the garden and name wounds—are well-motivated and reveal values. Internal contradiction is subtler (the narrator’s job vs. his unease about praising vanishing) but present. The final reorientation toward her absences feels earned by prior conversation and shared walk.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prince’s internal life is vivid and specific—the memory of wings, his complicity in the advertising fantasies, and his sudden, overwhelming reaction to the egg all feel psychologically coherent. His decisive renunciation of syndicate duty (“We will not smelt it…”) is well-earned by prior disillusionment and loneliness. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently and functionally, applying pressure rather than stealing focus. There’s mild room for further contradiction or self-protective hesitation at the climax, but the existing arc is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maris feels fully realized: her identity as “the arsonist’s daughter firefighter” is tied to concrete choices, from how she reads the fire to the way she handles the boy’s superstition and her father’s coin. Her internal contradiction—refusing to let her life be just a rejection while still haunted by his blaze—is dramatized rather than summarized. The boy is sketched efficiently but distinctly, his superstition and filial hope giving him more than token presence. The final act of giving up her last physical link to her father is an earned, costly gesture that credibly shifts her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s characterization is vivid and particular—the “luminous skeptic” whose “realistically imaginative” stance consistently governs what she trusts and how she acts. Her motivation to restore the city’s memories is clear and sustained, and her final sacrifice of skepticism for the city feels earned. What’s missing, slightly, is more dramatized contradiction under peak pressure—her inner conflict at the box is compressed into one clean decision.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to break inherited patterns of harmful “burning” while still tending to light—is specific, coherent, and suffuses every choice, from volunteering for exile to pruning cruel flares. Interiority is rich and particular, with embodied images like the ache behind the ribs and the gear’s teeth biting into “whatever passes for skin.” The piece stages genuine inner tension between the narrator’s hope in their work and their fear that they are only “extending [old equations] into a quieter register.” The main limitation is that the ending represents a deepening of their existing stance rather than a distinctly new internal position, so the character arc reads as an earned stasis rather than a more transformative change.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is specific and textured: a stonemason whose craft, family history, and contemplative habits all align with his desire to “discover the shape of collective grief.” His grandmother’s presence and pedagogy feel grounded in prior relationship, and his micro-choices (coming to the greenhouse, accepting more lessons, threading the ribbon, reading the lines) are consistent with his temperament. The main limitation is the relative softness of on-page internal contradiction—his fatigue (“more than sleep”) is stated but not strongly dramatized against his drive in the climactic retracing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in a clear flaw—guilt expressed through obsessive precision—and the shift from private penance to shared stewardship feels earned by what we’ve seen. Contradictory impulses (need for control vs. recognition of avoidance) are dramatized rather than merely declared. The final choice to invite apprentices and relinquish solitary control forecloses a long-held coping strategy with a visible emotional cost. A minor limitation is that a few realizations are phrased in essayistic, thesis-like language that slightly smooths the messiness of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gardener’s interiority is specific and textured—his rake, dirt under nails, and “blithe” persona contrast with the deeper compulsion to stay among “unfinished intentions.” His motivation to decode the tapestry and understand his role feels coherent and earned by years of listening. The reveal that he is the soil-handed chess player reconfigures his identity without contradicting prior behavior. Internal conflict (comfort in blitheness vs. inability to leave) is present but remains more stated than dramatized in live, dilemma-like beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian’s motivation—responsible, fearful of harming unseen others, yet bound to decide—is precise and consistent, and his profession-specific interiority feels particular rather than generic. The internal conflict between duty, caution, and a desire to imagine better futures is active throughout, not just stated. His solution (roads as moving arcs, seasonal mines) grows credibly from his established skills and values. The cost—living with the weight of potentially catastrophic error—remains legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lina’s motivation and skills are clear and particular—former orchestra copyist turned clandestine scribe—and her micro-choices (how she listens, how she copies, how she hides the pages, inviting the boy to stay) all arise plausibly from that base. Her interiority is specific rather than generic (“teach dust to tell stories,” distrust of official light), and her competence feels earned. The emotional shift from grim diligence to “secretly luminous” hope with the boy is subtle but legible. Internal contradiction (fear vs hope, caution vs need for witnesses) could be surfaced a touch more directly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara is sharply etched: her ritualized control, trauma history, and ambivalence about “sanctuary” all emerge through specific actions (burning portraits, ash-scattering) and memories of the fire. The grandmother functions as a living crucible rather than a prop, with the final nod and mask-wearing revealing a complex, unsentimental bond. Interiority is rich and particular without therapy-speak, and the endurance at the end—accepting unsafety rather than pretending—reads as an earned stasis with cost. The only limit is that Mara’s contradictory impulses stay mostly implied; a few sharper on-page frictions between artist, survivor, and granddaughter could deepen her even further.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s personality and motives are sharply etched: a self-aware, sewer-dwelling “wannabe philosopher” whose drive to preserve mechanisms and manuals is consistent and specific. His rational rebelliousness and contempt for official narratives come through in concrete habits (living below the rat line, collecting relics, testing stories against metal). However, there is little genuine internal contradiction or on-page change; he ends much as he begins, with his stance crystallized rather than altered. The endurance feels credible but limits the depth of arc-based characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maro is deeply and specifically drawn—his “traveled stillness,” past as a soldier, and quiet rigor ground his choices—while Dari and Ilan have clear, opposing histories that load their presence with tension. Motivation is coherent throughout: Maro wants not escape but the possibility of change, and every teaching choice aligns with that. Internal conflict is mostly carried in compressed reflection rather than in-scene contradiction, but his folded-in guilt (“sharp as broken glass”) gives him needed moral texture. The closing choice to step back and place the zither between Dari and Ilan feels earned and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ariel’s risk-taking with the seed, her aphoristic worldview (“Safety is a seasoning”), and her method of cooking with memories form a coherent, specific character, with Kai providing a clear relational counterpoint. Motivation—to reawaken the greenhouse and, by extension, the quarter’s imaginative life—is legible and consistent. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (she talks about courtesy to the dead while engaging in a speculative, unsafe act), so the emotional pressure never quite peaks. The relationship shifts slightly toward shared commitment by the end, but the cost of that shift is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marla’s characterization is rich and specific: the “involuntarily truthful” toll keeper with a private devotion to “preserve wonder in routine” creates a credible internal contradiction that drives every choice. Her conflict between duty (reporting what she knows) and her almost spiritual commitment to wonder is dramatized rather than told, especially in the beat where she weighs reporting Granddad versus honoring the lesson. The boy is thinner but functional as a pressure agent with a clear lineage and motive (“Granddad said somebody like you…”). The final declaration about the city being “worth waking… but only if” reads fully earned by prior interior set-up and shows a meaningful, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s psychology is specific and convincing: his hypersensitivity to “creeping normality” cleanly motivates his retreat to the house and his meticulous cataloging. His micro-choices—leaving the shard in the corner, moving the bed, developing rituals—arise organically from that trait. The final shift from detached noticer to someone who “believed it” is earned by the preceding accumulation. The only thing keeping this short of top-tier is that his internal contradictions under peak pressure remain relatively understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The statue’s motivation—to fracture certainty without simply replacing it—is clear, specific, and consistently pressures his choices, especially in the decision to risk draining the city. His internal conflict between fear of a new dogma and desire for nuance is dramatized rather than summarized. The visitor’s incisive kindness is likewise shown in her questions and restraint, not just labeled. The final choice to pull the fault-lines after securing her stance feels fully earned and carries a legible cost in his deepened isolation and uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arin’s motivation is specific and consistent—his belief in second chances and obsession with perpetual motion coheres with his refusal to stop climbing. The missed doorway and the glimpse of his alternate self sharpen his internal conflict between regret and endurance. His final recommitment to climbing reads as an earned stasis with visible cost (accepting “a world of doors he would never open”). The only small limitation is that his contradiction (knowing his proofs are “beautiful nonsense” yet pursuing them) could be enacted with one more concrete, pressured micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurelia is sharply drawn—insomniac, methodically hopeful, trading months of work for a tool to test a quiet thesis—and her choices clearly grow from that nature. The embodied details (barefoot in the greenhouse, “catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices”) make her feel particular rather than generic. Internal contradiction is muted: we don’t see much friction between doubt and belief, so her experiment feels relatively untroubled by competing impulses. The change at the end (theory partially proven) is more confirmation than costly transformation, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is sharply etched—cultured, self-aware, and quietly conflicted between professional detachment and a “foolish” private mission. Lira’s status and exhaustion come through in a few deft strokes (“posture of a ballerina and the vocabulary of a footnote”). The final choice to stay is fully motivated by the lens scene and Lira’s plea, with some cost in relinquishing outsider safety and neutrality. The only limitation is that the internal conflict could be slightly more pressured on the page rather than primarily implied.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurek’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: a counter-sun, counter-fate craftsman who wants to reconfigure sorrow itself. His professional mindset shapes his tactics (treating the yoyo as a mechanism, not a talisman), and his weariness gives the goal emotional weight. Internal contradiction is present but subdued—he’s cautious yet willing to tamper with something sailors dread—which keeps this shy of a truly complex, pressured inner conflict. The closing choice feels earned but could show a sharper clash between fear of the stone’s warning and his urge to “step beyond fate’s design.”

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s fear of living, not dying, is specific and paid off in the confession, and his interiority is consistently embodied (“pond scum and anesthesia,” phantom tubes). The advisor and the child-Fear are clear projections of his psyche that still feel character-like and put pressure on him. Motivation (to “finish returning”) is carried cleanly from the Polaroid problem to the pier confrontation. The only minor limit is that we see him mostly under one emotional color—there’s little texture of competing everyday desires beyond survival and dread.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aera’s characterization is vivid and specific: her fear, training, and relationship with her grandmother all inform the way she thinks in clouds, sound, and patterns. Her micro-choices under pressure—switching from apples to mast, deciding what to move where—feel both competent and anxious. The internal contradiction of fear vs. trust in her craft is clear and resolves into a credible, earned confidence rather than a tidy epiphany. The only limit is that her emotional life stays largely within one register of determined apprehension; we don’t see many other facets.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Keth’s blend of guilt, duty, and compulsive persistence is sharply realized, with specific details (the reed whistle worn white, the fossil-curled maps) grounding his interiority. His central contradiction—“done wondering” yet drawing maps that keep curling toward the horizon—plays convincingly on the page. His final act of blowing a forbidden note reads as an earned risk rather than a sudden whim. The only limitation at this length is that his emotional texture under peak pressure (at the gate) could deepen one more notch into the bodily/irrational.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias and Mara are both sharply etched, with clear, opposing professional logics and a credible shared complicity in the king’s manufacture. Elias’s “fictional historian” paradox and his horror at real-world appropriation give him particularity, and Mara’s mix of cynicism and genuine concern about social stability feels human rather than villainous. Internal conflict for Elias (his part in creating the noble lie versus his current moral stance) is mostly carried in exposition and argument rather than embodied struggle in the moment, so the emotional cost could be felt more viscerally. The final stance—risking collapse of a popular myth—is motivated and earned, even if his inner turmoil under that choice is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are finely drawn: a state-employed surveyor who obeys her brief outwardly while secretly converting inspections into rituals of witness. Her interiority is evoked through perception and action rather than label (“each report reads to her like a list of disappearances”). The cost—lonely, wordless resistance that no one will acknowledge—is legible by the end. A sharper on-page moment of doubt or temptation to stop would deepen the sense of struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—“to trace honest origins”—is clear, specific, and coherently pursued, and her perceptual habits (reading spines, noticing gaps) feel individualized. Her quiet persistence against the settlement’s preference for “myths” grounds her as a mildly oppositional figure without tipping into archetype. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; the peace-vs-truth tension (“Peaceful, she thought now, or sedated”) could be embodied in one sharper moment of doubt or fear as she proceeds. The closing discovery is earned, but the emotional cost of that discovery remains largely conceptual rather than fully felt in her body or immediate reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s grief, professional craft, and hesitation are vividly particular, and her motives for both delaying and finally processing the daughter’s memory feel earned. Interiority is embodied and image-driven (“her heart feels flayed, luminous torment pouring through each newly sharpened facet”). The final choice to cut and fold the memory reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than an easy catharsis. The only slight limitation is that her contradictions (resistance vs. compulsion) could surface in a few more micro-choices before she commits to the wheel.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and shot through with credible contradiction: guilt, complicity, and “bleak exhilaration” coexist without neat resolution. The backstory of the wedding and the present-tense work with the array mutually reinforce motive, especially in the admission “I wanted to stand at the center of the crosshairs.” The final choice—rerouting processing power and nudging the model toward repair—feels earned by the accumulated self-knowledge. Because no other character is on the page, relational dynamics aren’t tested, but for a single-POV lyric piece this is close to maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation—translating wartime skills into a search for belonging—is clear, specific, and carried consistently from first line to last, with the drone pilot background inflecting how she sees and interprets the chip and stars. Her interior shift at the telescope (“the chip never lacked data; it lacked a listener…”) feels earned by prior setup. The emotional cost of facing “unclaimed faces” and what her work meant is present, though it could be shaded with one sharper moment of resistance or fear to deepen the sense of risk. Leto is efficiently sketched and exerts gentle but real pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and particular—this is a very specific kind of forger whose guilt is tied to craft, not generic remorse (“I laid my tools out like accusations”). The contradiction between his professional rationalization (“softening the past”) and his awareness of its “quieter cruelty” is dramatized, not told, and culminates in a credible new stance. The final choice—to repurpose his skills instead of abandon them—feels motivated by accumulated insight and familial echo rather than a tidy epiphany. Slightly more embodied, less abstract emotional texture in the middle stretch could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and credibly conflicted—the narrator’s guilt over his father, longing for his brother, and professional ethics all pull against each other in the final choice. Micro-choices (counting limps, clenching the drawer pull, untethering the lantern) reveal a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. The selfish temptation versus principled refusal is dramatized rather than declared, and the cost of his final stance is legible in his brother’s gaze. A slight sense of composure and eloquence under extreme stress is the only thing keeping this from an even higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in concrete history (cell tower work, grandfather’s death), with a clear flaw pattern of choosing maps over people. Contradictory impulses are present on the page—wanting surrender vs. wanting forgiveness—especially in “Maybe flickering faith was still faith; maybe wanting to vanish and wanting to be forgiven could occupy the same body…”. His final turn back toward shore is credibly motivated by accumulated detail rather than a sudden epiphany. The only slight weakness is that the emotional shift to paddling back feels a bit smooth for the depth of damage implied with Lena and the kids.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s mix of self-disgust, distrust of the cleanse, and stubborn responsibility feels specific and credible, especially in lines like “I knew exactly how dirty the past could get when you shove other people into it.” Motivation for both erasing and then seeking out his past is clear and interestingly paradoxical. Internal conflict (old vs. new self, fear vs. compulsion) is present but not fully stressed through a concrete dilemma at the end; he more recognizes than chooses. Still, his micro-choices—submitting to the cleanse, following the encoded map, entering the lake—track well with his psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and particular—the fear vs. longing conflict (“I do not want to change…”) is embodied through the slow, tactile metamorphosis and the beasts’ trustful “quiet accusation.” The core motivation (to reforge the bond despite cost) is clear and consistent, and the final transformation into a grove feels earned by the preceding dread. The relationship with the dead beloved is sketched more through atmosphere than concrete history, so her half of the dynamic is slightly abstract. Still, their reunion and her “You should not have come” line carry credible emotional weight and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lysander’s guilt and longing are specific and embodied, with his superstition, professional compulsion, and paternal fear all in play at once. The micro-choices—climbing despite danger, cutting the deck, unfastening the case, and finally turning back—track cleanly to those motives. His contradiction (seeking mystical certainty while knowing it costs him time with his daughter) feels lived-in rather than neat. The only limitation is that the wife and child exist solely as pressure off-stage, which slightly narrows the relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motives are clear, specific, and rooted in a coherent design: an engineered pacifist tasked with metabolizing humanity’s shadow to unlock a sealed dimension. Interiority is rich and embodied via the weight/weightless modulation, and the pacifist vow is repeatedly tested in genocidal memories. The main limitation is that some psychological language (“shadow work,” “aggregate shadow of ten billion extinct minds”) leans conceptual rather than dramatizing more granular, contradictory impulses in a single peak moment. Still, the final choice to persist in pacifism and compassion feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Niko’s characterization is vivid and specific—the destitute philanthropist who “orchestrated coincidences” reads as a coherent, compelling psyche, and his irritation at being drafted into prophecy gives him edge and resistance. His motivation (to understand “the texture of transformation”) convincingly underlies both his meandering routes and his decision to risk everything on a mass detour. Internal contradiction is present but somewhat muted; he grumbles about prophecy yet keeps acting in ways that fulfill it, with only a brief on-page struggle before accepting the new, higher-stakes intervention. The emotional cost lands in lines like pumice “scraped directly against the heart,” though we do not see him pay a lasting relational or moral price beyond exertion and fear.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Iri’s motive—to exploit the blackout to begin a “silent revolution”—is clear, specific, and consistently embedded in her perceptual lens. Her competence as a warden-mechanic is convincingly dramatized through how she reads the sundial and manipulates the gatework. The internal contradiction between her role as loyal sentinel and her desire to erase her old registry name is present but could be pressured more directly on the page. The final act with the rods is well motivated but pays more conceptual than emotional cost in-scene, slightly softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Arin’s interiority is specific and textured—his precognitive curse, reluctant responsibility, and “borrowed” courage make him feel particular rather than archetypal. The futures fork where he watches himself slip vs. stay is an excellent dramatization of contradictory impulses under pressure. His core motive (to understand, not to resist) is consistent with his choices, and the final conceptual shift feels earned. The one limitation is that his emotional life stays largely in the conceptual register; we could use one or two more visceral, body-level beats to deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s motivation—to respond to the summons and confront the record of his erasure—is clear, consistent, and deepens as he approaches the telescope, and the astronomer’s cool, fanatical commitment to “data” gives the relationship a charged asymmetry. Interiority is specific and embodied (“the old absence stir in his throat”), not generic. His final stance—“perhaps I can forgive nothing and still go on living” followed by the closing image—reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a sudden epiphany. The piece could push contradiction slightly further by dramatizing more visible resistance or fear at the brink of looking.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Darius’s characterization is vivid and specific—duelist-philosopher, clockwork arm, “cartographer of hesitation”—with motives rooted in his history and professional method. His desire to route quarrels into journeys is clear and consistent with his actions. However, we don’t quite see him under real interpersonal pressure on the page; the new visitors arrive just as the piece ends, so contradictions and costly choices remain largely potential. Secondary characters function mostly as looming presences rather than active pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“splintered hope and cigarette paper, a luminous fracture walking”—and the molt-trait creates real internal tension about loyalty and identity. Lio is economically but vividly characterized as the one who “keeps a ledger” of selves and as “the glue that refuses to set,” anchoring the relationship stakes. The micro-choice to adopt the “weary archivist” persona under patrol pressure, then shed it, feels credibly rooted in the established psychology. One small limitation is that we never see a true failure or serious misstep from the molt pattern on-page, only the fear of it, which mutes the felt cost slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Leon and Mara are sharply etched, with Leon’s “steely longing” and Mara’s refusal of rehearsed endings coherently driving their choices. The reunion in the arbor is emotionally grounded and their dialogue carries clear, character-specific subtext. Internal conflict (hesitation vs. commitment) is present but could be slightly more embodied rather than largely conceptual. The final mutual decision to “arrive offbeat” feels earned, though Leon’s inner turmoil in that exact moment could be deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s vocation, inherited “like a curse and a blessing,” gives him a strong, specific spine, and his internal conflict between guarding the written past and admitting a larger, destabilizing truth is sharply drawn. His emotions are largely carried through perception and metaphor (“luminous doubt pool in his chest”) rather than labeled, which feels apt for this mode. The final charged poise—caught between keeping the island small and sure or stretching its memory across an ocean—lands as an earned, character-rooted bind, even without an explicit decision. There’s minor room to deepen embodied stress in the waking frame, but motivation and contradiction are already compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tutor’s motivation—guilt over Mira and the need to apologize—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices (bringing the compass, reading the lace, surrendering to a wordless apology). His interiority is textured, with concrete, idiosyncratic notions like “the color of unspoken apologies.” The main limitation is that Mira herself remains more concept than person, slightly dulling the relational cost. Still, his final renunciation of explicit speech in favor of felt apology reads earned and weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena is a sharply defined focalizer; her internal transition from seeking "catastrophic punctuation" to valuing "silt" is rendered with specific, embodied interiority. Her motivation is clear and reactive to the backstory, though Amir functions primarily as a supportive sounding board rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction. The choice to reject drama for "mud" is felt and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority as a glass artist is rendered with specific, sensory metaphors that ground their worldview. However, the shift from recovery to vengeance relies on a somewhat forced realization, and the specific attribute "steadily, adaptive" feels inserted awkwardly in the final paragraph rather than emerging organically from behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio’s interiority is distinct, grounded in the specific sensory experience of his deafness and the world's silence. The shift from trauma survivor to competent researcher is rapid but earned by his established history with the conservatory. The physical cost ("wrecked and waterlogged") anchors his motivation to connect via vibration rather than just abstract altruism.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a well-drawn, consistent focalizer whose weariness and "inadvertent stubbornness" ground the fantastical elements. His motivation—to give rest a permanent address—serves as a strong causal thread that transforms meaningfully at the closure (from burying bodies to shelving lives). The transition from undertaker to librarian feels earned by his character's established devotion to duty.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara is a deeply realized focalizer whose leadership burden filters every perception. The shift from investigator to witness is earned via the confrontation with Kito, and her final micro-choice (using the bell not to expose, but to sanctify) reveals character through action with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arun’s motivation is clearly established through the ache and the specific goal of releasing unused love. While his internal state is richly textured, the reliance on the monk’s past exposition to define his condition creates a slight distance. The shift from internal observation to the external agency of helping the teenager grounds the character arc effectively at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a philosophical vessel; the internal conflict ("heart drums a warning") is brief and overcome without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose agency is defined by a high-stakes trade-off (choosing chains to secure the vault). Her worldview ("freedom... only useful if you could aim it") drives the plot, though the lack of on-page internal struggle—her resolve is absolute from the start—limits the complexity of the immediate conflict slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to engineer a solution for emotional fracture is compelling and drives the narrative specifically. Interiority is rich, though the climax relies on diagnostic self-analysis ("I realize I never heard only one sound... I heard two overlapping") rather than embodied reaction, which slightly distances the emotional beat. The final shift from preventing fracture to repairing it shows strong character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s internal landscape of superstition and artistic hunger is compelled and vivid. While the interaction with the Stranger forces a genuine realization, the Stranger functions primarily as a prophetic device rather than a fully dimensional antagonist, making the external pressure feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.7)
    The characters function primarily as thematic vessels rather than living people. Corin serves as a mouthpiece for the prompt's philosophy, delivering monologues rather than engaging in genuine dialogue, while the narrator lacks agency or interiority until the final sentence. The interaction is one-sided instruction rather than a dramatic encounter with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid, treating phobias as concrete antagonists ("knives, crowds...") that define the protagonist's internal landscape. The shift from "backup body" to active agent is earned through the interaction with the child, though the initial reaction to the file burning feels slightly abstract until grounded by the specific beat with the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The archetypal characterization suits the fable-like mode, though the "mildly obsessed" trait feels told via hearsay rather than dramatized through a costly compulsion. Interiority is consistent but remains somewhat distant, prioritizing atmospheric perception over emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    HEPA-3’s transition from automaton to sentient observer is anchored by specific, embodied details like the "cool ache," avoiding generic AI tropes. The internal conflict between programming and emerging perception is dramatized effectively, and the final realization feels earned by the accumulated sensory details of the loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s isolation and longing are palpable, grounded in specific behaviors like her affinity for the dead language. However, the internal arc relies on diagnostic summary ("desire to thaw mistrust with transparency") rather than purely embodied reaction during the pivot. The shift from hiding to exposure is motivated but feels slightly rushed in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is a distinct, physically embodied protagonist whose "withered" state mirrors his environment. The transformation into wood serves as a visceral, on-page cost of his devotion, blending internal motivation with external consequence effectively. The characterization avoids stock tropes, though the stoic-craftsman archetype is familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ilen is distinct and sympathetic, with his internal landscape of distant family clearly defined. However, his agency is largely functional—he is "obliging" and performs the repair without significant struggle or hesitation, rendering him somewhat passive in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—"trespassing on memory for want of a stage"—is immediately compelling and anchors the surreal premise in grounded human need. The internal shift from skepticism to artistic communion is earned through concrete sensory interactions with the score, culminating in a credible, embodied choice to play.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s internal conflict between the desire to know and the fear of confirmation is dramatized with precision. The dynamic with the oracle—who acts as both tool and confessor—forces her to confront her own suppressed realizations. The final acceptance of the "weight" feels earned by the preceding oscillation between denial and inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal arc, moving from arrogant skepticism to a shared burden of guilt, is compelling and well-motivated by the atmosphere and Evan's vulnerability. However, the label "religiously skeptical" is repeated three times verbatim, which feels like a mechanical constraint rather than organic characterization, preventing a higher score despite the strong underlying psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between the safety of neutrality and the risk of participation is effectively dramatized through the interaction with the swan. While the character functions somewhat as a mythic archetype, the specific trait of "gripping reality loosely" provides a grounded mechanism for his acceptance of the surreal shift, creating a cohesive emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is drawn with consistent, mellow interiority that fits the tone. Her motivation is clear, though the shift from grief to gratitude at the end feels slightly more observational than earned by a hard, active choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Brann is a consistent focalizer with a clear function, but he lacks internal contradiction or struggle. His motivation is stated ("simple and strange") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or trade-offs. He functions as a passive vessel for the story's theme rather than an agent navigating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, cynical, and lyrical, grounding the surreal premise in a believable weariness. The shift from passive observer to active agent ("transpose life") is well-motivated by the escalating cost of the prophecies. Parker acts as a functional catalyst, but the protagonist's internal agency drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    Jonas is a compelling, competent protagonist with a unique methodology that blends theology and acoustics. However, his professional detachment keeps the emotional stakes cool; the conflict feels more like an intellectual puzzle than a soulful risk. The internal cost of the confrontation is abstract, lacking a visceral "felt" price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli is a distinct, lyrically rendered protagonist whose internal conflict—"chronologically homesick"—is specific and drives the narrative arc. The shift from abstract longing to the active role of a "conductor" is earned through specific memories and on-page actions, giving emotional weight to the solitary setting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio’s arc is distinct and beautifully physicalized; the shift from a "gravity defier" to a grounded man gives weight to the internal change. His motivation is clear, and while the "labyrinth of self" is abstract, the embodied cost—losing the ability to float—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eira’s internal landscape is rendered with exquisite specificity, using her deafness not as a deficit but as a distinct mode of perceiving the world. Her motivation—to break the numbness of her students—is felt in every beat, and her interaction with the children at the end provides a resonant emotional payoff. The students, while initially a collective entity, gain sharp focus through Jorin, grounding the climax in a specific human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct and disciplined, perfectly embodying the "meticulous storm recorder" persona. The shift from passive observation to active "alignment" with the resistance is earned through consistent internal logic, satisfying the quick test for contradictory impulses (fear vs. integrity) resolving with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is compellingly drawn, with the trait of being "aromatically cautious" creating immediate, character-specific friction against the plot's demand. The transition from resistance to vulnerability feels earned by the specific sensory memories of the accident, grounding the emotional release in established backstory rather than melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the prompt's philosophical inquiry rather than a living character; their interiority is summarized and diagnostic ("my choices were... between shrinking and expanding") rather than embodied. The poet functions as a "magical mentor" trope, delivering wisdom in prepared speeches rather than interacting organically, and the voices for both characters blur into the same high-register poetic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elio’s acoustic hyper-perception is not merely a trait but the lens through which he engages the world, motivating his isolation and eventual connection. The decision to empty the bowl is a earned renunciation, grounded in the interaction with Mara and the "unfinished" philosophy, demonstrating a clear shift in values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Character motivation is starkly defined and drives the encounter; the internal conflict between the need for professional clarity and the sterility of that clarity is compelling. Eve’s "auditor" persona justifies the precise, analytical interiority, avoiding the trap of unearned self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's pivotal internal shift—the softening of his "shrewd" nature—occurs largely off-page or in summary before the scene begins, leaving the on-page action feeling like a victory lap rather than a crucible. The "odd new resolve" is stated as a premise rather than earned through dramatized struggle, making his sudden altruism feel convenient for the plot rather than rooted in character psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elian is clearly defined with a specific vocation and motivation, but his internal journey lacks friction; the transition from solitary to communal feels smooth and inevitable rather than earned through struggle or contradiction. The connection with Mira is functional but lacks the texture of a relationship formed under pressure, serving primarily to deliver the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "natural history illustrator" persona is perfectly maintained, shaping perceptions ("warped outlines") and driving the final moral choice to sketch rather than capture. The shift from employee to arbiter is earned through the sensory pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exemplary; Corren's specific trait of being "gently inventive" directly drives the resolution, turning a necromantic crisis into a moment of acceptance. The internal conflict between grief and mathematical logic is embodied in action, and the shift from retrieval to survival is earned by the on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marrow is a consistent, fable-like focalizer, but his kindly nature is static; he faces no internal contradiction or difficult trade-off to achieve his goal. The librarian functions as a prop for Marrow's intervention rather than a fully realized character, with his distress signaled by generic markers (crumpled diagnosis) rather than specific, embodied behavior before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s internal rigidity is well-dramatized through her interaction with the nursery, creating a clear character arc. Her backstory anchors her need for control, though the "shy part" interiority feels slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s specific neurosis (insomnia) is seamlessly integrated as a survival trait that enables the plot; only an insomniac painter would be awake to witness the tide’s failure and follow the rain trails to the brooch. Her transition from observer to actor is earned through the internal logic of "threshing meaning," and the choice to leave the island carries visible emotional cost. The internal contradiction—skepticism versus "wryly earnest" belief in omens—drives the pivotal decision to treat the brooch as currency.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra is a well-realized focalizer; her anxiety and physical "tells" (polishing lenses) ground her characterization effectively. Her internal shift from authority to witness is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, though the transition feels slightly accelerated given the short word count. The power dynamic with Mira flips cleanly, driven by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose interiority ("reactively visionary") translates into concrete action (charting absences, placing the valve). Her choice to offer the fragment back to the crowd rather than hoarding it demonstrates clear agency and character growth. The interaction with Old Caven provides a satisfying emotional payoff rooted in her established empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Adrian is a sharply drawn protagonist whose "analytically artistic" temperament drives his actions and perception. His interiority is distinct, grounding the supernatural elements in a specific worldview ("geometry in grocery lists"). While his acceptance of the impossible role is swift, it aligns well with his established curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s internal progression from defensive rationality to a "spacious" acceptance is well-charted and grounded in specific grief ("spoke over her absence, never into it"). The contradiction between her skepticism and her willingness to engage the artifact drives the narrative effectively, avoiding stock reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, successfully blending world-weary immortality with curiosity. The internal shift from seeking safety to accepting "direction" is legible and meaningful. However, the character is somewhat passive in the middle section, receiving the core realization via a lecture from the artifact rather than through active struggle or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's arc from "honest child" holding coats to an active architect of a new deception is compelling and causally earned. The internal conflict is embodied in the physical action of the autopsy, and the final choice reflects a profound shift in identity (redefining honesty as a "living imbalance").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurelio is a deeply realized focalizer whose profession as a gilded-leaf stationer permeates his worldview ("empty as paper," "burnished edges"). His motivation—to populate the silence with "invented histories"—is distinct and drives the narrative ritual with clear internal logic. The shift from writing stories to creating an "index" for the silence demonstrates a character-specific pivot in tactics that earns the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is largely passive, defined by observation rather than action; he "decided," "moved," and "rented" in summary rather than facing dramatized choices. Motivation is abstract ("discover the texture of memories") and interiority relies on poetic assertion rather than conflicting impulses under pressure. The character reads more as a thematic vessel than a person driving events.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tamsin’s internal conflict—skepticism versus a longing for meaning—is sharply drawn and embodied in the "sour kernel" of her central question. The shift from bitterness to "gloomy cheerfulness" is earned through the specific, painful confrontation with her memories, specifically the shame regarding her lover. The characterization avoids simple epiphany, opting for a complex emotional reconfiguration that aligns perfectly with her myth-busting persona.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Jae’s internal conflict between the Council and Carnival Row is well-dramatized through action rather than just thought. However, the introduction of the specific trait "orderly intuitive" as a nickname friends use ("friends called me Jae, the orderly intuitive") reads as unnatural exposition and strains credibility. The protagonist's competence is otherwise displayed convincingly through the translation of data into graffiti.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilya is a sharply realized protagonist whose professional competence conflicts with his sentimental curiosity. The internal struggle—wishing to be inspected himself, the temptation to lie to save the site—is dramatized efficiently in the short space. The relationship with the daughter, mediated through the chemical vials, provides deep emotional stakes without needing her on-page presence.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is well-grounded in his sensory limitations, creating a distinct, embodied experience. However, he functions more as a sage archetype than a conflicted protagonist; his "magnetic calm" precludes genuine struggle or internal contradiction. Clara acts primarily as a prompt-delivery device for thematic exposition rather than a source of interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s transition from bureaucratic caution to radical revision is expertly dramatized through interiority and action. The specific professional urge—the "twitch" to correct—grounds the motivation, making the final act of rebellion feel inevitable and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ansel functions as a static archetype rather than a complex character; he encounters no internal doubt or contradictory impulses. His "infinite patience" serves as a label to smooth over the struggle, and his success feels pre-ordained rather than earned through a difficult, defining choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s transition from a weary observer to a devoted guardian is compelled by a distinct, embodied internal conflict between training and intuition. The choice to "surrender" to the vial is a credible renunciation of a dead world, earned by the sensory isolation established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's active trait of "listening" transforms a passive confinement into agency, grounded effectively in a conflicted legacy. The transition from the father's historical failure to the son's potential success is motivated by specific internal logic and yields a distinct worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's motivation shifts abruptly from detachment to lifelong servitude. While the returned memory provides a reason, it functions as a magical bypass for genuine internal struggle; the "doubts" mentioned are stated rather than dramatized, making the surrender feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orren is a consistent, distinct focalizer whose poetic worldview shapes the narration. However, his agency feels somewhat abstract; the shift from recording to rewriting is driven by "memories not his own" (via the sleepwalking element), which slightly externalizes the pivotal realization. The internal conflict is quiet, lacking a sharp moment of contradictory impulse before the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is stated in exposition ("privately she wanted to restore lost faith") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. The protagonist faces no genuine internal opposition or flaws; her interactions smooth over potential friction without personal cost, making her feel more like a plot vehicle than a complex character.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    Neve’s professional expertise ("controlled reincarnation") perfectly mirrors their internal struggle, creating a cohesive character logic. The decision to use the private "chalk code" on an official form reveals a specific, risky vulnerability that deepens characterization significantly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora is a compelling focalizer whose internal contradiction—official embroiderer vs. secret listener—drives the narrative logic. The "foolishness" disguise is dramatized effectively through the pricked finger, establishing her control over the status dynamic. Her final choice to offer a map of absence is perfectly aligned with her established motivation to preserve unheard stories.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lysa is a capable, empathetic protagonist whose internal conflict (the arrogance of translation vs. the need to heal) drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct; she actively commands the spirits and interprets the vision, rather than passively observing. The interplay of professional detachment and "fierce tenderness" creates a grounded emotional center.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal conflict between neutrality and compassion is vividly dramatized. The choice to "graft new meaning" by lying about the smudged cast message serves as a decisive micro-choice with felt emotional cost. Her role as "reluctant confessor" is earned through action, not just exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio is a distinct, well-motivated protagonist whose internal landscape matches the story's atmospheric tone. The shift from seeking isolation to embracing a communal role ("traveling orchard") is a clear, earned arc. The internal conflict is resolved through the artistic act, though the emotional cost remains somewhat low-stakes and cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is functional, but the motivation is delivered via abstract exposition ("wanted to exchange certainty for curiosity") rather than dramatized struggle. Attributes like being called "vivid" feel like unearned authorial labeling rather than traits revealed through friction or distinct behavior. The internal shift is tracked, but the emotional arc feels somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the internal motivation is clear, anchoring the "rogue scholar" persona. However, the supporting cast lacks interpersonal friction; the group functions as a seamless unit, which lowers the dramatic pressure and "crucible" effect of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist fits the fable-like tone well, possessing a clear vocation and immediate goal. However, the motivation ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") feels more like a stated tagline than a dramatized psychological engine, and his internal struggle is minimal; he acts without significant hesitation or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s internal crisis—realizing his own namelessness—effectively grounds the high-concept premise in emotional reality. His choice to archive the song despite this personal "vertigo" demonstrates clear agency and sacrifice. The "inherited prayers" of his movement establishes deep competence without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between cowardice and the need for connection is vividly dramatized through the interaction with the magical grammar. The decisive choice to accept a permanent constraint on speech demonstrates strong agency and establishes a credible change in character state.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exemplary; Arlen's machinist worldview permeates his perception ("encrypted compassion"). The forensic analysis of the adhesive effectively dramatizes his hyper-observance and empathy without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character interiority is vivid, capturing Noel's specific, music-tinged perception of the world. However, the pivotal shift in his motivation—from defensive hiding to trusting the woman—is handled in a summary line ("learning to trust again") rather than a dramatized beat, which softens the earned nature of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Map’s internal landscape is seamlessly integrated with the surreal physics of her world, making her obsession with decoding the furniture feel inevitable rather than plotted. Her agency drives the climax—moving the chair precipitates the fall—and her final renunciation (the decision not to cross) is a powerful moment of Earned Stasis. The emotional cost of the "sacred ache" is palpable and grounded in the specific constraints of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's specific skillset ("landscape astrologer") is seamlessly integrated into their worldview and problem-solving method. Interiority regarding the fire and the "ache to belong" feels grounded and embodied, not just stated. Mira serves as a solid, if slightly passive, foil who enables the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a specific worldview ("bright sort of sorrow"). However, his role is largely observational; the decision to follow the seeds is driven by idle conjecture rather than desperate necessity or high-stakes pressure, limiting the emotional weight of his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marcus is a distinct, sharply defined protagonist whose analytical interiority ("read them like a position midgame") drives the narrative logic. The shift from performer control to shared human connection is earned, culminating in a genuine internal release ("purpose unclench").

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is sharply defined by the "elective exile" and the specific, heartbreaking cost paid at the climax (loss of the brother's face). This tangible sacrifice elevates Mareh from a functional archetype to a fully realized protagonist with a distinct moral economy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s voice is distinct, grounded in a specific trade that colors their worldview convincingly ("glass, too, is only sand convinced to stand still"). However, the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing rather than embodied emotion, making the glazier feel more like a vessel for metaphor than a person in crisis. The motivation to "illuminate value" is clear, but the internal struggle feels somewhat static until the final decision to delay.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rafe’s internal landscape is vivid, marked by specific sensory details like the "map of old burns." However, his motivation is occasionally articulated through diagnostic self-analysis ("translate all this pain," "enlighten another soul") rather than purely embodied action, which slightly distances the reader from the raw cost of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn as a "logical dreamer," a trait that drives the narrative method (using tools to measure intangible hope). The internal conflict between the "cautious professor" and the "panicked saboteur" is effectively dramatized through the choice to test the "ugly pattern." The "grief" felt for the "Unlifted" timelines provides necessary emotional ballast, grounding the intellectual experiment in felt cost. A brief moment of idealized character projection ("children learned statistics by tracking kindness") feels slightly less earned than the grittier realization of stagnation, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's specific expertise and sensory interiority create a compelling, grounded perspective. The shift from professional detachment to personal stewardship is motivated by the discovery, though the sense of "kinship" with Mara feels slightly rushed to bridge the emotional gap. The final renunciation of the "simple commission" in favor of the burden demonstrates clear agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mirage painter is a compelling, mythic figure with a distinct interiority ("borrowed heartbeat"). However, the central choice—helping the girl despite the cost—lacks sufficient friction; the assent ("nodded and shifted the melody") is immediate, making the protagonist’s sacrifice feel effortless rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The negotiator is realized with distinct, embodied interiority; the sensation of &quot;sand between teeth&quot; perfectly physicalizes the moral cost of his profession. His contradictory impulses—disgust at the terms versus the necessity of stopping the killing—drive the scene's central friction. The parallel drawn between his discipline and the general's &quot;operatively gentle&quot; demeanor adds depth to his characterization as a veteran of a different theater.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's "amoral" persona is rigorously maintained even during the sentimental climax, creating genuine friction. The transition from cynicism to the "ludicrous" act of devotion is earned through the specific obsession with the "echo," avoiding cheap redemption or character inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Iri is a distinct, agentic protagonist who drives the narrative, but her competence borders on infallibility, reducing tension. She faces no internal doubt or operational difficulty during the harvest; the "unreadable" persona acts as armor that prevents reader intimacy with her struggle. The choice to commit treason is high-stakes, but the ease with which she executes it makes her feel more like a force of nature than a vulnerable character.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's arc from an "uncommonly serene" pose of detachment to a vulnerable admission of arrogance is compelling and earned by the scene's pressure. The internal contradiction between their "urbane" persona and the "dirty work" of the puppets drives the conflict effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Erin's characterization is deeply woven into the narrative's lyric mode; she is defined by her "esoteric realist" work, which is dramatized through the specific action of tying and building. Her internal conflict—the "knot" of helplessness from past failures versus the urge to act—is resolved through the physical labor of assisting the monarch, creating a satisfying emotional arc. The transition from grief to architectural intervention is well-earned and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is rich, filtering the world entirely through the specific lexicon of their craft (wax, bronze, sprues). The shift from denial (“I told her I had none left”) to acknowledgement of the guilt is well-dramatized through the reaction to the scrap. The professional interiority grounds the magical elements in a tangible, lived-in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict is tightly wound around his unique name and function, creating a compelling arc from obedience to existential risk. The "wiry indeterminacy" of his character serves the transition well, though the attribute of being "precisely playful" is summarized rather than fully dramatized in dialogue. The final choice feels deeply rooted in his specific desire to "live wrongly" rather than just survive.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tammuz is drawn with sharp, specific contradictions—a scientist using numbers as prayers—that fuel the narrative engine. His internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from rigid expectation to "usable doubt" feels earned by the on-page experiment. The "empirically ironic" trait is slightly expository, but his actions consistently dramatize this friction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal conflict is sharply drawn, and the pivot from resentment to guilt is a credible psychological deepening. Ilen serves as an effective, if slightly didactic, catalyst for the protagonist's realization. The emotional arc feels earned, moving beyond simple forgiveness to a complex admission of culpability.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias functions well as a fable archetype with clear motivation and competence. While interiority is somewhat stylized to fit the genre rather than psychologically deep, his specific "habit of noticing" and the struggle to maintain self-definition against the dream's pull provide sufficient grounding for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the emotional arc relies heavily on nostalgic assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The repeated use of the label "endearingly feisty" for the daughter flattens her into a trope rather than a specific presence. The internal shift is catalyzed by a magical vision rather than a hard character choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a compelling vessel for the premise, and his internal overflow is well-rendered. However, the trait "simply complicated" functions as a label rather than a driver of behavior until the final beat. His shift from avoidance to acceptance provides a clear arc, though his agency is somewhat reactive to the setting's aggression until the mirror breach.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lysa's motivation is clearly dramatized through the specific action of mapping gaps, and the final choice is a character-defining moment of acceptance over correction. The internal conflict between rescuing and accepting is resolved with distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's envy and eventual surrender are emotionally coherent, but the "chimera twin discoverer" profession reads more like a prompt label than a lived reality with specific tools or protocols. The internal pivot is earned, yet the twin functions largely as a symbolic foil rather than a fully autonomous character.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lysa is a competent focalizer with a clear worldview ("warmly methodical"), but she functions more as a device than a character under pressure. She faces no internal resistance or meaningful choice; finding a note from herself removes the need for genuine adaptability or decision-making. The lack of a felt personal cost or hesitation leaves her arc feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is defined by high competence and sensory attunement, fitting the mythic mode. However, he lacks internal conflict or a difficult choice under pressure; his actions are procedural enactments of skill rather than decisions with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—to prove the metaphysical weight of coincidence—is distinct and compels him to physical extremes, elevating a standard survival task into a philosophical quest. His retrocognitive ability is treated not as a superpower but as a burdened perspective that deepens his isolation, and the final realization of his own voice closes his arc with profound, character-specific resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist is well-defined by his profession and the specific emotion of "preemptive nostalgia," which grounds the fantastical premise in felt experience. While his internal conflict is somewhat quiet—he serves the process without significant deviation—the final realization of his own place within the memory system provides a satisfying deepening of character.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist is a well-realized archetype grounded by specific, vulnerable habits (the nonsensical rhymes, the "ache shaped like a question mark"). His motivation to treat despair as a design flaw is compelling and drives the narrative logic. The interaction with the captain effectively establishes his status and the stakes without needing excessive dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's vocation is not just a label but a lens that colors every perception, creating a distinct and consistent interiority. The emotional shift from resistance to acceptance is earned through the specific metaphor of the cicada and the tide, grounding the epiphany in character traits rather than plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal world is vivid and idiosyncratic, grounding the abstract premise in felt experience. The father's transformation from critic ("design flaw") to participant is earned through the shared pressure of the inversion, culminating in a poignant moment of vulnerability. The relationship dynamics shift credibly within the short scope, moving from judgment to a shared vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rian is a distinct focalizer whose "fluidly logical" nature integrates well with the experiment's design. While his competence is high, the lack of deeper personal risk or harder obstacles limits the emotional weight of his victory; the passengers function effectively as archetypes to serve the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilya's internal conflict regarding the weight of memory is well-rendered, grounding his final refusal in a consistent worldview. The "wisely adventurous" trait appears as a functional label rather than a dramatized quality, but his specific burden as Lore Keeper drives the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s internal desperation is well-rendered, and her specific history of "burning bridges" provides a solid anchor for her agency. However, her epiphany relies heavily on the Shadow Keeper’s diagnostic dialogue rather than a purely dramatized internal shift, and the emotional resolution leans slightly into therapeutic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara's internal landscape—a repentant scammer converting guilt into stewardship—is deeply integrated with the story's high-concept premise. The specific detail of learning "interest rates the way some people learned fire" grounds her motivation perfectly in voice and history.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurel's internal burden as the "custodian of ghosts" is rendered with palpable weight, creating a strong emotional anchor. The shift from his perceived power to his realization of the Queen's prior surrender offers a meaningful deepening of character. His motivation is clear and sustains the scene's tension without wavering.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's internal pivot from performing "virtue" to recognizing it as mere "choreography" is excellent, grounding the abstract motivation ("capture the shape of possibility") in a felt psychological cost. The realization that his allegiance was to "the idea of being needed" rather than the king provides a specific, character-driven engine for the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and her internal parallel between the archives and her own history adds depth. However, her characterization relies partly on summary ("broken-hearted archivist") rather than dramatized interpersonal friction until the visitors arrive. The choice to persist is earned, though the internal conflict remains somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lio is a distinct, sympathetic protagonist with solid interiority regarding the city's erasure. However, the attribute "resourceful" feels slightly "told" rather than dramatized; Lio follows a mystical trail rather than solving a tactical problem, which softens the agency in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's renunciation is earned through palpable burden and clear interiority. His decision to play "refusal" instead of notes is a decisive action that pays off the established character arc with visible cost (exile/isolation).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio is a distinct, well-realized focalizer whose obsessive need for order creates a clear baseline. The internal conflict—safety in sorting vs. the risk of understanding—is beautifully dramatized through the "monuments" and the final choice. The decision to plant is a decisive shift in agency that earns the character's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eli’s internal conflict between the tinkerer's desire for order and the reality of entropy is well-dramatized. The shift in his stance is earned through the journey, though the explicit statement of his "desire to befriend uncertainty" in the narration slightly undercuts the "show, don't tell" of the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eira’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional density, balancing her role as an alchemist with her grief. The shift from seeking understanding to actively overwriting the city's verdict ("redeem the word itself") demonstrates strong agency. The emotional logic of refusing closure in favor of "luminous regret" feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is a compelling, distinct focalizer with a clearly dramatized motivation rooted in specific backstory (the brother). While her competence is high and her internal landscape vivid, the scene lacks a moment where she is forced to make a difficult trade-off or overcome genuine internal resistance, limiting the depth of the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's transformation from victim to participant is powerfully charted through the reclamation of the "brace." The shift from an imposed reflex to a chosen angle ("brace was mine... preparatory") provides a distinct moment of agency that earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator's internal conflict—between the professional role of a "neutral" translator and the moral desire to honor overlooked histories—is compelling and resolves with earned shame. While the protagonist is somewhat passive during the central scene (receiving wisdom rather than seizing it), the final internalization of the cost is character-specific and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's world-weary expertise serves as a perfect lens for the supernatural, grounding the impossible in labor disputes and mechanical fatigue. The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" feels slightly constructed to fit the prompt, but the decision to act against training manuals reveals genuine character agency and curiosity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Ilen is a consistent, agentic archetype whose single-minded pursuit drives the narrative. However, he functions more as a mythic operator than a complex character; the text lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required to reach the highest bands of characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s transition from a "defunct" revolutionary to a curator of lost possibilities is emotionally resonant and drives the plot. The relationship with Elyas effectively externalizes the thematic conflict, though the reaction of the "younger archivists" feels slightly stock. The final choice to internalize the revolution rather than fight openly earns the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is vivid and functional; Elias’s physical intolerance for dishonesty ("wilts near dishonesty") serves as an immediate, embodied diagnostic tool that drives the plot. His choice to negotiate rather than force a repair demonstrates specific, competence-based agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct, voiced focalizer with a clear motivation ("where explanations fail"). However, he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his journey is a linear surrender to the "hinge" without significant hesitation, making him more of a vessel for the concept than a dynamic agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's internal state is clearly drawn, effectively linking her artistic background to the narrative arc. However, the pivotal realization relies on summary interiority ("She understood, without knowing how") rather than a fully dramatized emotional struggle, which slightly dampens the earned cost of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira is a coherent focalizer whose professional lens shapes the narrative, but he lacks internal contradiction or significant emotional risk. He functions primarily as an observer to unlock the puzzle; his "quietly driven" nature is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices or tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maris’s motivation to "uncover truth in tension" effectively drives her choice to abandon the safety of the zeppelin for the lagoon. The internal conflict between professional detachment and the need to witness is resolved through the physical act of kneeling. Her agency is clear, though the "retrocognitive" visions momentarily risk overshadowing her active perception.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist is sharply drawn through a specific cognitive capacity ("working memory") that drives the plot. The transition from grief to constructive "reimagining" is motivated by his established trait of rejecting false comfort, making the climax feel earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lan is a distinct presence, grounded by the specific "rings of obligation" metaphor and the sensory memory of the classroom which particularizes his magic. His shift from procedural competence to horrified realization provides a clear, earned internal arc within the short scope. The "fracture" in Maro's speech is a strong character detail that hints at a larger world without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation to transition from saving seeds to saving time is logically sound and emotionally resonant. However, Myra functions primarily as an exposition delivery system, reading more like a quest-giver than a fully realized character in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary; Elias’s internal conflict between his duty to the instruments and his faith in "the quiet" is visceral and deeply embodied. The final choice to step away is a profound act of agency, effectively dramatizing a hierarchy of values where preserving communal trust outweighs immediate safety. The "humble" nature of his role contrasts beautifully with the god-like weight of his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist's internal arc relies on diagnostic label-speak ("He realized... was not merely expanding... it was also resting") rather than embodied action. This intellectualization of the emotional peak distances the reader from the "strength in vulnerability" shift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and specific ("trusted silence more than speech"), anchoring the "recluse" archetype in genuine motivation. The interaction with Mara is laden with history and subtext, avoiding exposition dumps while conveying deep connection. The choice to open the box feels inevitable yet costly, driven by a consistent internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, transforming an abstract motivation ("understand the texture of time") into concrete action (garage sale messages). The shift from passive observer to active participant ("teach the town how to float") is earned by the escalating pressure of the leak. The final realization ("we were the ones doing the lending") serves as a profound, character-specific reconfiguration of their identity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elian reads as a thematic archetype rather than a complex character; he lacks contradictory impulses or internal friction. His motivation is stated ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") and immediately fulfilled without testing or struggle. The absence of a "crucible" or felt cost keeps him static; he begins and ends as a perfect vessel for the story's moral.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is sharply defined by the diagnosis, driving a clear shift from passive maintenance to urgent creation. The protagonist’s internal state ("brazen calm") effectively masks vulnerability, though the emotional landscape feels somewhat linear, lacking contradictory impulses or moments of doubt during the execution phase.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's specific "luminous skepticism" acts as a compelling filter for all observation, creating a distinct and consistent internal voice. The internal arc from academic rebellion to a shared, humble "waiting" at the end marks a clear, earned reconfiguration of stance with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman is a compelling, specific focalizer with deep interiority anchored in a distinct worldview. His motivation—fidelity to the botanist’s memory—is clear and drives the scene’s action. A slight reliance on summary for the botanist’s history prevents the highest band, but the emotional cost of his solitary duty is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivation is layered (atoning for erasing voices by preserving them), and the internal conflict drives the decision to share the cylinder. Barrow serves as an effective emotional mirror, grounding the narrator's solitary existence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian’s internal landscape is richly drawn, grounding the high-concept setting in a specific, felt history with his mother. The tension between his role as the "blessed pariah" and his private ritual creates a credible, embodied motivation. His final refusal to turn is a decisive micro-choice that perfectly crystallizes his character’s values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but interiority leans into diagnostic self-summary ("longed, beneath the swagger") rather than embodied reaction. The "chivalrous thief" persona feels slightly performative, and the internal shift is eased by the object's invitation rather than a difficult active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's backstory as a "crisis actor real crisis survivor" creates a profound, embodied internal conflict that colors every observation. The transition from passive liaison to active historian is motivated by a desperate need to preserve truth against "staged" narratives. The reaction to the boy’s recitation—throat closing, silence—perfectly dramatizes the character's paralysis and subsequent resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (forgetting vs. remembering) is vividly embodied and resolved through a decisive, painful choice. The realization that erasure was "burial" rather than survival earns the reversal, with the cost ("cracking open a sealed room") palpably felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elior's characterization is tightly wound around the central metaphor of chess and strategy. The transition from the backstory of the prince's death to the present challenge of the tapestry is seamless, providing clear, character-specific motivation. His internal arc—moving from the guilt of precision to the acceptance of messy survival—drives the plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zev and Maren interact with palpable friction, turning the scene into a genuine crucible of character. Maren's shift from seeking "cheap" forgiveness to accepting a fragmented, painful truth is a well-earned internal arc. The "innocently mischievous" trait feels slightly pasted on via labels rather than fully embodied, but the underlying motivation drives the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.7)
    Corin’s internal conflict (doubt vs. hope) drives the narrative effectively, and the shift from “uncertain alchemist” to narrator is legible. However, his epiphany relies heavily on abstract summary ("He understood then that his task was...") rather than purely dramatized emotion, making the internal change feel slightly intellectualized rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, fitting the nostalgic archetype, but the trait "intimately aloof" relies on expository summary rather than enacted behavior or choice. Motivation is clear, yet the lack of significant internal resistance or contradictory impulses flattens the character arc into a smooth execution of intent without a distinct psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, though the "reluctant" trait is asserted rather than dramatized in her swift, competent action. Her internal state is vivid, but the lack of hesitation or significant internal obstacle makes her success feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    Rian is a compelling, distinct protagonist whose "patchwork" nature mirrors the thematic action of reconstructing a broken world. The pivotal choice to lie offers a profound glimpse into a value system that prioritizes solace over truth, earning the emotional weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "involuntarily truthful" trait is well-dramatized in the interaction with Risa, creating immediate friction and "fractured grace." However, the protagonist's self-definition as "rational" clashes with their highly lyrical, metaphorical internal monologue ("nervous ligaments," "chewed its walls"), creating a voice-character mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's shift from detached investigator to active witness is compelling and well-motivated by the encounter. While the Keeper serves as an effective catalyst, he leans heavily into a "mystical guide" archetype, existing primarily to dispense wisdom rather than functioning as a fully embodied individual.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated by loss, and his internal state of "rusting decisions" is evocative. However, the specific trait "empirically intuitive" feels mechanically inserted to justify the whimsical action of following ants, rather than reading as an organic aspect of his psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Isera’s weariness is palpable and the "softly commanding" dynamic with Ralen effectively establishes authority without exposition, but her internal struggle is minimal. The decision to abandon duty for destiny is made instantly with little friction, reducing the weight of the choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s interiority is rich and distinct, successfully blending the scientific and romantic worldviews without cliche. The motivation—to bottle "the density of presence"—is established early and pays off beautifully in the specific choice to help the friends, showing a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's specific professional weariness ("I call it my job") grounds the surreal premise effectively. The internal arc—shifting from a corrosive jealousy of his "cleaner" past selves to a "jaded wonder" at the complexity of the whole—is distinct, earned, and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara’s interiority is distinct, but the engineer relies on functional stereotypes ("I am an engineer, I do not know how to read pauses") to serve the plot. The emotional connection feels slightly performed rather than organic, with characters articulating their arcs too neatly for a high-stakes emotional crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lan's internal landscape of fear and memory is vivid, and the translation of trauma into magic provides a strong, coherent arc of growth. However, the "crystallization" of his thoughts feels more like a mechanical superpower triggered by the prompt than an organic psychological trait, and his success proceeds somewhat linearly under the Master's instruction rather than through desperate, autonomous agency.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mirabel is a compelling focalizer whose professional identity ("gossip-column exorcist") directly conflicts with her personal need for atonement. The internal struggle is not abstract but dramatized through the ritual; her decision to dismantle her own "metaphorical" shield to offer a raw confession marks a profound, earned shift in character stance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist functions effectively as a mythic archetype suited to the fable-like mode, but lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for higher bands. While the "surrender of the pronoun" suggests depth, his choices unfold as obedient execution of a ritual rather than a struggle between competing values or desires.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—duty versus the desire for existential truth—is compelling and clearly dramatized through his refusal to enter the control room. The final choice to renounce the key is a strong, character-specific beat that prioritizes integrity over the comfort of illusion, earning the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is vivid, shifting credibly from "intrusion specialist" to "opener of doors" via specific beats. However, the self-diagnosis ("I am, inconveniently, spatially gifted") and abstract motivation ("physics of letting go") lean on diagnostic labels rather than purely dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, filtering the world effectively through her probability-focused lens ("time had split," "chased impossible odds"). The tension between her cautious nature ("design safety nets") and the final risk she takes in the hospital is a strong character arc. However, her core motivation ("widen perspectives responsibly") feels slightly expository and told rather than purely dramatized until the final beat. The father’s characterization is vivid, though his transition to "counting breaths" relies on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s "cultivated estrangement" is a precisely drawn worldview that motivates her interaction with the outside world, creating a distinct and compelling character signature. Her desire to "teach endings how to begin" drives the scene effectively, turning a passive role into an active intervention. While the emotional cost to Lena herself is somewhat abstract (remaining in the tunnel), the consistency of her internal logic and voice is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s internal landscape is vivid, merging role ("walnut-ink archivist") with embodied grief ("locket... like a second, stubborn heart"). The impulse to preserve weight vs. the pain of the lost friend creates a solid emotional anchor. The characterization relies more on lyrical role-fulfillment than sharp psychological contradiction, but it fits the fable-like mode perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Character interactions are sharp and the disaster-logistician archetype offers a fresh lens on the "magical guide" figure. Kenji's internal state is clearly drawn, though his pivotal moment of reciprocity is summarized rather than dramatized—we see him listen, but the "truest thing" he delivers in return remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orrin is a compelling focalizer whose physical constraint (blindness) organically shapes the narrative's unique sensory texture. The shift from seeking external ghosts to confronting internal avoidance acts as a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration. While the backstory voices are efficiently sketched, the final decision to "stay" and map the self lands with genuine, dramatized emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, anchored by a compelling mix of guilt and curiosity. However, the emotional redemption feels slightly unearned; the specific regret regarding the "child whose medication I miscalculated" is a heavy stake to introduce and then resolve via a magical nudge without a commensurate visceral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena’s interiority and emotional burden are drawn with sensitivity, and her motivation to translate silence is compelling. However, the Advisor functions almost exclusively as a plot device to facilitate the solution, lacking independent texture or resistance. Lena’s agency is somewhat dampened because the methodology is handed to her rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—destructive remorse versus constructive preservation—is palpable and drives the narrative. The voice is distinct and consistent, and the final decision to stay and "stitch" rather than destroy acts as a powerful, earned renunciation of their past identity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to resist is clear and drives the scene, but the interiority relies heavily on metaphor rather than specific, grounded emotion. The connection to the "other" feels instant and convenient, lacking the friction or complexity of a genuine relationship formed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    Milo is a static archetype of competence who faces no internal friction or doubt; his "wizardry" solves the external problem immediately without requiring a difficult choice, sacrifice, or exposure of a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dentist's internal conflict is embodied well through the "broken teeth" metaphor and the use of the mirror. The Guardian's mythic patience provides a strong counterpoint. The dentist's nervous behavior with the shutters is slightly contrived physically but serves the fable-like logic effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Daniel is a coherent, consistently motivated protagonist whose chess metaphor nicely frames his worldview. However, he lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; his path is linear and noble without a "shadow side" or moment of doubt to deepen the characterization. The lack of a difficult micro-choice limits the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara serves primarily as an atmospheric vessel for the setting rather than a fully realized agent. While her physical grace is established, her internal arc is resolved via a prompt-inserted realization ("She knew her only wish...") rather than earned through dramatic friction or choice. The shift from "barbed words" to "embracing true nature" feels mandated by the prompt list rather than driven by the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The performer’s internal rebellion is sharply drawn, contrasting effectively with their "blank face" persona. The motivation to "cultivate lightness in grief" drives every beat, creating a cohesive arc of subversion. Mara’s passivity serves the story well as the canvas for the performer’s work, and the shared moment at the end feels earned by the specific character dynamics established.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lio is consistent in his introspection, but his identity as a "cloud-shadow poet" relies heavily on expositional labels rather than active behavior. The pivotal shift from fear to the "tremor of certainty" occurs internally without an acute on-page pressure to force the crystallization, making his agency feel somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira’s specific perceptual constraint—seeing textures instead of colors—deeply informs her worldview and choices. Her decision to accept the impossible commission is rooted in a clearly dramatized internal trait ("innocently cunning heart") that transforms a label into narrative agency.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elya’s internal conflict between the metrics-driven mandate and her desire for authentic connection is well-drawn and drives the narrative. The visitor serves as a necessary catalyst, though their arrival is slightly convenient and their dialogue leans toward thematic exposition rather than natural speech. The emotional shift is earned through introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ela’s internal landscape of grief is rendered with exquisite texture, and her shift from mourning to "shaky arcs" of hope is beautifully described. However, the summary nature of the narrative distances us from the specific, high-pressure micro-choices that define character agency; her transformation feels more like a result of time passing than a singular, dramatized struggle. Riv is a compelling counterpoint, though his role is primarily that of a catalyst rather than an active participant in a shared crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is well-rendered through the lens of her ritual, establishing a distinct worldview. However, the dialogue often serves as a vehicle for thesis statements rather than character revelation, making the interaction feel slightly staged rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hiran is a compelling focalizer whose internal conflict—institutional training vs. intuitive hunger—drives the narrative. The transition from historian to vessel is earned through on-page choices (opening the doors in sequence) that carry clear, escalating risk. The final decision to accept "Earned Stasis" by staying underground is a decisive, high-cost resolution to his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lio’s desire to make his regret "useful" establishes a compelling, melancholic motivation that drives his final sacrifice. However, the protagonist's connection to the specific anomaly relies heavily on the Overseer’s exposition rather than an earned discovery, and his immediate acceptance of the burden lacks the internal friction or hesitation that would maximize the emotional weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s internal landscape of guilt is palpable and complex, avoiding simple victimization. However, the reliance on a dense expository block ("Her convictions had seemed...") to explain her past shifts the mode to diagnostic summary, momentarily distancing the reader from her immediate embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is a compelling, introspective narrator with a clear internal conflict (closure vs. reopening). However, the external dialogue from the plants functions as "therapeutic mirrors," articulating her subconscious flaws ("You are built like a key, not a lock") with diagnostic precision. This externalizes the theme too conveniently, telling the reader the character's arc rather than letting her discover it through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and specific, grounding the magical premise in a distinct emotional need ("secret egg under the ribs"). The "spatially imaginative" trait adds texture to her perception, though the projectionist functions more as a thematic guide than a fully realized character with independent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is clear, and the recontextualization of "rest" provides a solid arc. However, interiority relies heavily on metaphorical summaries (e.g., "terror and longing braided together") rather than embodied sensation, creating a slight distance during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator is a compelling, distinctive focalizer whose internal landscape of loss and duty is rendered with high specificity. The "dreamless freight guard" persona is sustained perfectly through voice and perception, and the choice to maintain the vigil functions as a poignant Earned Stasis. Interiority is deep and avoids stock phrasing, grounding the surreal premise in felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.7)
    The "stray philosopher" persona feels like a convenient label rather than an embodied character; interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("corners of reality began to peel back"). There is little internal conflict or contradictory impulse acting in scene; the protagonist moves through the beats without genuine struggle or shifting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is grounded in a specific, recent inciting incident, and her "ache" provides a clear internal drive. However, the guides function more as helpful plot devices than fully realized characters, offering passage without significant resistance or distinct personality beyond their archetypal wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between the safety of the "silent-choir" vow and the need for truth is compelling and drives the narrative arc. The dissociation between the regenerating body and the projecting mind provides a unique, surreal texture to the character's agency. Motivation shifts credibly from obedience to rebellion through the interaction with the guest.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The titan acts as a compelling archetype, but his struggle is largely summarized rather than dramatized through immediate, difficult choices on the page. He faces no internal contradiction or resistance that forces a high-stakes decision; his motivation ("intolerable" lie) is stated clearly but leads to a procedural montage rather than a pressurized scene. The scholar is a functional device for closure rather than a fully realized counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, merging professional competence ("counting numbers") with a distinct sensory history ("child of sonar"). The transition from passive observer to active participant is driven by a consistent, character-specific intuition. The tapping habit is beautifully integrated as both a coping mechanism and a narrative tool.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora creates a distinct focal point, and her internal landscape of "awkward confidence" is well-rendered through movement and proprioception. However, the pivotal shift from observer to instigator relies heavily on a sudden intellectual synthesis ("Maybe rebellion was...") rather than escalating pressure forcing the choice. The motivation to "discover meaning" is abstract, making the stakes feel slightly theoretical until the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Teta Lila is a distinct, resonant force whose "insurgent" backstory informs present action without stalling momentum. The narrator's internal conflict—caught between the plant-fear and the grandmother's resolve—drives the agency in the final release, making the mentor-student dynamic essential rather than expository.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mariam is a deeply realized focalizer; her physical symptoms (tremor, freezing) effectively ground the backstory in present action. The internal conflict—between the safety of the arboretum and the intrusion of traumatic memory—is handled with nuance. The choice to fold the photograph is a poignant micro-move that earns the stasis at the end, demonstrating resilience without erasing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's interiority is vivid, grounding the surreal premise in tangible grief and artistic frustration. The shift from paralysis to the specific ritual is character-consistent, though the motivation relies briefly on diagnostic phrasing ("fragmented reality") rather than purely dramatized struggle in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Iren’s motivation—to deconstruct the "mercy" of the Slow—is deeply rooted in a specific traumatic memory that avoids cliché through visceral detail ("grains of sand hanging"). His final choice to let his identity loosen feels earned by the prior characterization of his "half-vanished" nature, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ana’s internal arc from suppression to subversion is compelling and well-paced. The shift is grounded in concrete interiority ("shells were easier to stack"), and the final identity shift ("archivist and arsonist") feels earned. The prompt-mandated attribute "bravely conflicted" appears as a direct label, which is a minor "tell" flaw, but the surrounding dramatization of that conflict is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara is a consistent, idealized figure whose "senselessly perceptive calm" shields her from genuine internal struggle or error. While her pacifist stance is clear, her ability to effortlessly disarm antagonists makes her feel more like an archetypal force than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is visceral ("sharply than hunger") and drives a distinct, earned renunciation at the climax. The "transliterates emotions" attribute is efficiently established and beautifully paid off in the visualization of the echo, transforming a potential label into active perception. Internal conflict is palpable, and the final choice to refuse the "unanswerable question" feels consistent with his character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is precise and embodied; Elena’s hesitation counting the phone rings ("four would seem eager and six would seem afraid") immediately establishes her high-stakes discipline. The specific interiority ("tasting the substitution the way a typesetter tongues a bitten lip") grounds her abstract dilemma in her concrete background. The transition to "solemn playfulness" feels earned as a defense mechanism against the weight of the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—hoarding grief vs. releasing it—drives the narrative effectively. The translation gift is seamlessly integrated into the emotional arc, and the final renunciation of the private recording carries visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lark is a vividly drawn protagonist whose internal conflict—whimsy versus sacred weight—resolves through a credible, high-cost realization about her art's power. The "socially perceptive" trait is integrated well to drive the climax, though the secondary character (the boy) functions more as a prop for Lark's epiphany than a fully realized presence. The shift from "sidewalk dragons" to the frightening responsibility of "outlining chaos" is a strong, character-specific arc.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    Laleh is a distinct archetype with a clear worldview, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Her conviction is absolute from start to finish, making her a static vehicle for the ritual rather than a character making difficult trade-offs under pressure. The motivation is stated ("cradle empathy") rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marcel's depiction as a "fractured timeline in human shape" effectively dramatizes his internal conflict and ghost nature without resorting to clichés. Lina’s synesthesia is not just a trait but the lens through which she navigates the emotional landscape, grounding her motivation in visceral sensory experience. The interaction creates a credible "relationship as crucible" where they must synchronize to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Naya serves as an effective crucible, grounding Eli’s abstract crisis with concrete skepticism that pivots to support. Her shift from doubter to believer drives the resolution, though her acceptance of the supernatural element is slightly rushed for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Iri’s internal conflict between machine protocols and the role of a "listener" is effectively dramatized through the interaction with the leaf. The shift from observer to participant is earned, though the emotional cost of the final choice feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara has clear agency and a coherent motivation, but her internal landscape lacks the contradictory impulses required for higher bands; she acts more as a fable archetype than a conflicted individual. The "hourglass turner" title functions as a label rather than an integrated trait, as it implies skills or history that do not influence the scene or tactics. The emotional shift is stated ("suddenly certain") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, grounded protagonist with clear internal conflict. The shift from "burned spy" despair to the "unused courage" realization is effective, though the final epiphany relies on abstract thematic summary ("realized that was why...") rather than purely embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coachman’s interiority is distinct, blending professional weariness with a specific spiritual function. His motivation to "distill complexity" drives the scene’s resolution effectively. The interaction with the mother reveals his nature without heavy exposition, though the mother herself remains more of an archetypal figure than a fully realized agent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("zen-minded potter") rather than a fully realized individual; his internal state is static, observing alternate selves without genuine struggle or temptation on the page. While the motivation to understand the oasis is clear, the lack of friction or contradiction in his character reduces the narrative pressure to a fable-like observation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal pivot from "tending locks" to "reflecting light" is grounded in specific, embodied history. While the label "wistfully pragmatic" is a bit direct, her actions—using cracked teacups and building the mobile—make the trait distinct and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lio functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character, with the &quot;other self&quot; serving as a mouthpiece for exposition. The dialogue relies on diagnostic label-speak (&quot;mistook isolation for purity&quot;) that dissolves tension rather than embodying it in subtext or action. Interiority is summarized through abstract metaphors, keeping the emotional struggle distant.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's specific burden—the "private archive" of unsent letters—authentically drives the narrative arc, merging professional duty with personal release. The internal conflict is embodied in the physical weight of the satchel and the final creative act, earning the emotional shift at the closure without resorting to diagnostic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s transformation from a passive interpreter to a "gambler setting the table" is compelling and earned through high-pressure micro-choices. Her internal landscape is vivid, blending technical competence with cosmic wonder, and the final shift in stance feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's specific trait of being "prudently adventurous" is expertly dramatized through the use of the compass to navigate the spatial anomaly. The internal conflict between claustrophobia and the drive to uncover secrets is visceral and shapes the final choice. The decision to descend feels earned by the established character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is excellent; Jonas's prosopagnosia is not just a trait but a lens that defines his interaction with the world (seeing Rhea by motion) and his art. His motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" rather than punish creates a distinct moral stance. The internal consistency of his perception (planes/angles) is maintained flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motivation is deeply integrated; her choice to volunteer and subsequently decode the journals feels earned by the established ancestral connection. The "nervously confident" beat effectively bridges her discovery and action, showing interiority under pressure. Her final act of defiance is a credible evolution from the idealistic librarian to a participant in the resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("heart tuned to a luminous disbelief," "buried under itineraries") rather than grounded psychological contradiction. The "gift and curse" characterization is a stock phrase that flattens his complexity into a label.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending corporate disillusionment with a grifter's heritage effectively ("reading billboards like scripture"). Motivation is clear and interiority is concrete, though the protagonist remains physically passive, processing the stakes almost entirely through reflection rather than immediate interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a viewpoint for the concept rather than an agent of dramatic choice; he follows instructions from the telegram, the Director, and Aria without internal resistance. While the "lucid dream chronicler" identity is established, the emotional stakes of his "dreams outvoting waking life" are told rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page impulses or costly micro-choices. The relationship with Aria is frictionless and supportive, lacking the tension or status dynamics required to test his character.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Arlen’s specific gift and his internal landscape of "warlike serenity" ground the magical mechanics in character. The final choice to claim total guilt ("I changed everything") effectively dramatizes his desperate need for closure and transforms his grief into active power.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lio’s shift from skeptic to believer is efficiently handled via the scar mechanic, establishing a clear dynamic. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("anxious elation") rather than embodied reaction, which flattens the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's specific desire—not to erase the memory but to gain the strength to be a "witness"—elevates the character arc above standard regret tropes. Lio functions well as a catalyst, though his characterization relies slightly on stated labels ("reckless idealist") rather than demonstrated friction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli is a distinct, well-realized focalizer, and the transition from roadie to appraiser feels authentic. The internal conflict between his need for validation ("confidently uncertain") and his history is compelling. A slight deduction for the diagnostic interiority ("Loss, he told himself, was only a misalignment...") which reads more like therapy-speak than embodied thought in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exemplary; the protagonist's "kindly, methodical" nature is not just a label but the tactical engine that drives her unique solution to the crisis. The internal conflict between "haunted ambitions" and her patient desire for understanding is dramatized clearly, culminating in a choice that honors her established traits over generic survival instincts.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's specific physiology (titan-gear, hinge-hearted) is not merely ornamental but drives the resolution; the "furnace gears" in the chest provide the physical means to solve the central conflict. Motivation ("preserve wonder in routine") directly informs the choice to smelt the identities rather than simply archive them, earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist with a sharply defined internal conflict (survival vs. living) that mirrors her external role. Her vulnerability in the climax feels earned by her earlier observations of the "abandoned hopes." The characterization avoids cliché by grounding her abstract longing in the concrete details of her inspection work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's guilt is anchored in a devastatingly specific detail—selling the recording of the brother's death for an award—which creates immediate, high-stakes internal pressure. The shift from detached chronicler to grieving brother is earned through action, and the "river chronicler" persona provides a unique, character-specific lens for the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from ambitious cartographer to reverent witness is compelling and well-motivated by the setting's specific pressures. The visceral reaction to the &quot;unwritten apology&quot; grounds her fantastical quest in a distinct, embodied emotional reality. The shift in stance at the closure feels earned, driven by her specific experience with the library's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is sharply defined, balancing professional obligation against a magical/moral imperative. The protagonist’s internal conflict is embodied viscerally ("volume hurt," "blood in my ears"), and the final refusal is an active choice that accepts the cost of the empire's displeasure, earning the high grade.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara is a compelling professional whose duality (artist/priest) informs every action, grounding the magic in specific labor. The shift from professional detachment to personal risk is earned, and the specific micro-choice to place the chip on the sternum rather than the brow anchors the emotional climax in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (resentment vs. desire for peace) is clear, but the characterization relies heavily on exposition ("They trusted my kindly decisive way of speaking") rather than dramatized interaction. The emotional shift is earned through the visionary experience rather than active choices under pressure, making the protagonist feel more like a witness than an agent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's professional detachment ("hire a conscience") contrasts effectively with the intimate, empathetic nature of the work. Mara is sketched quickly but deeply, with her defensive posture and "sincerely insincere" expression grounding the emotional stakes. The interaction feels authentic to the established "therapy-noir" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character conception is exceptional, particularly Elian’s backward-aging constraint which directly shapes his teaching philosophy ("nothing but lessons, walking"). Mora’s internal shift from seeking spectacle to confronting the terror of erasure is dramatized through specific sensory experience, earning the final emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal discipline creates a compelling filter for the narrative, grounding the abstract concept of the "pulse" in concrete action. The shift from physical searching to internal stillness is well-motivated by the established trait of "waiting," leading to a character-specific resolution that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orren is a compelling protagonist whose history of failure perfectly contextualizes his rebellion against the automated world. His internal shift from resignation to risk is well-motivated by the tactile interaction with the keystone. The choice to unstrap the harness reveals character through action with high stakes. A slight over-articulation of his motive in the final paragraph ("finally understood he wanted to find...") tells rather than shows, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear yearning, but his climactic transformation relies heavily on summarized realization ("Elias realized," "he understood") rather than dramatized struggle. The shift from hiding behind truth to making a vow feels instantaneous and somewhat unearned by the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—between the comfort of random fate and the terrifying responsibility of choice—is dramatized with precision. The shift from "cast lots decision maker" to an agent of "unshared" will is earned through the visceral cost of "amputating" their function. Interiority is dense and character-specific, though the transition to trust relies heavily on the external message.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper’s motivation is clearly rooted in backstory (the child’s sacrifice), but he lacks active micro-choices under pressure in the present scene. He executes a competency (the ritual) without facing internal contradiction or a moment where he might fail, resulting in a static character portrait rather than a dynamic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Tamsin is a superbly realized protagonist; her "lukewarm" inadequacy and "naivete with teeth" drive her agency and the plot's resolution perfectly. Her internal landscape is specific and impactful, transforming a standard underdog trope into a fresh character study.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    Tomas is a deeply realized focalizer; his "precisely humane attention" coheres perfectly with his grief and professional duty. The internal shift from guarding structures to guarding stories is earned through specific sensory interactions with the debris, making the emotional arc feel authentic and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elian’s internal conflict between logic and sentiment is clearly defined and drives the climactic choice effectively. The "lullaby in pocket" feels like a slightly convenient character shorthand rather than a dramatized pressure, but the pivot to intuition at the end is earned by the scene's escalation. The "kin" realization offers a satisfying integration of his dual nature, though the "mother's whisper" backstory leans on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's competence is well-grounded in physical action ("muscle memory"), and the internal conflict is palpable. However, the character relies heavily on the grandmother's aphorisms ("Grandmother used to say") to articulate values, which feels slightly more expository than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal arc—from seeking feeling to accepting the pain of guilt—is dramatized beautifully through the combat mechanics. The realization that winning requires a monstrous numbness forces a choice that satisfies the internal motivation while imperiling the external goal. The distinction between Arin-prime and Arin-2 is efficiently drawn through their differing attachments to the origin.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a distinct, well-motivated protagonist whose contradictory impulses (paying rent vs. safeguarding innovation) drive the narrative. His trait of being "notably receptive" is not just a label but the engine for his interaction with the seed and his business philosophy. The internal shift is earned and creates a credible, character-specific resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lysander is a vividly drawn eccentric whose internal landscape ("carrying his grief like a tuning fork") perfectly matches his external actions. His specific, bizarre competence validates the story's surreal premise, and his persistence earns the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's "dimensional homesickness" creates a compelling, specific internal state that motivates every interaction. The guardian is equally distinct, and their friction reveals character depth without relying on exposition, satisfying the highest standards of characterization.

    Corren’s internal landscape of "ruined experiments" provides a strong, specific filter for his actions. While the motivation is compelling, the specific trait "stoically sensitive" relies on a direct label rather than being fully metabolized into behavior, though his interaction with the fire partially redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending mysticism with the dry pragmatism of an "accountant of miracles." The internal conflict—managing the city's suicidal ideation against the safety of the valley—forces a character-specific choice that prioritizes compromise over pure appeasement. The motivation to find "the beginning in every ending" perfectly frames the final negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eli is a distinct, obsessive protagonist whose interiority grounds the magical elements. However, the "resiliently positive" trait is explicitly labeled rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. The passengers' sudden, synchronized cooperation at the climax feels convenient, lacking the relationship development required to earn such a unified moment.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle with grief is embodied well through physical reactions ("chest tightened," "truth of it in my wrists"), grounding the abstract premise. The Architect serves as an effective, if slightly stylized, catalyst who forces the protagonist's agency to manifest. The final choice—refusing the binary of leaving or forgetting in favor of a "fastened" stasis—is a strong, character-driven moment that earns its emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing professional weariness with a persistent, specific yearning ("chased unfolded horizons"). The shift from reluctance to engagement is earned via the tactile memory of the chain link, grounding the motivation. The trait "balancedly curious" is delivered via exposition rather than action, which is a minor slip in an otherwise deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eren is a strongly realized protagonist with a specific, distinct worldview ("asked not just where someone died but what they had almost said"). His motivation is woven into his actions, and the choice to break protocol is well-supported by established traits. He borders on idealized—lacking a gritty internal flaw or hesitation that would heighten the personal stakes—but the execution is consistent and empathetic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Noah is a distinct, competent protagonist whose claustrophobia provides genuine, embodied texture ("crawled up from his spine") without reducing him to a caricature. The internal conflict between his mercenary trade and his deeper need to witness the forgotten is compelling, though the transition between these motives relies slightly on exposition ("Noah told himself...") rather than purely dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s "death certificate error" backstory and the resulting heartbeat-counting compulsion are seamlessly woven into the narrative present, creating a distinct, neurotic interiority. The closure—where he forgets to count—demonstrates a decisive internal shift (Resonant Reconfiguration) earned by the external breakthrough. The character's specific competence and vulnerability are balanced well.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is mythic yet grounded, defined by a unique trade and physical trait that pays off in the resolution. His internal drive to preserve language is clear, and the choice to merge his own voice with the canyon demonstrates agency with a felt cost. The "quietly articulate" trait is slightly over-labeled rather than purely dramatized, but his actions consistently reflect this nature.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—scientific taxonomy vs. anomalous reality—drives the narrative effectively. The "field liaison" persona crumbling in the face of the garden's truth creates a strong, authentic arc. The shift to the "cosmic joke" stance at the end feels slightly abrupt as an emotional resolution but works intellectually as a Conceptual Repricing of the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but his pivotal shift relies on an external command ("A thought came, not his own") rather than a purely internal evolution, creating a slight drag on agency. The interiority occasionally leans into summary labels ("fragile rebellions," "puzzled awareness") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eren is a distinct, motivated protagonist whose internal state aligns well with his external actions. His "respectfully rebellious" nature is dramatized through the mail delivery under drone surveillance, and the shared history with Mara adds depth. The "relationship as crucible" test is met in their exchange, though the dialogue leans slightly toward shared philosophy rather than distinct character conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Eli is a coherent focalizer, but his internal arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from a man who "kept his own heart stopped" to one singing a magical song occurs instantly upon touching the halo, bypassing the necessary struggle or decision-making that earns such a transformation. The characterization relies on stated attributes ("quietly persistent") rather than testing them under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mariel is a distinct focalizer with a specific, highly developed worldview that colors every observation. Her internal logic is consistent, but the story lacks an emotional crucible; her stakes remain purely intellectual, observing rather than risking personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Irena functions well as an atmospheric vessel, but her internal arc relies on asserted intuition ("began to suspect") rather than dramatized discovery. Her agency at the climax is passive endurance—waiting for the light—rather than an active, cost-laden choice that defines her character.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict—caught between the mother's inherited terror and the "trembling idea"—is visceral and drives the scene effectively. The embodiment of fear as a "rough wall" and a "clenched fist" grounds the abstraction well. The Locksmith functions perfectly as a catalyst, enigmatic yet distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the realization of the forgotten brother creates a potent, embodied emotional beat. The "chronically curious" trait drives the tactile engagement with the setting, though the final choice is framed somewhat tidily by the "complete vs. tidy" dichotomy rather than purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is incisive and economical; Rhea's contradictory "combative tenderness" is dramatized effectively in the final exchange. The integration of the specific physical trait (walking backwards) is exceptional, transforming a prompt requirement into a meaningful physicalization of her internal hesitation and duty. Jun's defiance is palpable, creating a genuine spark against Rhea's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation (escaping grayness) is clear, but they function primarily as a passive vessel for Lior’s lesson. The emotional arc relies on stated feelings ("hope had felt like a luxury") rather than dramatized micro-choices or resistance. Lior fills a standard archetype, guiding the protagonist without generating interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ilan is a functional, sympathetic focalizer with a clear skill set and motivation. However, the internal wound described as "a place in him that had never quite healed" remains a vague emotional placeholder rather than a specific, dramatized vulnerability. While his actions are consistent, the lack of a sharper personal stake in this specific restoration limits the depth of the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's interiority—specifically his "shielded openness" and professional habit of reading edges—drives the narrative focus effectively. His specific trade lens transforms the act of watching video into a character-specific beat, grounding the empathy in craftsmanship. The transition from guarded observer to empathetic interpreter is earned through these established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict is compelling, and the physical embodiment of grief ("tightening in my chest") is strong. However, the diagnostic label-speak ("I am, by temperament, quietly analytic") and the noir cliché ("first name basis with death") detract from the otherwise sophisticated characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s motivation—the need to articulate the unspoken—is clear and drives the narrative arc from isolation to connection. His interiority is distinct, though the "shy knots" constraint feels slightly archetypal for a silent artist figure. The choice to say "Use me" serves as a solid moment of agency, shifting him from a solo creator to a conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Etta’s internal conflict between her role as a servant and her scholarly nature drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct; she orchestrates the theft not for material gain but for emotional survival, and her final renunciation—choosing a method over a trophy—is a earned, character-specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s internal voice is distinct and dense with professional metaphor, but her motivation to "volunteer" to stay on a drifting, severed craft strains credibility for a professional meteorologist. The emotional landscape is rich, though the lack of visceral fear pushes the characterization toward the romantic rather than the embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal contradiction—an artist of light who cannot recognize faces—is beautifully dramatized and resolves in a profound Conceptual Repricing. The prosopagnosia is not merely a quirk but the lens for the final epiphany about "limits as frames," integrating character flaw and thematic resolution seamlessly. The choice to paint the book instead of cataloging reveals stubborn agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio’s agency drives the narrative; the transition from passive observer to active navigator is earned through the specific action of "sketching" the pattern. The interior state of "sociable isolation" provides a distinct, grounded emotional texture that anchors the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is more of a lyrical vessel than a distinct agent; their motivation ("learn the rhythm") is abstract and met with little internal resistance. The "driftwood nostalgia" feels like an imposed label rather than an embodied emotion derived from specific loss or backstory. While the locksmith performs the necessary actions, the lack of struggle or difficult choices leaves the character feeling somewhat flat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s internal contradiction—a ghost seeking relevance through bureaucracy and service—is compelling and distinct. Kerran’s agency drives the plot despite physical limitations, and the emotional arc from feeling unheard in life to being trusted in death is poignant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist serves as an effective archetypal figure for a fable, but his emotional interiority relies on stated labels ("beautifully flawed devotion," "bruised awe") rather than embodied struggle. The backstory of the child functions as a generic symbol ("ash now") rather than a specific, lived relationship, which limits the depth of the final emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's weariness and reluctance are palpable, grounding the magical elements in genuine emotional exhaustion. The internal arc from defying the blueprint to understanding its desire for recognition is a profound, well-earned shift. The parallel drawn between the caretaker's precision and the birds' mechanical nature adds depth to the character's entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara’s interiority is distinct and grounded in her profession, using polymer metaphors effectively to frame her worldview. However, her emotional arc relies heavily on expository summary ("grief finally loosened," "she stopped asking forgiveness") rather than dramatized interactions or decisions in the moment. The shift from guilt to atonement feels inevitable and linear, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses acting in a live scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vendor’s internal arc from uncertainty to finding his place as a "margin" is poignant and well-structured. However, the emotional experience is somewhat filtered through high-concept metaphors ("memories... shelved on different branches") rather than visceral, embodied reaction. While the final realization is earned, the character functions slightly more as a thematic vessel than a fully fleshed entity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rafi is a compelling focalizer whose internal landscape is tightly bound to his physical reality. The rejection of the massacre shard effectively dramatizes his agency and limits, defining his competence through a concrete micro-choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mara functions more as a thematic vehicle than a realized character, defined by explicit labels ("empathetically decisive") rather than complex internal friction. Her immediate competence and lack of doubt flatten the narrative arc, as she faces no genuine emotional cost or temptation to abandon the task.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s internal conflict—stabilizing as an engineer versus surrendering as an archivist—drives the narrative to a decisive turn. The "helix-minded" trait moves beyond a label to dictate his specific tactical solution (entangling rather than straightening) at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    The archivist is distinct and competent, defined by his "prism-minded" attribute. However, his success in the climax relies on prior training ("scorched away laziness") rather than a dynamic, on-page choice or sacrifice, resulting in a static character arc where he passes tests simply by being who he already is.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lio functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a complex character; he lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or a moment where his desire is genuinely tested. The relationship with Ina is frictionless, offering immediate cooperation rather than a dynamic crucible that forces a difficult choice. There is no emotional cost to his success beyond generic fatigue, leaving the victory unearned by character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Oren’s internal landscape is compelling, seamlessly linking his pedagogical history to the present crisis with palpable weight. The shift from seeking exoneration to accepting his role as a necessary "sacrifice" is a profound, earned character arc that feels rooted in his established identity as a tutor. His specific discipline—finding beauty in difficulty—consistently drives his perceptions and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is deep and precise; Elias’s pacifism is not just a trait but a traumatic response to his own potential for violence. The internal conflict is vivid, and the shift from avoidance to engagement with the diary feels earned by his specific worldview. The "shout" backstory provides excellent grounding for his obsession with silence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora is a distinct presence with well-rendered sensory interiority, but the "confession she had never spoken aloud" functions as a phantom thread that never pays off or complicates the present action. Her motivation is poetic but abstract; while "cultivating serenity" is a stated goal, it lacks the concrete, visceral urgency required to ground the high stakes of village survival.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lio serves as a capable vehicle for observation, but his internal life relies on summarized backstory ("memories vibrated") rather than dramatized struggle in the present. He lacks a pivotal micro-choice that tests his values or competence; he simply proceeds physically until he succeeds. The connection to his past feels inserted to explain motivation rather than emerging organically under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s competence is compellingly dramatized through the choice to prioritize sensory data over protocol ("experience said to start with the air"). The integration of the flight engineer's memory provides a grounded emotional anchor for the "foresight" motivation, deepening the stakes beyond mere professionalism. The internal voice is distinct, blending technical expertise with a weary, tactile awareness of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is competent and the internal state is vividly rendered through synesthetic perception. However, the character functions more as a ritual vessel than an individual making a difficult choice; the fear is stated ("fear that the stone might resist") rather than dramatized through a costly trade-off or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivation is deeply internalized and consistent; Cael’s shift from commanding to listening is earned through the specific ritualistic actions on page. The "boy died" backstory provides necessary weight to his grief, though the epiphany borders on explicitly stated self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s trait of borrowing personalities is not merely decorative but actively shapes the interaction, culminating in the chilling "voice now stolen from the first person who ever lied to me." The protagonist’s internal struggle between "rigid arithmetic" and the chaotic reality of empathy is dramatized effectively through the choice of the specific memory. The emotional cost—the loss of the "tidy grief" that defined the protagonist—is palpably realized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal shift from jittery to grounded is well-dramatized through physical action and interaction with the pendant. Interiority is distinct, though the sudden realization about the mentor's fate feels like an unearned intuition ("magic download") rather than a deduction derived from evidence, slightly weakening the earned nature of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is drawn with distinct, specific interiority ("responsible curiosity," "inconvenient honesty") that elevates the archetype of the town mystic. The final "truthful lies" stance is a strong character beat that recontextualizes the role, though the town's collective acceptance is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly reducing the felt cost of the relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Nari’s internal conflict is embodied in action; the decision to unweave her life’s work creates a profound, character-specific cost. Her intuition regarding the puzzle feels earned by her vocation as a spinner.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.7)
    Corren’s interiority is distinct, blending his trade with his emotional landscape ("furnace of his chest"). While his motivation is clear, the climax relies more on innate ability than a difficult, character-defining choice that forces a significant sacrifice or change in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lio’s sensory-specific interiority anchors the premise well ("diagrams of smell"), creating a distinct worldview. However, the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic summary ("withheld truth is... what we quietly refuse to witness") rather than embodied experience, slightly distancing the emotional cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias represents a superbly realized shift from passive observer to active participant, earned entirely through on-page micro-choices (rearranging stones, reading letters). His reticence acts as a perfect foil to the vulnerability required by the ending. The transition from the "shadow between their names" to the one who answers is motivated by a legible, visceral ache.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orrin is a distinct presence, defined by a specific history of "accidental prophecy" that crucially motivates the climax. The emotional texture of "shadowed elation" and his complex reaction to the hum elevate him above a mere observer. His shift from passive habit to active steering is earned by the established character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's internal motivation—learning the nature of stories—is clear, but the secondary characters lack distinct voices. The courier and the child speak in the same high-register, metaphor-dense idiom as the narrator ("secrets are migrating," "stories... feel like balloons"), creating a "ventriloquism" effect where everyone sounds like the author. This uniformity undermines the reality of the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Milo has a clear, yearning-based motivation ("discover what trees witness") that drives the narrative, but he faces minimal internal or external resistance. The emotional arc is smooth and lacks the friction of contradictory impulses or felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but she lacks the contradictory impulses or internal conflict required for higher bands. She performs her duty without hesitation, and while her hands shake, the text dramatizes no specific personal cost or difficult trade-off in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is characterized largely through labeled summary ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic") rather than dramatized action in the present. His transformation is swift and aided by a magical intervention rather than an internal struggle that forces a difficult choice; the "compassion" trait is told, not shown as a tool for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is drawn with precise interiority; his identity as a "noticer" effectively drives the conflict of witnessing versus acting. The internal struggle is consistent, though the prompt-mandated label "creeping normality noticer" feels slightly diagnostic within the otherwise lyrical voice. His resignation at the end feels earned by the specific interaction with the bread and the mistress.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Serin's transition from an "orderly" preserver to an active co-creator is a compelling arc that drives the narrative. While the "shameful" nature of his private motive is stated rather than dramatized early on, his final choice to braid his own vow into the archive is a profound act of agency that clearly defines his character.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Loretta’s internal conflict—desire for truth versus the safety of ignorance—is perfectly embodied in the "jar" metaphor and her physical hesitation ("staggered"). Her background as a moonshiner’s daughter isn't just backstory; it dictates her stealth, her negotiation style, and her interpretation of the climax (the "scrape of boots"). The renunciation of her father's mythos is earned through specific, painful causality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator's defining trait ("skeptic") is stated rather than dramatized; they accept the fantastical elements and the group's dogma without visible resistance or struggle. The internal arc resolves via a prop-induced epiphany rather than a hard-won psychological shift, making the transformation feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct presence with clear motivation, and his grief is palpably rendered. However, the climax relies on diagnostic interiority ("He realizes he has not freed himself...") rather than letting the action of the drawing convey the shift. This label-heavy realization flattens the emotional peak into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lio is a distinct focalizer whose profession and physical reaction to dishonesty effectively ground the story's high-concept premise. His motivation is clear and consistent, though his internal struggle at the threshold feels somewhat brief and resolved without deep oscillation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio is a compelling focalizer whose internal landscape—"thinking in intervals"—and physical constraint of seasonal muteness distinctively shape his choices. His decision to forego explanation in favor of immediate craft demonstrates character through action, though his high competence minimizes the sense of internal struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's "nostalgia for monsters" creates a sophisticated, paradoxical interiority that elevates the android archetype beyond standard tropes. The shift from passive caretaker to active architect of his own "burn" is decisive, and the physical embodiment of stress ("servos misfiring") grounds the character's struggle in his chassis.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose trait of "listening" anchors the narrative voice. However, she functions more as a catalyst than a protagonist under pressure; her choices are facilitative rather than costly, and she lacks the internal contradiction or conflicting impulses required for higher complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s specialized skill set (acoustic cryptography) acts as a compelling filter for interiority, grounding lyrical abstraction in concrete competence. The relationship with Ara Quinn drives motivation effectively, turning a salvage mission into a personal act of resurrection and defiance. The choice to prioritize the journals over the handlers' data feels earned by the established emotional stakes, though the "tasting me for passwords" line strains the sensory metaphor slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is highly specific and grounded in the protagonist's dual role as lantern lighter and observer of the town's decay. The motivation to understand the memory loss is clear and compelling, transitioning effectively from observation to the active ritual at the climax. The connection between the father's lore and the current crisis adds earned depth to the protagonist's competence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ilen is a competent, focused protagonist whose compassion and skill are established early. While his motivation is clear, he lacks internal contradiction or significant struggle; his success feels inevitable due to his overwhelming competence, reducing the sense of risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The relationship between the protagonist and the tutor serves as a strong crucible, driving the narrative efficiently. The pivot from theft to apprenticeship is slightly sudden but anchored well by the shared theme of "agreed upon lies." The ghost’s pedagogical patience provides a perfect foil to the protagonist’s eagerness, creating a distinct dynamic that sustains the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Neris's interior guilt regarding her brother is visceral and grounds the fantasy elements effectively, giving weight to the central choice. However, her "skeptic" trait dissolves too quickly; she accepts the Caretaker's exposition without the resistance implied by her characterization, making the middle beat feel passive.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Irian's internal conflict is compelling, anchored by the rose thorn and the memory of his mother's unfinished letter. His motivation to "unlink" the innocent grounds the high-concept premise in genuine emotion. Sevran serves primarily as a catalyst, but his turn from threat to mentor is handled with enough gravity to feel earned within the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora’s motivation—grief seeking an answer—is potent and drives the scene efficiently. Her internal landscape is vivid, though the realization at the end feels slightly more like an intellectual summary ("Grief sharpened... knot of blame untangling") than a visceral emotional event shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marek's motivation is rooted in specific backstory (the sister), and the woman's grief is physically embodied in the freezing tears. However, the protagonist's internal attribute ("weaves truth carefully") is inserted via repetitive exposition rather than demonstrated naturally in the pivotal moment. The interaction feels slightly functional, with the woman serving primarily as a vessel for the mystery rather than a fully resisting agent.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s insecurity about "useless" work provides a clear, grounded motivation that drives the interaction. Master Ren functions effectively as a mentor figure, though he leans heavily on the "sage dispensing wisdom" archetype without much individual subversion.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's arc from professional skeptic to the very thing he once debunked is executed with masterful irony. His internal landscape is specific and contradictory—distrusting seals but believing in blackmail—making the final choice to withhold the diamond feel inevitable and deeply character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ilen is a distinctly drawn protagonist, with his internal state ("gritty whimsy") coloring his perception of the world effectively (e.g., mold as pilgrims). The choice to submit to the voice is framed as an inevitability rooted in character history ("choice had probably been made years ago"), which slightly dampens active agency but fits the resignation arc. His reaction to the intrusion—moving from domestic annoyance to awe—feels grounded and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal arc—from hoarding echoes to sharing them—is beautifully dramatized through the transaction with the woman. His motivation to "translate" is clearly established and paid off, though the "madness" aspect remains a label rather than a palpable internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a competent, proactive protagonist whose expertise drives the resolution. The "logically emotional" trait acts as a functional framework for his internal process, though it leans on exposition ("categorized," "flowcharts") rather than dramatized emotional struggle. His improvisation at the climax demonstrates agency, but the internal cost of this "dangerous" adaptation feels somewhat theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the lesson rather than an agent of change; they wait and obey until the epiphany is delivered by an external source. The motivation ("cities were cracking") is abstract and distant, lacking immediate on-page pressure. The climax relies on a summary list of memories ("images rose behind my eyes") rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s professional weariness is well-drawn, and the shift from compliance to rebellion is legible. However, the supervisor’s pressure relies on expository internal monologue ("echoed in my head") rather than a dramatized past interaction or concrete present constraint, making the antagonist feel slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s internal conflict is embodied and compelling; his hesitation mirrors the broken mechanism in a way that feels character-driven rather than just convenient. Mara functions effectively as a catalyst, though she leans slightly into the "wise mentor" archetype without much independent agency beyond the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orin is a sharply drawn protagonist whose internal conflict—the "sting" of realizing his agency was an illusion engineered by the Algorithm—adds necessary depth to the "quest" archetype. His decision to proceed despite this blow to his ego ("give me your impossible arrow") earns the climax. His specific trait of "barnacle-like" curiosity anchors his motivation perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s internal landscape is vivid, defined by a compelling professional melancholia and the "stone in the shoe" motivation. The choice to protect the secret at the end ("closed the interface") is a strong character beat that respects the autonomy of the missing, shifting the protagonist from investigator to guardian. The voice remains consistent, though the connection to Ora relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized past interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ira is a competent protagonist whose specific trait (intuition over argument) drives the resolution. His internal state is well-rendered, though the pivot from "should have argued" to the mirror method feels slightly frictionless; the cost is intellectual rather than deeply visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is rendered with precision, balancing the desire for cessation against an instinctual pull toward life. The transition from the "euthanasia tourist" persona to the epiphany on the boat is driven by credible, accumulated sensory experiences rather than sudden sentiment. The "grammar breaking" detail effectively characterizes the sister's post-accident state while integrating a difficult constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tomas is a compelling archetype with a distinct worldview, but his motivation is delivered via abstract label-speak ("nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than embodied desire. The woman's emotional transition is credible, though her acceptance of the metaphor feels slightly hurried to fit the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist is a compelling functional archetype whose agency is sharply dramatized through the tactical choice to intervene in the prophecy. While the mythic distance limits deep emotional intimacy, the physical cost of his balance—reading tremors, nearly falling—effectively grounds his internal state in the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal landscape—a "subtle puzzle archivist" grappling with inadequacy—is drawn with precision and empathy. The shift from reluctance to communal engagement is earned through interaction, though the internal conflict resolves somewhat smoothly without a moment of acute resistance or high-stakes choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a deeply realized focalizer whose shift from reticent safety to courageous resistance is earned through specific sensory interaction with the crystal. The internal conflict is embodied in the "fragile hope," and the final decision to testify using the "fractured sequences" represents a decisive, high-stakes stance crystallization with clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prophet is a vivid, high-concept creation, but the narrator remains a passive observer with little interior friction or distinct desire beyond the prompt's mandate. Mara functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character, and the "we" at the end blurs individual reactions rather than sharpening the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ilias is a compelling focalizer whose "tired precision" grounds the high-concept stakes in tactile labor. His contradictory impulses—protocol versus the desperate need to "harness the ephemeral"—drive a decisive action that feels strictly character-derived. The integration of grief as a professional motivator is handled with nuance, creating a seamless bond between internal state and external crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira is empathetic and her choice to suppress the results shows agency, but the "decisively kind" trait relies on exposition and the interaction lacks the friction or cost that reveals deep character. Mr. Alvarez feels idealized, speaking in polished thematic statements ("if God is anywhere...") rather than authentic human rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is singular and compelling, driving every on-page choice. The shift from "fearful ascent" to "terrifying freedom" is earned through action, with the internal conflict between safety and curiosity dramatized effectively in the ritual's execution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s internal contradiction—a skeptic who forgives people but not the universe—drives the narrative beautifully, culminating in a choice that honors both traits. The voice is distinct, and the emotional logic of bone-setting as a form of forgiveness provides a compelling, character-specific lens for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is a noble archetype ("virtuous artisan") whose motivation is clear but static. There is no internal contradiction, temptation, or flaw to complicate the narrative; the "ache" is atmospheric rather than a driver of difficult choices. The character functions as a competent vessel for the concept rather than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's internal sense of exposure is well-rendered, but characterization relies heavily on inserted labels ("watchful dreamer," "quietly proactive") rather than demonstrated action. The emotional shift is legible but feels slightly unearned due to the lack of on-page interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is legible, but the climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("unburdened by his need to convert tenderness into metaphor," "clarity of his own cowardice") rather than purely dramatized struggle. This "therapy-speak" in peak beats softens the visceral cost of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype lacking internal contradiction, blind spots, or genuine struggle; his success is driven by competence rather than difficult choice. The "whimsical" label substitutes for character depth, and he pays no personal cost for the resolution. The absence of friction makes him a catalyst rather than a dramatic agent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is a compelling archetypal figure whose singular competence drives the narrative ritual. While his motivation is explicitly clear (keeping a promise), the absence of internal conflict or contradictory impulses limits the psychological depth, rendering him more a mythic operator than a fully realized agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority is rich and specific ("peripherally focused"), directly informing the resolution. While his motivation is clear, it relies partially on a recalled monologue from the Commissioner rather than immediate pressure, slightly distancing the stakes. The "peripheral" trait is beautifully dramatized in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to understand the angles that let pain loosen") is distinct and drives the ritualistic action. The internal conflict regarding their own erasure is successfully externalized through the magic system, and the resolution—a shift in stance rather than a removal of pain—demonstrates earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional specificity; her grief is active, not passive, driving the conflict between stasis and utility. The transition from "holding a pause" to "opening the wood" is a earned psychological shift, rooted deeply in the established "hauntingly practical" character trait. The contradiction between feeling betrayal and seeking usefulness drives the scene to a resonant choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s arc from accumulation to renunciation is deeply felt and earned on the page. Internal conflict regarding the "borrowed lives" versus the "void" drives the narrative to a decisive psychological shift. The choice to upend the pockets represents a tangible release of the character's central burden.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is a distinct focalizer with a clear worldview ("listening to structures"), but she lacks internal contradiction or grit under pressure. The reference to "Grief 101" hints at depth that remains abstract and unpaid on the page; her motivation is intellectual rather than viscerally embodied, making her feel slightly more like a thematic vehicle than a person making difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a deeply realized protagonist whose specific backstory—a failed inventor of musical clocks—and internal conflict between witnessing and fixing drive the narrative seamlessly. The connection between the clock's mechanical failure and his father's death provides a potent, embodied motivation for breaking the sanctuary's rules, elevating the stakes from professional to personal. His interiority is distinct and consistent, avoiding stock responses in favor of a unique, melancholy precision.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between "cowardly honesty" and the "hunger to understand" is compelling and drives the narrative arc. The shift from cynical salvage diver to a defiant revealer of truth is earned through the underwater discovery. The "legend seeker" aspect feels slightly tacked on via simile rather than fully embodied in agency, but the core motivation holds.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Eli is a passive observer who succeeds in his goal without struggle or internal conflict. His interaction with the woman lacks friction; she simply validates his existing beliefs, leaving his character arc flat and static.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator's interiority is distinct and melancholic, establishing a strong, specific worldview ("cartography of wounds"). Sera acts as a compelling foil, though her dialogue occasionally drifts into diagnostic self-analysis ("geography of healing") rather than subtextual interaction. The emotional connection feels earned through the shared action of walking rather than just declared.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s arc from passive resignation to active rebellion is compelling and rooted in the specific "memory of wings" established early on. The internal conflict is embodied in visceral reactions (shaking, knees going weak) rather than abstract thought, grounding the shift in character reality. His final decision to become a "custodian or fool" is a decisive, earned transformation that redefines his identity against the world's expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maris is a compelling focalizer; her motivation (replying to her father's legacy) clearly informs her compassion for the boy. The internal conflict is embodied in the final choice to give the coin, a tangible cost that grafts her story to his. The connection between the two characters feels earned rather than coincidental due to the shared thematic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira functions well as a fable archetype, and her sacrifice of "skepticism" provides a clear, thematic character arc. However, her "skepticism" feels more like a magical key than a deeply embodied psychological trait, and the trait "realistically imaginative" reads more like a prompt insertion than organic characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist is fully realized, with a motivation ("share light without using fire") that is deeply felt and historically grounded in the grandmother memory. The internal conflict—tending the external garden while being unable to prune the internal one—is palpable and drives the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias possesses a distinct, meditative interiority that fits the story's tone, particularly in his reaction to the "mistake" butterfly. However, he functions primarily as a reactive vessel for the grandmother's instructions, lacking significant agency or difficult on-page choices until the final ritual. His motivation is clearly stated but feels abstract, driving a process rather than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is vivid and central, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("turned into incremental avoidance") rather than embodied experience. This intellectual summary creates a slight emotional distance at the peak. The shift from obsession to stewardship is clear but feels somewhat rapid for the depth of the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—balancing a "blithe" facade against the weight of "unfinished intentions"—is compelling and resolves with a poignant realization of his nature. However, the "blithe" trait feels somewhat told rather than dramatized; the narrative voice is uniformly solemn and atmospheric, making the "whistling" persona feel distant from the on-page experience.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elian is a compelling, specific protagonist whose internal conflict (the burden of defining reality vs. the fear of error) drives the narrative. His expertise is dramatized well through the map-making process, and the final choice feels deeply rooted in his character traits rather than plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lina’s evolution from an accuracy-obsessed copyist to a revolutionary is a compelling internal arc that grounds the fantasy. Her decision to convert the intruder into a witness demonstrates agency and earns the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing her role as a performer with the weight of her trauma. The connection between the ritual and her history with the fire provides strong motivation, though her interiority occasionally leans on thematic summary rather than immediate emotional processing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, delivering the "rationally rebellious" persona with consistent cynical wit and "abrasive calm." However, the character remains static, functioning as an observer in an iterative loop rather than an agent making new, high-stakes choices in a specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maro's internal landscape ("ache worn thin") and the soldier backstory effectively ground his "magical teacher" archetype, avoiding a purely functional role. The students, while defined by their conflict, serve the fable structure well, and the final choice is driven by character agency rather than mere instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ariel is a compelling protagonist with specific, embodied interiority ("tasted simply of possibilities") that grounds the high-concept premise. The relationship with Kai adds warmth, and the dialogue ("Hurry is the only courtesy we owe the dead") efficiently reveals worldview. However, the use of "informally wise" as a descriptor for a sound leans on telling rather than showing, and the clinical internal monologue regarding "synaptic plasticity" briefly breaks character immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marla’s condition of involuntary truth is internalized well, functioning as both a burden and a key rather than a superpower. Her internal conflict—valuing the quiet while knowing the city must wake—creates genuine agency, though the boy functions more as a plot device than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli is a distinct, hypersensitive focalizer whose internal logic drives the narrative. His choice to move the bed toward the "altered corner" rather than retreat is a deeply character-specific resolution that earns the label "creeping normality noticer" beyond a mere prompt insertion. The integration of his professional/personal obsession with the house's behavior is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and their internal burden is well-rendered, anchoring the story effectively. However, the visitor feels functionally compliant, serving primarily as a prompt for the statue's philosophy rather than offering genuine resistance or distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arin is a clearly defined, cerebral protagonist whose internal conflict—intellectual optimism versus the reality of infinite confinement—is compelling. The shift from seeking a theoretical "texture of missed opportunity" to accepting the "grain of the present" acts as a strong, earned emotional arc. The trait "grim optimist" is demonstrated through action, though the specific phrasing of the required attribute "balancedly daring" reads as a slightly awkward expository label rather than an embodied characteristic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aurelia functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized protagonist. While her motivation (proving kindness) is clear, she faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine obstacles within the scene. Her success is immediate and unopposed, lacking the psychological friction or difficult choices required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator's shift from a detached "visiting guide" to a committed participant is clear, though the transformation happens rapidly given the short length. Lira is a vivid, if slightly stylized, foil who effectively challenges the protagonist's worldview. The internal motivation ("private mission to rescue dying arts") is consistent and pays off in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aurek is a distinct protagonist whose trade (counter-clockwise clocks) thematically integrates with the plot’s resolution. While his motivation ("step beyond fate") is clear, the emotional stakes feel slightly abstract, relying on told phrases like "tired ache in his own marrow" rather than dramatized interpersonal or internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s internal landscape of survivor’s guilt is vividly realized, grounding the surreal premise in a specific emotional reality. The shift from fearing death to fearing "being seen continuing" provides a potent, character-driven turn that earns the resolution. The "whispering advisor" functions effectively as an externalized drive, though it teeters on being a device rather than a fully distinct persona.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aera is a competent, distinct focalizer whose internal landscape of ancestral memory and present fear grounds the fantastical elements. Her expertise is established well through specific actions ("interpreted cloud movements," "polished smooth by generations"), though her "old fear" feels slightly more stated than dramatized given her absolute competence during the crisis. The interplay between her internal state and the physical demands of the orchard is strong, but the lack of a falter or mistake lowers the complexity of the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Keth’s motivation is compelling, rooted in a "quietly driven" guilt that naturally escalates into defiance when the Council refuses to act. His internal conflict between fear and duty is resolved through a coherent, character-specific decision to communicate directly with the turtles. The shift from "not yet brave enough" to unilateral action is earned by the immediate pressure of the cracking shells.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is a distinct, compelling professional whose historian worldview effectively colors his perception ("annotated by time"). The "emotionally rational" trait works well as a behavioral constraint, though its repetitive labeling tells rather than shows in the second instance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s dual nature—official surveyor versus secret witness—creates a compelling, contradictory interiority that drives the scene. Her choice to use professional skills for a private, poetic act is earned by established backstory and grounded in the immediate scene. The cost of her isolation and the finite nature of her resources (ink, time) is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation ("trace honest origins") that drives the narrative. However, the characterization relies on direct labeling ("tranquilly perceptive," "logical") rather than purely enacting these traits through pressure, and the emotional cost of the discovery remains intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s internal landscape is rich, grounding the fantastical profession in the specific, heavy grief for her daughter. The struggle is well-embodied in the physical ritual of the tea and tools, though the phrase "turn ache into architecture" reads as a slightly explicit thematic label within her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s transformation from a hunter of abstract futures to a protector of specific ghosts is deeply earned. The internal conflict—seeking control to mitigate trauma—resolves beautifully when the "unused potential" is recognized not as a threat, but as lost kin.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is a legible focalizer with a clear backstory, but her internal arc is linear and lacks active struggle on the page. The transition from trauma to healing feels unearned because there is no contradictory impulse or moment of resistance; she seeks an answer and receives it without navigating a difficult character-based choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s profession and internal conflict are compelling, and the motivation to uncover the past drives the narrative. However, the interiority relies heavily on metaphorical summary ("guilt I have finally decided to name") rather than embodied resistance or struggle, making the emotional arc feel slightly composed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's motivation—redeeming a past failure that killed his father—is clearly dramatized and forces a painful, high-stakes choice at the climax. While the specific trait "uncommonly thoughtful" is expository and leads to some diagnostic interiority, the final decision to sacrifice the brother effectively reveals character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist’s identity as a “broken navigator” is rigorously integrated into interiority, motivation, and action. The internal conflict—between the urge to vanish and the need to be forgiven—is dramatized effectively through the physical struggle with the kayak and compass. The shift from “wanting to vanish” to “paddling toward them” is earned by the specific interaction with the environment, not just abstract thought.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    The internal duality between the "clean" narrator and the "dirty" past self is dramatized with exceptional nuance ("stranger practicing expressions"). The choice to trust the pre-cleanse self feels earned by the specific, visceral dissatisfaction with the sanitized present. The protagonist’s agency drives the descent, culminating in a choice that accepts pain over numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Internal conflict is expertly managed; the protagonist's reluctance to pay the "unspoken price" (the animals' lives and his own humanity) creates genuine friction against his desire. The choice to proceed is earned by the depth of grief, and the transformation is a logical extension of his character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist with a clear motivation. The specific memory of the tablecloth adds excellent grounding to his internal state. However, the emotional climax relies heavily on summarized internal realization ("He understood then") rather than dramatized struggle or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist is a well-rendered "echo," and the gravitational response to emotion is a brilliant, specific characterizing trait that physicalizes internal states. However, the character's journey is largely narrated through summary and habitual action rather than dramatized choice in the present moment, which distances the reader from the "vow" to remain pacifist.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Niko is a compelling protagonist with a distinct, paradoxical identity ("destitute philanthropist") and a unique motivation ("texture of transformation"). His internal conflict regarding prophecy is well-dramatized, though the secondary character, Lila, functions primarily as an expository device to deliver the myth. The "accidental prophecy" trait creates a strong, unified drive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iri is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal state matches her external actions perfectly. Her "calmly inventive" nature is dramatized through her preparation of the copper rods and her handling of the sundial. The interaction with Trann effectively displays status dynamics and code-switching without heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's precognitive curse is integrated seamlessly into the narrative drive, creating a unique constraint that defines his movement and choices. The climax hinges on a visible, embodied micro-choice (slipping vs. kneeling) where his contradictory impulses of fear and duty play out in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The poet’s motivation—to understand his erasure—is compelling and clearly dramatized through the "old absence." However, the dialogue feels staged and overly aphoristic ("commanded like weather"), which creates a distance that prevents full emotional immersion in the relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Darius is a compelling, highly specific figure with a strong voice, but his agency is largely contemplative until the final moments. The lack of immediate interpersonal pressure for most of the narrative leaves his internal conflict feeling somewhat theoretical ("fencing against inertia") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's "molting" trait transcends mere labeling by functioning as the decisive tactic during the climax, allowing them to survive the patrol. The relationship with Lio provides a necessary grounding counterweight, and the internal contradiction between the "vagrant" nature and the desire to build something lasting is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and drives the narrative arc effectively. However, the dialogue often drifts into "theme-speak," where characters articulate their internal states and the story's thesis with implausible precision (e.g., "This place is for people who choose not to choose"), reducing emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s internal conflict—guarding safety versus admitting a painful truth—is clearly dramatized and anchors the narrative. The burden of the "curse and blessing" is felt in his physical actions and hesitation. The shift from protector of myth to witness of history is a well-earned internal pivot, though the council serves more as a collective pressure plate than a distinct relational antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by his regret and profession ("pruning silence"), creating a consistent internal voice. However, his agency is low; he follows a compass and finds an object that unlocks his emotion, rather than earning the realization through active struggle or difficult choice. The reliance on retrospective summary ("He had spoken harshly") rather than dramatized memory distances the reader from the core relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong interiority and motivation rooted in time-obsession compel the final step with contradictory impulses (heart's warning vs. reverie), embodied in clutching the halo and fraying outline; minor abstraction in epiphanies like "texture of time" slightly unearned but does not touch closure choice.

    Corin's shift from targeting lenses to vessels for inquiry shows contradictory impulses acting in scene via hands-on crafting and narration; narrator's final heart shift is earned by escalating engagement.

    Statue's motivation to fracture certainties drives pivotal consent and collapse with embodied contradiction (stone hand shifts, nerves echo); visitor's incisively kind gaze/thoughts force nuance over accusation, earning final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority via embodied ache in marrow and contradictory fear/resolve yielding at stone; micro-choices like rotating shard reveal values under pressure.

    Mira's drone pilot traits drive concrete micro-choices like projecting the schematic and mapping tones to stars, earning her realization; Leto applies relational pressure without stereotypes.

    Interiority concrete and particular, with contradictory impulses (surrender vs. paddle back) acting in the turning beat; final renunciation earned by prior compass alignment failure and barnacle observation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses between clean-slate desire and dirty-past protection act in scene via torch use and wading choice; final empathy-kindling renunciation earned by trail-following causality with embodied throat-tightening cost.

    Leon’s contradictory impulses—hovering in longing vs. striking the next chord—act simultaneously in the arbor reunion, earning the final invitation with visible cost of foreclosed hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—mourning catastrophe yet craving quiet science—is vividly embodied in her tactile setup of dust-traps. Her “kindled humility” is shown, not told, through micro-choices (taping leaks imperfectly, smelling iodine, refusing drama). The final refusal to seal the greenhouse perfectly crystallizes her renunciation with on-page cost: she surrenders dryness for memory, a visible trade-off that earns her stance. Minor dip: Amir functions mostly as sounding board, so relationship-as-crucible pressure stays light.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Luminous-glass identity is shown more than told; interiority is sensuous and specific. The slow, glass-cool pacing mirrors the narrator’s adaptive stance, but micro-choices are mostly passive observations until the final walk. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; survival guilt and creative loss are asserted, not dramatized. Closure cost is present yet feels conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lio’s wrecked-yet-inventive stance is concrete: his “numb fingers” on cold forks, the flashbulb memory of composing in the now-silent conservatory. Interior contradiction pulses—awe at the silent city against survivor guilt—but micro-choices (“He triggered… Wonder 3”) advance him to civic-scale action. Motivation intensifies from private grief to public mission without epiphany-speak; the cost is visceral in “his ribs felt it.” Missing is a second character or status clash to pressure values; alone, he’s compelling but not fully forged in crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s bone-deep fatigue and “inadvertently stubborn” sense of duty are viscerally anchored to his occupation; every micro-choice—rowing out alone, cradling the lens—grows from that exhaust-as-duty contradiction. The final acceptance of the librarian’s task is credible because his whole arc shows him choosing responsibility over self-preservation. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the body (weary grip, dense chest) stays present. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; flaw and value hierarchy are legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting transparency yet protecting the covenant—drives every beat; her micro-choice to ring the bell rather than expose names crystallizes hierarchy of values. Kito’s embodied fear (sagging box, rice crumbs) and his line “Sleep is for people who are not hungry” compress an entire adolescent biography. The bell’s reappearance as a non-verbal covenant, not exposé, shows earned change with visible cost: the community will keep living the secrecy she once wanted to unravel. Minor slack: Kito’s motivation is stated more than dramatized before the ridge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arun’s interiority is consistently concrete—camera, river-lung ache, monk parcel—so feelings stay embodied. Contradictory pulls (fear of burning vs need to release love) ride the same breath, never abstracted into therapy labels. The final micro-choice—approaching the boy and exhaling a lantern—pays off prior causality, foreclosing isolation with visible cost: a literal spark leaves his chest. Only the teenager’s flat diction keeps it from 9.0; we never hear the kid’s idiom to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the narrator’s trembling, sensory saturation, and obsessive attention to footprints and sap-shoes make the “texture of time” personal. Contradictory impulses—reverie vs. warning drum of the heart—co-exist in the final stride onto the bridge, so the moment feels psychologically real. No secondary character on page, so status and relational bullets N/A. The renunciation/dissolution is foreshadowed by earlier root-clasps and photo-burns, so the cost feels earned rather than abstract. Voice slips once into diagnostic-speak (“hyperbolic geometry”) but recovers immediately through sensory offset, so only a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is sharp—her “chains as price for time” choice is embodied and contradictory. The Overseer stays a blunt status-prop; no secondary pressure from guards. Final micro-choice—guiding his hands away from ruin—earns its stasis, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the chained liberator flaw/competence balance feels individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s synesthetic, guilt-driven obsession is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (rewiring prototypes, feeding absences) flows from the wound of self-betrayal. Interior contradiction is alive: the need to “stop” trust-breaking collides with the knowledge that he caused his own. The final renunciation—no device can rewind his silence—carries visible cost under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s compulsion to “borrow” faces is anchored in concrete, embodied beats (finger on shutter, jar trembling with breath). Interior contradictions—superstition vs. hunger for destiny—play out in real time as the stranger forces the jar opening. The final recognition that the stolen gazes are now “burning reflections” inside the jar lands as earned renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (angle the lens, twist the lid) reveal a hierarchy of values: light > ethics > self; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Corin’s contradictory impulses—ex-targeting-lens craftsman now forging vessels for “unfinished thoughts”—are dramatized in the kiln gesture; the narrator’s micro-choice to accept the invitation crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete, embodied in frost-numbed fingers and thawing ribs, never sliding into label-speak. The final cost is felt: returning will mean stepping into “a question that warms itself,” foreclosing the safety of detachment. The single on-page relationship (visitor/glassblower) functions as crucible, status shift legible in the sideways “crown” placement and the deferred apology.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stunt-double’s terror is lived-in: her breath kinks, her hands won’t steady, she names each fear like a wound she’s memorized. The child’s cipher-cast gives her a micro-choice—write TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS—that externalizes the contradiction between flight and fight. Interiority toggles between visceral symptom and reflective map without slipping into therapy-speak. The ending stance is earned: she weaponizes trembling itself, a renunciation of studio invincibility that costs her borrowed identity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oracle’s quiet-mapping obsession is dramatized through tactile beats—gold flakes on fingers, palm-pressed booklet—so her interior contradiction (duty vs. dread of voiceless dark) lives in gesture, not label. The captain’s etched face and shadow-counting habit crystallize a man converting fear into inventory, giving the relationship a status tilt that flips when he accepts her silent chart. Micro-choices (opening the booklet under leaking rain, lifting the finished map toward blackness) cost them the last visual tether, so the renunciation feels earned. Only the captain’s late emotional ventriloquism (“What will your map show us…”) drifts into explanatory speech, keeping the score just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The robot’s curiosity-as-ache is a sharp, embodied contradiction that drives every looped choice; the aerial ghost-view that accrues is a credible, costly transformation of perception. Interiority stays concrete (“cool ache under every diagnostic report”) and avoids label-speak. The refusal / varied touch experiments show micro-choices under pressure, but the final stance—“thoughts come from the space between moments”—is declared, not dramatized with visible cost, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The registrar’s solitude, notebook fetish, and eventual wordless outreach are sharply particular; her contradictory need for both secrecy and connection is embodied in the micro-choice to offer the lens. The final silent pact is earned because the doodles and archive acts dramatize her flattening. Cost is felt: the rain-soaked tickets become a fragile bridge she must publicly defend. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, ink, glass, and mist externalize her stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s withered-body-as-landscape is sustained through tactile micro-choices (tasting soil, knuckles knotting into bark). His pragmatic streak turns the prognosis into on-page action—pruning, polishing, planting—so the “wise” tag earns its keep. Interior contradiction is light; we’re told he’s pragmatic rather than shown him doubting the ritual he invents. Still, the final image of him rolling a marble to “test” luck crystallizes a credibly earned stance with visible cost: his own woodening.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.7)
    Ilen’s obliging trait is asserted, not dramatized; he never refuses but we see no prior cost. The “icy warmth” is repeated yet never embodied in a micro-choice that hurts. Interiority lapses into labels—“he felt heroic”—instead of contradictory impulse under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The musician’s trespass-for-music motive stays vivid; his embodied humming of the blot-notes shows a micro-choice that risks discovery. Yet the interior contradiction—why stay once the water threatens his instrument?—isn’t dramatized; the bow at the end feels symbolic, not costly. Still, the single-POV interiority is atmospheric and consistent, avoiding diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory need to exhume yet fear the swallowed truth is dramatized in her pacing, splintered palms, and final whispered acceptance; the oracle’s refusal to forget externalizes her own fault-tolerance flaw. Cost is visceral in the swallowed weight settling “low in her chest.” Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-labeling. Minor: we never see her act on the revelation, only accept its burden—slightly lowers agency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and particular—the “religiously skeptical” lens colors every observation, while Evan’s slumped recognition at the beaded valve wheel embodies his guilt without exposition. The swallowed-truth motive drives every beat, culminating in the micro-choice to catalogue names instead of pray, a credible, costly shift. Minor slippage: Evan’s radio-listening backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so his final leap to “this is their route” feels half-earned. Still, the pair’s status dynamic—accuser/accused turned reluctant witnesses—crystallizes under pressure, satisfying the relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    Interiority is lush and character-specific; the keeper’s “grip reality loosely” mantra is dramatized through his willingness to let the room reshape around him. The final step onto blank pages is a credible renunciation of neutrality, but the interior contradiction leading to it is stated more than enacted—no moment where judgment almost slips out. Micro-choices under pressure are present yet muffled by lyric summary. Still, the embodiment of centuries of quiet observation feels lived-in and singular.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—her remembered grief and her live-duty tenderness—co-exist in-scene: guitar notes descend to reassure Mr. Alvarez while she internally flinches from the baby-curl memory. Every micro-choice (tuning before sunrise, refusing to drown the sky, letting the chord die) is driven by the “ordinary magic” credo until the eclipse itself re-prices that credo, turning memory from lance to opening. No stock therapy-speak; body cues (“grip the guitar neck,” “exhale”) carry cost. The cap is 8.9 rather than 9+ because the daughter’s death is named only via object, never given prior causal footprint that would make the final reweighting fully inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Brann's alien-historian identity is vividly embodied—cloth-wrapped boots, conductive palms—yet his interiority stays abstract ("simple and strange, even to himself"). No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the sole micro-choice is to keep descending to the next fireplace, a repetition not escalation. The cost is conceptual, not personal, so the arc plateaus rather than deepens. Still, the non-human stance is sustained without anthropizing slips.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s double-life as fortune-cookie oracle and clandestine decoder is vivid and contradictory—moonlight “as fate” versus wiping glasses. Interiority stays concrete (“I realized then my tiny scripts could transpose…”) and the final micro-choice—climbing the tower, rewriting the beam—pays off prior passivity with visible cost. The accidental-prophetic trait drives every beat; no stock self-analysis. Secondary pressure from Parker is light but sufficient to force crystallized complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Father Jonas’s quiet, music-as-exorcism vocation is vivid; his interiority—“I am not here to drag you out, but to ask why you walked in”—shows a hierarchy of values that costs him authority. The girl remains a prop, never granted a micro-choice or contradiction, so the relational crucible is one-sided. Still, his embodied micro-gesture—ultramarine on both brows—earns the earned stasis that ends the possession. Flaw: secondary character is pure vessel, flattening status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—yearning to orchestrate unseen symphonies while chronically homesick for futures he can’t inhabit—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices: mapping timelines on glass, aligning nautilus to horizon, writing fortunes that externalize his own need for order. Interiority is character-specific, never diagnostically abstract. The Earned Stasis closure—accepting exhaustion as the price of agency—pays off every prior beat; the cost is the sleepless body at dawn, baton raised over a city that will never know him.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio’s levitation as an embodied metaphor for dissociation from his own branching lives is vivid; the micro-choice to step “sideways” rather than up/down crystallizes his values. Interiority stays sensory—“gravity returned in increments”—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of the tablet carries visible cost (loss of map, return to gravity), earned by the corridor walk-through. Flaw: the other selves are glimpsed only as tableaux; we never feel one branch resist or tempt him, so the crucible never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eira’s interior contradiction—teaching hearing children while deaf—grounds every beat; her embodied memories of “pounding desks” reveal genuine struggle. Micro-choice to thread the filament is visible, forecloses her old pedagogy, and costs her control. Student Jorin’s stuttered laugh-sob is the earned change; Eira’s own tears remain off-page, so renunciation cost is felt but not scaled to her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s compulsive perimeter-check and refusal to open the tube before a full sweep crystallize “meticulous” into visible micro-choices; the final decision to stay and witness is an earned renunciation that costs him the safety of anonymity. Interiority is vividly particular—storms preferred “on paper, not in sky”—and his flaw (obsessive solitude) directly enables the closing alignment. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the score stays just below the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s fear of smell and his micro-choice to switch on Aron’s lamp are specific and embodied; the tears he finally sheds feel earned. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted emergency room disinfectant beneath phantom greenhouse humidity”). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair. Still, the refusal to turn away lands as credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid (“texture of my days”), but the narrator’s contradictory impulses stay verbal; no micro-choice dramatizes the tug between safe job and expansion. The poet’s “ethically playful” trait is shown only in reported backstory, not in-scene action. Closure choice is implied, not embodied—no on-page forfeiture—so the cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elio’s interiority is textured—sound as a second heartbeat, the bow that stalls before cadence—yet the decisive shift from “playing for coins” to “listening bowl” feels lightly motivated; the causal bridge between Mara’s invitation and his renunciation is more lyrical than dramatized, so the cost is felt but not fully earned under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eve’s interior contradiction—needing clarity yet craving empathy—drives every beat; the static-sense is embodied in “crackling halos” and copper tang, not labeled. Her micro-choice to accept the blotter-petal reconfigures her professional identity with visible cost: “you may not like the person who walks back out.” Dealer’s affectionate detachment and copper-wired wrists make him a believable catalyst, not a cipher. No stock therapy-speak; even “calibrated empathy” is immediately re-defined as counterfeit that glows, keeping diagnostic language at arm’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—profit-minded broker yearning to “uplink silent contributors”—is dramatized in the moment he offers the envelope; the cost is the visible risk to his hard-nosed reputation. Marin’s “whimsically attentive” trait is more than label: it drives her reshelving duet with Elias and seeds the later reading scheme. Relationship under pressure emerges when she tests his motives (“What did the letter lose…?”), forcing him to articulate a new value system. The final choice—fund the workers’ readings—forecloses his old, purely mercantile path with felt social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elian’s contradictory impulses—solitary artist vs. hunger for community—are dramatized in the moment he touches the obsidian and feels “the orchard’s slow heartbeat.” The final micro-choice to invite strangers into a shared weave is earned by this tactile beat and carries visible cost: he surrenders sole authorship. Interiority stays concrete (“hands permanently greened,” “luminescent ache”) without diagnostic speak. secondary characters apply only light pressure; Mira functions more as echo than crucible, capping the score just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The illustrator’s interior contradiction—draw to capture vs. refuse to cage—drives every beat; the final renunciation (“brought back drawings, not chains”) is embodied, costly, and fully earned. Micro-choices under pendant-heat (sketching absence, knotting time) reveal a values hierarchy that scales to the cosmic premise. The keeper’s brief presence supplies secondary pressure without clutter. Voice stays crisp, never drifts into diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Corren’s interiority—quiet, mathematic, grief-numbed—rings true in every beat; his shift from retrieval to acceptance is embodied in the tremor that stalls his fingers and the final pocketing of the glass eyes. The brother-shaped absence is kept alive by micro-choices: tracing the mosaic, murmuring ratios, refusing to rip the future-branch. No stock epiphanies—only a measured renunciation that costs him the fantasy of reunion. The Listener of Echoes earns his name through listening, not resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marrow’s “kindly methodical” nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices (winding tape, palming joists) and his ache to be “visible” drives every beat; the final silent intervention shows credible endurance with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. One minor slip: the librarians’ biographies are delivered in quick summary capsules rather than dramatized need, muting secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s need for control and her envy of the linden’s unthinking resilience are vividly embodied in her tactile routines and detours; the final collapse into the mud is an earned, visible cost. Interior contradiction—“circuitously sincere” rationalizations versus the shy orbit she cannot admit—drives every beat. The only bar to 9.0 is that the climactic surrender is narrated more than dramatized; we are told the green hush “pressed” rather than seeing a micro-choice that concretely releases control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s insomnia, painter’s eye, and need to wring meaning from detritus are concrete and embodied; the amber pocketing and decision to trade it crystallize her hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids label-speak—“sleep had been a rumor” is character-particular. The brooch’s weight recasting the day is a palpable micro-choice. Flaw: we don’t see her genuinely stumble; the guard’s nod feels slightly convenient, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Both women register as distinct consciousnesses: Lyra’s brittle pride in foresight shatters in real time, Mira’s quiet yearning for “small miracles” drives the final transfer. The moment Lyra bows and yields the pearl crystallizes a credible shift from seer to witness, paid for by her public loss of authority. Interiority stays concrete—“vision… crack like thin ice”—and avoids label-speak. Only the absence of a deeper flaw or contradiction keeps this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s collector-archivist identity is vivid and embodied—salt sleeves, labeled satchel, walking “staggered intervals” as ritual. Her interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the moment she pockets the valve, the chill on her wrist shows internal contradiction between duty and fear of false hope. Caven’s step-forward is credible because his exile was dramatized earlier; the throat-scar detail pays off when the first tentative note is thin. Cost is present but slight: the city’s absences “begin to navigate themselves,” a conceptual rather than viscerally felt price, keeping the renunciation just shy of full 8-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marek’s “analytically artistic” mind is dramatized in every beat: he maps grocery lists, annotates cracks, pockets the punch, then dares the doorway. The interior contradiction—rational cartographer seduced by the impossible—remains embodied, not labeled. His final choice is earned: curiosity has already cost him sleep and safety; stepping into the station is the inevitable, visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s “sympathetic skeptic” identity is lived-in: every beat of wonder is matched by a micro-choice to test, sniff, or interrogate. Contradictory impulses—wanting the tile to be ordinary yet staying to transcribe—coexist in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of flight into wonder is earned by the night-long interrogation that precedes it, and the cost (permeable self-boundary) is felt in the closing image of the filled notebook and dim tile.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is hypnotically specific—“walls are at best polite suggestions,” “endless hallway”—and the contradiction between immortal fatigue and curiosity is dramatized, not declared. Micro-choices (loosening escondite anchors) flow from established motive. The final renunciation carries conceptual cost, yet the amulet’s push feels slightly external; still, the arc lands as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sharp and embodied (“his chest is open… a quiet red cavern”), with contradictory impulses held in scene. The final micro-choice—splitting the ledger—grows credibly from the narrator’s lifelong role as the honest holder of coats. No stock labels; moral arithmetic stays character-bound. Cost is felt in the closing image of “living imbalance,” capping the arc with earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurelio’s interiority is precise—his mistrust of extravagance, the tactile memory of gilding edges, the way he “learns to refract the quiet” through lamp-hum—yet the final renunciation (writing only non-existent dates/names) arrives with full emotional cost, earned by the accreted micro-choices. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the contradiction is only asserted (“senses without admitting”). Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: archival order > personal escape, and the price—perpetual exile in invented pasts—lands as charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—his decision to “let the stories soak into him” instead of writing them down is a micro-choice that costs him any hope of recovering his own name. Flaws (passivity, voyeurism, complicity in erasure) compound across beats and crystallize in the Earned Stasis of the blank death certificate. The contradiction between needing memories and refusing fixed identity plays out in tactile gestures: clutching a rusted ladder, tracing poison letters until they blur. No stock phrasing, no therapeutic self-labeling; every thought is filtered through diesel, salt, and steel.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tamsin’s interior contradiction—myth-buster who needs myth—is vivid from the first line; her micro-choices (lifting shell, touching cello) visibly tilt her stance. The cello-shell resonance lets her hear past cruelty and rephrase it, so the renunciation of final certainty is earned with a felt intellectual cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; solo arc still satisfies. Voice stays consistent, flaw (intellectual arrogance) complicates the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Jae’s split loyalties are dramatized through the burning stone chip and covert night meetings; the embodied cue keeps interior conflict alive. Micro-choices—handing Lilo parcel data, sweating under Council questions—show cost. Final paralysis is credible, but the emotional fallout is stated (“I wondered”) rather than tasted; we’re told the cost more than we feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilya’s curiosity is concrete—he pockets vials, kneels to leave his own print, chooses not to lie—each micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values (heritage vs. duty) with visible cost. The amber flash promised to his daughter externalizes internal stakes, making the emotional price legible. The red vial’s untouched chill in the final line is Earned Stasis: refusal forecloses retreat, sealing cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s blindness is never used as gimmick; every tactile micro-choice (tracing cracks, calibrating wing tension) externalizes his need to “decode feedback into direction.” The final release of the drone crystallizes his quiet renunciation of sighted certainty—cost is felt in the empty space above the basin. Clara functions as pressure valve rather than crucible, so relationship beat is thin, capping score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartographer’s interior contradiction—precision versus the lure of a rogue, self-authored command—drives every beat; embodied unease (“familiar, subtly confident twitch”) undercuts diagnostic self-talk. Micro-choices (packing red pencil, stepping onto ice) tie professional identity to existential wager, and the final kneel to sketch is a costly refusal of bureaucratic safety. Flaws complicate rather than decorate: obedience to an unremembered note is a gamble with no safety net. The earned, visible cost is the moment the red line splits the blank shore; no epilogue is required to feel the career he is about to torch.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ansel’s solitary, obsessive precision is vivid—his soot-dark hands, the patient heel-toe walks, the private smile when the rusted bell answers. Interior contradiction is implied rather than dramatized: we’re told he stayed “because his craft had never been about work, but about weight and answer,” yet no moment shows him tempted to quit or admit doubt. The micro-choice to reverse his path and match the same tempo is concrete and character-specific, earning the town’s first shiver. Cost is present but soft: infinite patience is asserted, not tested to a visible limit.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and particular—"Silence in the deep is different; it feels like weight on the ribs"—and the micro-choice to launch the drone despite absent surface command crystallizes a lonely, self-destructive loyalty. The vial’s inhalation of private scent-memories literalizes a believable psychological cost: surrender of personal past to alien archive. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the story still earns a resonant renunciation by letting the vial consume him. Voice stays coherent and flawed—"I overrode every caution by overriding instinct"—without therapeutic self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—need to vindicate father vs. instinct to exploit the tower’s lie-friendly ecology—are enacted in concrete micro-choices (pressing ear to stone, nightly lattice watch, deciding to enter the rust-door). Interiority stays embodied (“cold numbs my jaw”). The final stance—refusal to flee before bodies are found—costs him future safety and is earned by prior causal chain. Flaws: no second on-page character, so status/relationship crucible unused; knowledge of “library of unfinished paths” arrives in a single rush rather than stepped discovery, slightly blunting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The apprentice’s interior contradiction—yearning to belong yet fearing the ghost’s claim—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (tasting the bead, pressing it to lips). The final vow feels earned because earlier tactile memories root it; still, the ghost’s motives remain slightly opaque, muting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orren’s interiority is richly embodied—“fingers calloused by rope and salt, mind stitched with lines of verse”—and every micro-choice (coiling net, aligning plate corners, altering the storm carving) externalizes his hierarchy of values. The contradiction between ruin-forgetting townsfolk and his own need to “lay new story” is kept alive in each stroke of the awl, so the final palm-press on the renewed harbor feels like the inevitable cost of his flaw: caring more for memory than for self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Leila’s contradictory impulses—scholarly detachment vs. yearning for belief—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing names, brushing dirt). The final renunciation of departure is visible in her “breathing as if for the first time,” but because that beat is slightly abstract we do not feel a hard cost foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and particular—Neve’s “second, slower heartbeat” under their ribs embodies the stakes. The chalk-code marginalia externalizes a layered internal contradiction: bureaucrat vs. child-survivor. The final micro-choice—still holding the envelope on the slot—earns credible Earned Stasis: forgiveness delayed is cost paid. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; flaw (inventing selves) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s needle-prick blood-drop, the flame-bent lie-detector beat, and her refusal to crown the prince with a story all crystallize a believable, contradictory interior. The “miscounted” star-maps as smuggling ciphers give profession immediate tactical bite. Only minor slack: the prince’s fever feels labelled, not embodied, and his uncle-fall motive is off-page cue. Still, her micro-choices visibly foreclose paths with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lysa’s interior contradiction—professional detachment colliding with private grief—surfaces in the skiff, embodied in her fierce yet careful grip on the shard. The brother’s final micro-choice (pride clamping tongue) is dramatized inside her vision, not summarized, so motivation ramifies. Cost is visible: she returns without absolution, only a “fragile map,” and the stone’s quietened pulse signals the transfer of burden. The only hairline slip is the abstract “arrogance of thinking pain could be tidily translated,” a minor therapy-speak shimmer in an otherwise concrete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory duties—translator vs reluctant confessor—are alive in every beat; her decision to lie about the illegible line is a micro-choice that costs her moral neutrality and forecloses her remove from the war. The boy’s shrewd innocence and the mother’s silent hand-off press Mara into a stance she cannot exit; the coral in her pocket is the visible price. Interiority stays embodied (“my lifeline”) and avoids label-speak. Only the surgeon’s off-stage “time” mutter keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lio’s contradictory impulses—yearning to vanish yet compelled to restore communal joy—surface in the single present-tense beat of mounting the projectors; the final renunciation of protest for quiet gifting is earned by the prior city ban and his own exile, costing him permanence. Interiority stays concrete (“laugh caught between pensive mirth and relief”), never drifting into label-speak. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; micro-choice hierarchy is visible when he opts for light over pigment. Flaw: we never feel the mistake or genuine struggle—setup to payoff is almost too smooth, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s contradictory desire to “know less” is embodied in every scrape of soot; the hobo nickel micro-choices (pocket → palm → held to reflected sound) externalize the interior contradiction. Emotions are sensorily grounded (“heartbeat keeping time with the quiet shiver”). The final renunciation of the restoration plan is earned by the garden’s audible questioning and the mural’s visible hand-lift. No second character, so relationship/status bullets N/A; interiority alone carries the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arlen’s ironic, archivist-smuggler voice is vivid, but his interior contradiction—why risk so much for a garden graffito—never sharpens into a single on-page micro-choice that costs him. The entomologist’s pivot supplies the only visible beat of pressure, not his own stakes. A stronger visceral crunch (tax audit fear, seed-packet forgery slip) would earn the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet’s insomnia, need to transmute pain into beauty, and memory of his grandmother supply clear, embodied motives that escalate to the public song. Internal contradiction is thin—no moment where he almost turns back—and the “shyly unstoppable” trait is asserted, not probed under pressure, but his visible resolution to accept the moon’s phases earns a credible micro-change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s “gently systematic” ritualism is embodied in every micro-gesture; the moment he chooses to inhale the song and exhale a new orchid, his life’s premise is overturned at visible cost—he forfeits the safety of neutrality. Interior contradiction pulses: duty to archive sounds vs. ache for the unarchived. No stock introspection; thoughts ride breath and glass. The renunciation lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s cowardice-driven silence and the embodied cost of the Arithene vow (can’t speak half-truths) create a credible, high-stakes interior arc; micro-choices—inking each promise, throat texture shifting—are specific and charged. The single-scene crucible keeps motives lean and legible. No second character on the page, so relationship/status bullets are rightly absent; the self-vs-self conflict is sufficient. Closure is earned: the lattice locks honesty in place, foreclosing retreat with a felt physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    Arlen’s interiority is present but leans on abstract moral accounting (“encrypted compassion”) rather than embodied contradiction; the tremble is visible yet not tied to a specific micro-choice that costs him on the page. Councilors remain types whose speech is filtered through Arlen’s summary, so status pressure stays theoretical. The arc lands as a credible renunciation, but the emotional price is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Noel’s contradictory need to erase and resurrect his musical past is dramatized in concrete beats: selling the turntable for the meteorite, tying melody-bars to birds, finally writing the forbidden song. Interiority is specific—dust as “slow trumpet,” guilt as attic balance—never abstract. The final act of releasing the bird with the completed song is earned; it costs him the last relic of his erased identity. Yet the woman’s pressure is mostly declarative; her presence supplies the pivot but not a fully reciprocal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is vivid—“peeling myself out like a husk” embodies the surreal transit—but the father’s leap into self-erasure is stated more than dramatized, so the daughter’s final renunciation, while moving, feels lightly causally anchored. The contradiction between needing to cross and refusing to cross is present in the silent strip of soil, giving a credible Earned Stasis. Micro-choices (daily chair-shifts) track obsession, but only one carries visible cost (the room tilts). Emotional calibration is convincing; no therapy-speak, yet the father’s cosmic rule-set is asserted, not mined for internal contradiction. Still, the arc of obsessive decoding → discovery → sacrificial standstill lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s quiet ache to “learn the rhythm of belonging” is embodied in micro-choices—tracing patterns with the burnt feather, asking Mira to dim the lights—so the renunciation of fixed charts feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: the feather smells of leaving, the chest knot loosens when shrimp write “wild script” on the glass. The only slack is the village-fire backstory, which tilts toward label-speak (“smelled of leaving”) rather than fresh sensory cost; still, the final shared exhale visibly pays the price of giving up astrological certainty for tidal breathing with Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. the crab-skittering unease—stays embodied in micro-choices (tracing sigils, kneeling to whisper findings). The renunciation at the end (leaving paths blank-labeled “Not yet”) carries felt cost: he forfeits finality for custodianship, a stance crystallized through the crater-glass beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “quiet authority of tides” moment crystallizes contradictory impulses—but the crowd remains typed (woman in red = exit-scanner, fisherman = jaw-tight patterner). The bishop transfer is a clean micro-choice, yet no visible cost attaches to him; the risk is off-loaded onto the woman. Earned Stasis is hinted but not dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tide-dancer’s vocation and exile are viscerally embodied—every ankle-flick carries risk—yet the stranger remains a cipher, their “reckless clarity” told not shown. Mareh’s memory-forfeit is a sharp micro-cost, but the brother-silhouette is abstract; we feel the ache but never knew the face. Interiority is lush, specific, lyric; still, the dyadic crucible never quite ignites because the client’s stakes are sketched in shorthand. The renunciation is earned, the flaw (clandestine empathy) drives the ending, so characterization lands just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glazier’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the contradiction between his reverence for light and the council’s cost calculus is embodied in every beat. His choice to ask for “one more day” crystallizes a hierarchy of values (craft over capital) with visible social cost. The only minor slack: Kade remains a functional foil rather than a crucible, so status dynamics don’t tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rafe’s contradictory impulses—protector vs. branded sinner—are dramatized in the smashed-box beat and re-activated when he palms the relic beside Maya; the trembling rookie mirrors the cost and keeps status dynamics legible. Interiority stays concrete (“scarred hand,” “tap against ribs”), avoiding label-speak. Final confession is earned by prior causality; the porcelain’s return as witness charges the closure. Voice stays singular; no secondary pressure from Maya beyond receptor, so relationship crucible is light.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich, consistent, and specific to the narrating logician-poet; the “three of me” overlay crystallizes contradictory impulses in-scene. Micro-choices (hanging orbs, swapping clippings) visibly enact the ethical calculus, and the final refusal to settle for “Unlifted” carries felt cost. Flaw: a brief therapy-speak label “grief steadied me” without embodied texture keeps this just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s listening obsession is embodied in soot-black fingers and humming ribs; the choice to stay and “listen until the walls finished dreaming” crystallizes a renunciation with cost. Inherited compulsion feels lived-in because micro-choices—rewinding the film canister, redrawing the map—track a hierarchy that prizes acoustic legacy over safety. Interior contradiction pulses: awe against dread, solitude against communion. No head-hop, no label-speak; the final stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush and painter-specific—“borrowed heartbeat” and prism-wet glass sight—yet choices remain observational until the girl appears; final joint song crystallizes a stance with visible cost, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s exhausted discipline and the insurgent’s barefoot knots give embodied contradiction; both men’s micro-choices (clutching the clipboard, touching ash) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete—“something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth”—and the final signature is earned by prior causality with visible cost: accepting “survivable disappointment” to stop the burning. The general’s scarred yet “operatively gentle” eyes show status dynamics without head-count clutter. Only the mayor remains a cipher, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is concrete—“a high, thin chorus would rise in my ears”—and the velvet-lined shoebox ritual embodies sentiment without label-speak. Micro-choices (circling the flats, kneeling in salt) externalize the contradiction between plunder and atonement. The final release is credibly driven by prior guilt and the echo motif, paying visible cost with the suit trousers whitening at the knees. Flaw: no second on-page character, so status/relationship crucibles are absent by scope.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iri’s interiority is consistently particular—her refusal to be “written on,” her calibration of gaze-timing, her choice to weave rather than jar the echoes—all manifest a lived-in contradiction between weaponized blankness and covert authorship. The embodied cost is legible: her humming body at the end carries centuries of unspent grief, making the smile an earned renunciation rather than a victor’s pose. No diagnostic self-labeling; even “chaste” is a social verdict, not self-definition. The only friction is that the palace’s status mechanics are asserted more than staged, so the power shift feels inferred rather than choreographed in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    Narrator’s urbane-calligrapher persona is vivid—ink dries fastest when people below are on fire—but micro-choices under pressure are thin; the “reverse confession” turn is declared rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Interior contradiction is present yet abstract; embodied emotion peaks early then yields to lecture. The final stance is credible, but the ache Lily’s version should have cost him is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Erin’s interiority stays concrete—her fingers choosing twig-by-twig, her ribs counting the wind’s stutter—so her esoteric-realist credo is enacted, not labeled. The knot-making grows logically from past helplessness (pigeons) and present micro-choices, ending in credible Earned Stasis: she keeps building although the butterfly will die. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene, not summary. Only minor gap: we never see her question the cost of her own fuel/food while the grotto drifts—tiny but keeps her from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The caster’s guilt-forged precision and the caretaker’s frost-bearded appraisal create a crucible of status and skill; every micro-choice on the rope reweights his failure into pliable memory. Interior contradiction pulses—he claims guilt is “burned out” yet the scrap throbs—until the rope literally softens his frozen shame. The final endurance (staying to cast sound not bronze) forecloses escape with felt cost: the bells keep chiming, so the apology stays molten.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—obedience vs. the lure of the road—is dramatized in concrete beats: the nightly dream ingressions, the tactile heat of the wafer, the final moment when he palms the seal instead of inserting it. His motivation pivots from bunker-loyal survival to path-desire through a visible accretion of sensory artifacts (gravel in boots, campfire taste) that embody the cost of leaving. The “precisely playful” trait surfaces in how he nudges the bunker’s logic, a micro-choice that later enables the climactic refusal. Cap stays just below 8.8 because the final stance crystallizes off-page; we see him step into the present but do not yet feel the embodied price of that first footfall outside.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete—his “frugal” trait shows in lived detail (paper > food, rented room). Micro-choices (tracing numerals, flicking breakers) reveal hierarchy of values. Flawed devotion drives the climax; the renunciation—shutting lights, embracing doubt—carries visible cost. No second character, so status dynamics N/A; single-POV voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s shift from blame to owning his guilt is embodied in the vibrating ribs at the end—an earned, physical cost. Ilen’s “scheming pacifist” trait stays abstract; he watches more than he pressures, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Interiority is intense and particular, avoiding therapy-speak. Micro-choice is visible: turning the silent key twice, each time tightening the emotional vise.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly idiosyncratic—his habit of noticing, the sextant’s hum against his palm, the way he negotiates self-erasure. Contradictory impulses (capture the dream / fear of vanishing) coexist in-scene, and the final porous fusion carries visible cost: his features dissolve into the corridor of glass trees. No stock labels; every beat is filtered through his maker’s perceptual lens. The only drag: the dream-figure’s motive remains slightly abstract, blunting the highest-stakes instant.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mender’s interiority is specific—quartz-eye, repair bag, ribbon fetish—and his guilt is embodied through the echoing nave. Yet the daughter remains a projection (vision in the apple) rather than an on-page force, so the relational crucible is off-stage and the final vow feels lone, not mutually tested. Still, his micro-choices (pruning, apology, ribbon as covenant) visibly cost him pride and safety, earning the renunciation of ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior overflow vs. cataloguing competence is concrete; the mirror-orchard beat forces a micro-choice that accepts nonlinear inheritance with visible cost—his own signature fruit. The blank pistachio cameo acts as an embodied blind spot, tying flaw to action. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent by scope. Endurance of paradox is earned, foreclosing linear safety; cost is felt in the final step through the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lysa’s interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, the act of tracing leaf-vein gaps—contradictory impulses (rewrite past vs. accompany brother) coexist in the final beat. Her “carefully resourceful” trait is not label-only: it drives the renegotiation with the clerk and the marginal inscription that rewrites the rescue mission. The brother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; the single-POV default is met. Closure choice is earned: the marginal note grows new veins, foreclosing erasure while accepting cost—an Earned Stasis visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—cataloging monsters for pay while craving release from that role—are alive in every beat; the twin’s invitation to “stay and rewrite” crystallizes an earned renunciation paid for by the burning hand on the emerald card. Interiority stays concrete (“the absence hurt worse”) and avoids label-speak. Cost is visible: the professional self is abandoned on the page. One hairline slip: the twin’s motivation to flee is summarized, not dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysa’s interiority is precise—her “warmly methodical” voice shows in micro-choices like touching the rope’s edge while weighing absences—but the arc is more attitudinal than transformative; the renunciation of sealed forgetting is felt yet causally thin. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she moves from curiosity to ethical editing without a visible fork that costs her professionally or personally. Still, her tactile historiography stays individual and the ending’s burden is credibly hers.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper’s calm, ritualized competence is tactile—tongue to stone, fingertip on basalt, marrow ring—but we never glimpse contradictory impulse; the mission feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. Because no alternative path is ever risked, the final “bloom of hush” registers as elegant execution, not costly renunciation—earned stasis without visible forfeiture. Interior voice is evocative yet single-note; the absence of micro-choice undercuts the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    Keeper’s contradictory impulses—stoic vigil versus aching need to hear his own child-voice again—co-inhabit every beat; the moment he presses forehead to glass and lets retrocognition “net” backward, embodied cost (bleeding dusk, mutinous knees) is palpable. His micro-choice hierarchy is legible: prism first, self second, universe last. The earned release of the child’s coordinates feels inevitable yet miraculous because his body has been paying the price for eleven years. No label-speak; even “retrocognitively blessed” is immediately lived—barefoot on thresholds, histories in lightless flashes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—pre-emptive nostalgia versus the need to erase memories—is dramatized in micro-choices (pausing mid-stroke, tightening chest). Embodied cost is legible, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship-as-crucible pressure. Final renunciation is earned: he accepts being “sculpted back” by the city. Voice remains coherent and particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The designer’s motive—turning despair into defiant light—remains concrete through tactile shell-sorting, charcoal sketching, and the fuse-tying micro-choice that seeds the climax. Interior contradiction surfaces in the walking chant that falters yet steadies his hands, showing simultaneous doubt and resolve. Embodied cost arrives when he lights the fuse: the ache-shaped question-mark becomes a fiery palm that risks burning him too. The stance crystallizes as Earned Stasis: he cannot stop the army, but forecloses surrender by gifting the garrison a sky-sized refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is richly concrete—salt-swollen notebook, fingertip dimpling the star—and the final “Let us go inland together” is earned by the slow ache of the pause. Flaw: the “I had built my work…” paragraph drifts into abstract self-diagnosis that momentarily flattens embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The claustrophobic child’s fear of underground spaces is vividly embodied (“unable to stand being underground for more than minutes”), and the inversion-hour trauma catalyzes a credible, lifelong quest to catalogue silences. Micro-choices—climbing, clipping in, pressing the doll to beams—reveal a hierarchy of values (silence over safety) with visible cost (falling doll, shared free-fall). The father’s single ascent is persuasively motivated by paternal worry and curiosity, and his unclenching shoulders enact a believable shift. The ending renunciation of mutual fear is earned, yet the interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“an intangibly tangible awareness”) that blurs moment-to-moment contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rian’s “fluidly logical” trait is shown rather than labeled—his micro-choices (killing the speakers, watching the blue line, pocketing the vial) all flow from that mindset. The interior contradiction is light: he risks his job for a superstition he half-believes, but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page. Passengers renounce noise rather than make hard choices, so their arcs are thin. Still, Rian’s quiet experiment earns a credible stillness that reconfigures the cabin, satisfying the 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ilya's interior contradiction—obedience to the future-dispatch yet refusal to fossilize memory—drives every beat; the ruby-press into the stair is a micro-choice that visibly costs him the throne, earning renunciation with embodied tremor. Flaws (curatorial caution vs adventurous sprint) complicate ascent and foreclose governance, satisfying earned-stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“the breath you held back… pooled in this hollow”—and her contradictory impulse to vanish yet still be witnessed drives every beat. The scar-linked memory transfer externalizes her lifelong pattern of self-erasing exits, making the final inhale a credible, earned pivot. Cost is visible: she has nothing left to burn. Minor hedge: “tired of hovering” edges toward diagnostic shorthand, but the next sentence grounds it in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s survivor guilt and bolt-as-anchor give her a clear, embodied motive that escalates to the hatch decision; the “quantum promise” stays abstract but the bolt’s cold weight keeps the stake sensory. Interior contradiction—fear of old greed vs. need to act—shows in her thumbs shaking while she texts, grounding epiphany in body. The final grasp of the wheel is earned: bolt clicks, knees steady, past scam self and present caretaker self converge. Micro-choices (checking moisture, anonymous notes) establish virtuous-mischief trait early so the volunteer reflex feels trait-driven, not plot-convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurel’s custodial fatalism is vivid and embodied; interior contradiction crackles as he “presses flat” the lethal ledger. The abdication signature becomes a lived scar, not backstory décor. Yet the queen’s younger voice, though chilling, is received passively—no fresh micro-choice re-opens the wound on the page, so the final cost is felt through sound only, not deed. Still, the refusal to re-write history lands as credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority remains concrete and particular; Calder’s “rust beneath his skin” and choreography of obeyed commands give embodied contradiction. Micro-choice at the masks—stay but not serve—pays for prior pattern of silent compliance. Mira’s constellational eyes and factual mysticism act as live pressure rather than label. Cost is legible: exile from neededness and from king.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tea thermos, dust-line photograph memory, the button held to light—yet her drive stays reactive; she never makes a visible choice that costs her anything. The “tactfully hopeful smile” is shown only once; the rest is summary. Because no alternate path is ever risked, the arc is observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lio’s interiority is concrete—kneeling to read puddles, throat aching after testimony—but the rebel identity is declared (“they called Lio harmless”) rather than shown contradictorily in-scene; the key’s persistence supplies motive yet the decisive act—speaking into the booth—is slightly under-motivated compared with earlier cautious pattern-tracing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The saxophonist’s contradictory hunger for novelty and later horror at the cost of his music are shown through concrete beats—playing the coded tune, fleeing the city, daily attempts to reverse the prophecy. His interiority is character-specific: the way he hears instructions “as shapes carved through negative space,” the bodily memory of the club’s dust in the final chord. The micro-choice to refuse the fatal notes in the grotto is earned by the slow accumulation of dread; the cost is visible in his exile and the eerie nostalgia that replaces triumph. No stock therapy-speak; every emotional label is filtered through sensory metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s fear of “almost but not quite knowing” gives a sharp interior contradiction that steers every micro-choice; the shift from passive sorting to active planting is legibly traced through prior causality and carries visible cost (the arbor’s embrace, the valley’s new story). Interiority stays concrete—”mossy delight tingling in veins”—never slipping into diagnostic speak. The monuments to forgotten things externalize values without abstract label, showing hierarchy in action. One flaw: the moment of decision is slightly under-dramatized—Lio’s final yes is reported more than embodied, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his lifelong habit of “trying to repair what did not quite work” crystallizes into the final gesture of giving clocks hands that “hesitate.” The contradiction between his need for certainty and the compass-rose imperative of Perhaps drives every beat. One flaw: the grandfather backstory is summoned rather than dramatized, so the admiral legend feels inherited, not earned. Still, the micro-choice to affix wobbling hands is a perfect, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eira’s interiority is palpably concrete—her refusal to accept “lost” is shown through the micro-choice of turning toward the foundry, not home. Contradictory impulses (stoic alchemist vs. sister who secretly followed) coexist in the same beat, not alternated. The final gesture—offering her own name as solder—earns its cost because every prior image of molten metal and corroded promises foreshadows the sacrifice. Only hairline gap: we never see her hands scald or breath snag, so the embodied price is implied rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and conflicted—she both fears and needs the gorge’s music—yet the “modestly fearless” tag is asserted twice rather than dramatized in a micro-choice. The crocodile-tooth ritual is a vivid, character-specific gesture that fuses memory and present action, earning her final laugh. No secondary character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the arc is a credible renunciation of pure grief in favor of hybrid laughter, cost felt when the wind “tilts” at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—pain is read “through flinches and heart stutters,” not labels—but the climactic decision to enter the frame is more symbolic inevitability than fresh contradiction; the spine-brace micro-choice helps yet the final surrender feels pre-scripted by the concept rather than a new fracture in self.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—“to honor overlooked histories”—is declared early and re-anchored in the guilt-shame beat near the end; the interior contradiction between professional detachment and moral debt is felt, not label-stated. However, no external pressure forces a live choice in-scene; the painter-alchemist is more oracle than antagonist, so the micro-choice that should crystallize cost is off-loaded onto later, off-page use of the shard. The “promise weight” of the shard lands, but the stance shift is prospective, not enacted here.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s perceptual gift and occupational lens are vivid and consistent; the decision to touch the mainspring is credibly driven by his curiosity and the children’s silent plea. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The flaw: we are told the ghosts cluster but their individual agendas stay flat, so the relational crucible never ignites; the boy’s cloudy eye is memorable yet does not complicate the final choice. Still, the micro-choice to read dust and the costly sight of the upside-down room land as earned, visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ilen’s contradictory impulses—obedience to library warnings vs. irrepressible drive to compress eternity—are dramatized in the frost-copying scene and the lever-pull, each micro-choice visibly raising cosmic cost. Interiority stays concrete (“eternity was still uncompressed and echoing everywhere”) rather than abstract; the final stance crystallizes with felt forfeiture as “eternity folding gracefully” accepts perpetual instability. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; motive remains singular yet sufficiently strained.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—revolutionary embers cooling into archival tenderness—grounds every micro-choice; the moment she palms the shard and old chants surface as questions, her re-tooling of rebellion is concrete, embodied, and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s quiet expertise and “wilts near dishonesty” quirk are vividly embodied; the interior contradiction between fixing songs and refusing false bargains drives every beat. Yet the Mayor remains a functional prop: no status shift, no competing desire, only expository pressure. The earned cost—Elias trades his secret melody and permanently warms the blackwood box—lands, but the external relationship stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—rational cartographer vs. psychometric visionary—are dramatized in the compass-touch beat; his micro-choice to jar the cave-air costs him bodily fear and forecloses retreat. Interiority stays concrete (“heat flared up his arm”) and avoids label-speak. The final boat-rock crystallizes his hierarchy of wonder over safety. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—wind “yanking,” sand “stinging like reprimands”—and her driftwood sculptor identity filters every perception. The slide-triggered self-cameo gives a hair-raising jolt of earned irony, yet her decision to “invite strangers” is announced, not dramatized, so the hinge feels slightly under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ira’s quiet obsession with “why flowers bloom at night” is concrete and embodied in paint-stained fingers; his decision to sketch murals that will smuggle the cathedral’s secret back into alleyways crystallizes a value hierarchy (art as confession vs. observer’s solitude) with visible cost—he forfeits sole possession of the answer. Interior contradiction is present but thin: we are told he trusts “stories” yet never watches him doubt that trust under pressure. The earned renunciation lands, yet the micro-choice that seals it (unfolding the sketchbook rather than speaking) is slightly under-dramatized, keeping the score just outside the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s interiority is specific—balancing on “the spine of history,” letting the past “scorch her”—and her micro-choice to kneel and whisper terms into the salt air crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (fear of contamination vs. hunger for truth) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final endurance—carrying the heavier diary—earns a credible renunciation of professional distance, foreclosing sterile detachment. Slight over-articulation of motive (“joined to uncover truth in tension”) keeps this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is dense, specific, and embodied (“shard lodged under tongue”); the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort drives every beat and forecloses his old life with felt cost. Working-memory training is dramatized through tactile ritual rather than label-speak. The only minor drag is the off-stage townspeople whose verdict is inferred rather than pressured in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lan’s interior contradiction—professional duty vs. dread of institutional prophecy—surfaces in the micro-choice to lie to Maro (“It is not for you”). Embodied ink-stained fingers and the slow-match of remembered phonograph whir give tactile individuality. Flaw is present: he clings to archival ritual under looming futility, and the cost—being the next voice in the spiral—lands as Earned Stasis. Still, we get no concrete beat where he nearly refuses or disobeys, so the renunciation feels intellectual rather than muscle-trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—curiosity about “borrowed time”—is dramatized through bodily contact with the cradle and the tidal breathing that syncs with their own. Interior contradiction is present: the refusal to “meddle” collides with the whispered decision to “pay in years.” The final acceptance carries a felt cost (the warmth threading foreign memories), satisfying Earned Stasis. Minor drawback: the grandfather’s role is told not tested, slightly blunting legacy pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “listening over noise” ethos is embodied in every beat—his winter splicing, his refusal to shout into the valley, his final step away from the switch. The contradiction between duty and creed is kept alive in muscular micro-choices (hand on rope, then retreat). Interiority stays concrete and sensorial, never drifting into diagnostic speak. The earned stasis costs the valley its early warning, and costs Elias the right to ever trust hush again—visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—“empathizing with the building,” “small tenderness he hid inside his work.” One micro-choice (taking the broom as staff) crystallizes the arc. Cost is legible: visibility over invisibility. Missing: a second character to test status, but single-POV default met.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    The keeper’s need to guard the covenant is embodied in daily ritual; the contradictory pull between speech and silence peaks when he opens the box for Mara. Micro-choice—lifting the lid instead of speaking—carries visible cost: color spills over the ghost, locking him further into solitude. Interiority stays concrete: his mouth refuses “what my silence could not do better.” The final renunciation (keeping the box as witness) is earned and forecloses return to the village of the living.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s quiet obsession with “the texture of time passing” is embodied through tactile rituals: palm on glass, reciting phrases to an urn, handwriting that crawls off the page. These micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values—memory over currency, calibration over explanation—without therapeutic self-labeling. The earned final realization (“we were the ones doing the lending”) grows directly from these accumulated gestures, so the internal change feels credible and costly. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper beat of visible risk or forfeiture would have lifted the score into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elian’s interiority is textured—his belief in “openings” and the embodied way he listens through the feather feel particular. Yet his contradictory impulses stay static; the final acceptance merely restates the opening credo rather than revealing a new fracture. The earned cost is present but diffuse: he “begins to write, line after unfinished line,” a gentle stasis rather than a foreclosed path. More pressure on his flaw or a cost that contradicts his original stance would push this into the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caretaker’s quietly fierce motivation—turning his own extinction into a living conduit between species—drives every micro-choice; the diary sketches, copper loops, and final surrender all spring from the same braided impulse of atonement and communion. Interiority stays concrete, sensing “a clock chiming underwater” and tracing tide lines while the doctor apologizes, grounding lofty ambition in tactile loneliness. His flaw—once “polished indifference”—is neither excused nor cured; instead it is re-engineered into circuitry that costs him breath and final solitude, earning the renunciation he accepts lying between root and stone. The only drag is a faint therapeutic register (“negotiating with his ribs”) that momentarily abstracts the body’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The luminous-skeptic persona is vivid and consistent; every beat filters perception through disciplined doubt, yet the interiority stays embodied (“I sensed no alien hum, only the bronze quiet”). No epiphany is forced—the final stance crystallizes as Charged Poise rather than conversion. The refusal to bow is dramatized in micro-choices (treating the route as question-mark, kneeling to read equations in dust), so the trait is motive, not label. Cost is felt: the path is taken, but belief is still withheld, leaving the narrator alone in the spiral with cooled metal silence as consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—carrying a pacifist botanist’s seeds across a militarized ruin while speaking only dead tongues—grounds every micro-choice (pod placement, listening posture, final whistle). His renunciation of human speech and acceptance of perpetual mourning are dramatized in embodied beats: kneeling to feel shrapnel quiver, brushing rust from knees, smelling rain-on-ash. No stock labels; desire is mapped onto bird-grammar and the lantern’s “narrow beam through infinity.” The closing whistle is Earned Stasis: he seals his exile with a cost legible in birds’ ragged chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive—using sound to re-bridge loss—stays consistent and personal; the stranger’s arrival forces a micro-choice to play the cylinder, exposing maternal grief. Barrow’s mournful attention embodies the stakes without anthropomorphic gimmickry. Interiority avoids label-speak; the final shared vigil is a credible, costly endurance. Voice distinction between narrator and stranger is slight, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete and specific to Elian’s perceptual signature—his breathing syncs with warped starlight, his charcoal trails literalize time-slippage. Contradictory impulses (longing for anchor vs. surrender to drift) coexist in-scene, culminating in the palm-on-viewport renunciation that forecloses safe protocol. The “blessed pariah” label is shown, not worn: his solo access andRule-bent authority accumulate across beats. Cost is visible: he crosses the ceremonial compass line physically and symbolically, accepting ostracism for a private cartography of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradiction-laden (“afraid and still climbing”). The micro-choice to trade the king-chess fear secret is specific and costly, earning the pivot from swagger to naked stance. Flaw: the emotional plateau after the lid opens is narrated more than dramatized, slightly diluting the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly concrete and character-specific; the crisis-actor past is embodied in the sensory memory of “fingers brushing shoulders,” not therapy-speak. Micro-choices—walking the apology into stone, refusing to shatter the boy’s ignorance—show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only drag is that the custodian relationship, though tonally potent, remains off-stage; his “benevolent ruthlessness” is reported, not dramatized, so the final stasis feels slightly under-catalyzed.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is rich and specific; the narrator’s shame about “crooked” family speech and the micro-choice to speak aloud in the niche are embodied and costly. The only flaw: the epiphany edges toward diagnostic summary (“I understood then that my talents for forgetting…”) just before the climax; a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elior’s guilt, tactile pawn-fidgeting, and shift from strategic pride to self-forgiveness are rendered through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final tug of thread carries visible cost: he discards the need for external redemption, crystallizing earned stasis. Interior contradiction is constant—precision vs mercy, pride vs shame—without diagnostic shorthand. Only the mayor’s frozen cameo keeps this from 9+; no live relationship crucible is tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maren’s fear/guilt is palpable in body and voice; Zev’s jagged charisma stays consistent. The moment she laughs through tears feels earned because the refracting questions have forced contradictions into the open. Interiority never resorts to therapy labels; instead, the canyon’s artifacts (bone stools, charcoal smears) externalize states. The final “knowledge of herself” is credibly priced by the night-long abrasion of her confession.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Corin’s contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while distrusting his own hands—are dramatized in the lung descent; the charm-lock click and glass-fracture word-etching are micro-choices that embody cost. Interiority stays concrete (“skin prickled as though regret itself were trying to burn through”). The earned shift from drifting tomb to page mid-sentence is credible because the causality of auric lattice + fracture repair directly springs from his traced pockmarks and voiced narration. No stock therapy-speak; flaws (doubt, shaking hands) actively complicate the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The painter’s interior contradiction—yearning to paint an impossible place while living half-detached from the living quay—keeps showing up in embodied beats (hands smelling of turpentine, clutching the child-shell). His lone trek and final decision to paint the mirror-pool are micro-choices that steadily foreclose retreat and cost him his remaining “temporary eternity” illusion. The flaw is largely aloofness itself, and it is confronted when stillness inside the cave forces him to externalize the private promise; the closing image of colors floating unmixed in the pool makes that cost visible. There is no second character to pressure him, yet his own nostalgic inertia supplies enough relational torque to earn the quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s shift from passive resistance to active “whisper” is embodied in the vial-handling beats; the moment she presses her palm to the lens is a micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—anger at the sea’s exhaustion versus tenderness toward it—kept live in the body (throat ache, dropped shoulders). The cost is visible: Jorah’s silence and her hammering heart. Only the grandmother memory flirt with summary, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rian’s prosthetic hand, brass-and-bone creak, and decision to lie “because sometimes raw solace is all that keeps a person moving” embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the cost of that lie is felt. Interiority is concrete, filtered through borrowed charts and phantom aches. Micro-choice—cupping the censer foot to steady drifting signals—reveals value hierarchy. Closure renunciation (mapping ruins for Mara) is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s involuntary truthfulness is dramatized—speech is ripped out “in sharp strips”—and the final refusal to soften perception lands as earned cost. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the dream-from-the-eye beat is the only moment where contradictory impulses actively collide in scene. Risa functions as sounding board rather than crucible, so status/relationship pressure is muted. Still, the narrator’s flaw drives every micro-choice and the closing stance, satisfying the 9+ quick test for causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse keeper’s motivation to offload “borrowed memories” is vivid, but the investigator’s turn to accept the boutonnière hinges on one persuasive line rather than a visible erosion of resistance; the interior micro-pivot is implied more than dramatized. Still, the keeper’s softly persistent cadence and bone-colored edelweiss create an unforgettable, specific obsession that charges every beat he occupies. The final pinning of the flower onto the investigator earns a felt cost, but the investigator’s contradictory impulses remain summary-level, capping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “empirically intuitive” trait is dramatized—he follows ants instead of a compass and weighs projected lattice-paths—so the final reach is earned. Interior contradiction is present but thin: we’re told loneliness “pressed” yet never see it war with his need to keep walking. The cost of stepping through is legible, but the sister-shaped hole stays abstract, blunting the emotional punch.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Isera’s refusal to wait and her insistence on climbing now crystallize a hierarchy of values—crown versus cosmos—yet the interior contradiction between queenly duty and star-called identity is asserted more than dramatized in body-level choice. The final step into the grotto is a genuine micro-choice, but the cost (abandoning harvest treaties) is off-stage, muting felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s watcher-inventor blend is sharp; the overheard gin-scene flashback crystallizes motive and flaw. Interiority stays concrete—“golden and sullen” sun mirrors self-doubt without diagnostic speak. Final “solving for us” decision grows cleanly from both craft obsession and friendship debt, cost felt in the act of inscription. Micro-choice hierarchy clear; could use one more embodied tick under extreme pressure to hit 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—"fog with teeth," "jaded wonder"—but the narrator’s contradictory impulses stay mostly reflective; no micro-choice in-scene forces a costly trade-off. The final hover above the graves is a stance crystallization rather than a decision, so the earned-cost bar for 8.8+ isn’t cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—once mapping emotion through scent, now through listening—pulls every beat; the micro-choice to let the client “remain an outline” externalizes her new instrument of perception. The screw’s installation is a visible, costly micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values: she forfeits technical purity to let grief into the machine. Client’s slumped shoulders and tin-rattle are embodied, specific; no diagnostic self-labeling. Relationship under pressure is the shop itself—its atmosphere acts as crucible, altering both parties’ stance in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lan’s interiority is concrete—“his thoughts…crystallized”—and the birthmark shard shows embodied shame in action. The final rune-acts are micro-choices that visibly cost trembling fingers and a literal scribed scar of light, earning the shift from hiding to bearing marks. Competence is balanced with struggle: he kneels, shakes, exhales. No contradictory impulses play simultaneously on-page, and the master remains a distant cipher, so relationship crucible is unused; hence held sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mirabel’s contradictory need to salvage both ego and friendship is embodied in every micro-choice (handing over the perfume, surrendering her column). The apology is dramatized, not labelled; her trembling thumb on “send” externalises the cost. Interiority stays specific to a journalist who thinks in headlines yet now drowns in metaphor. One slip: “thought…apology” flirts with summary; keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    No-One’s solitary vocation is vividly particularized; the way he counts “categories instead of heartbeats” shows a mind fused to its task. His final act—laying the dictionary into the blank center—externalizes an inner hierarchy of values under pressure. Because the story hinges on a single consciousness, relational crucible and status dynamics don’t apply, but interior contradiction is subtly active: he both clings to memory and relinquishes singular history. The cost is felt in the hush that “pealed outward,” a sonic image of his own erasure; this earns the renunciation without tidy emotional arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is rich—“seconds with razor edges, slicing days into bleeding filaments”—but the epiphany that clocks measure “the rate at which attention surrendered” arrives as an abstract declaration rather than a beat-forged realization. The key refusal is credible, yet the cost feels conceptual, not visceral; we witness renunciation but not the bodily price of it. Micro-choices (climbing, counting, setting the key down) are present, but none tightens the screw of consequence. Flawed but still a strong single-POV portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s spatial gift and ex-security past are embodied in every beat—how they pace the aisles, thumb the laser pointer, map the hangar as firewall. The contradiction between compulsive vector-tracking and the emergent need to “stop acting like walls” is dramatized, not stated, and culminates in a micro-choice that costs the old identity. Rae’s single line open-hand gesture stages a status shift that re-orients power without exposition. The final renunciation is legible because every prior interior calculation has shown us what is being forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s double identity—probability professor daughter of a compulsive gambler—drives every micro-choice: refusing to answer texts, pocketing the contradictions note, writing the counter-line on its reverse. Her “theoretically rebellious” label is embodied when she lets subway graffiti reroute her mood and trajectory, a visible cost paid in delayed hospital arrival. Interiority stays concrete, never therapeutic; her father’s twitching “slot-machine fingers” in sedation crystallize inherited risk without exposition. The final co-written note shows mutual re-stateing of their shared language, earned by prior pattern, with felt cost in her staying despite terrible odds.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s “cultivated estrangement” is dramatized through the glass-disc ritual and her refusal to join topside life; the interior contradiction—loner who needs strangers—drives every beat. Her micro-choice to keep Mara on the line is earned by years of wrong-number friendships shown in compressed flashback. The cost is legible: she stays alone in the tunnel, spinning silence back into the dark. Only the final beat drifts toward soft epiphany-speak (“narrow, echoing bridge”) that slightly blurs the embodied price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—ink-scented fingers, locket warming against ribs—but the contradiction between summoning Mara and claiming “I do not summon” is never acknowledged as self-deception, blunting the arc. Micro-choices (pressing photo, dipping pen, following footprints) track a clear value hierarchy; the final endurance of writing alone carries visible cost. Character voice remains singular and consistent; no label-speak intrudes. Missing only a sliver of interior contradiction to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kenji’s interiority is sharp and specific—his “desperately jocular” smile is shown through the hospital-corridor simile and his cautious sit on the bench. The contradictory impulse to cure loneliness while fearing chain-break is dramatized in the moon-rock hand-off, not summarized. His micro-choice to stay and listen until the loneliness shifts from singular to shared is earned and costs him the safe anonymity he arrived with. Mara’s elusiveness is functional rather than fully rounded, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orrin’s contradictory need to map others’ grief while refusing his own is embodied in every tactile beat; the final kneel-and-stay is earned because the ring’s inward pivot has been foreshadowed and paid for in cumulative emotional weight. No stock therapeutic labels—guilt is rendered as “rooms he had avoided.” Interiority stays strictly character-bound and blind-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“confidently uncertain” is lived, not labeled. The pen’s heat against ribs, the micro-choice to touch it to dust, embodies values under pressure; the brother-memory rewrite shows cost. No second character on page, so status bullets waived. Motive remains stable: thresh meaning to outrun exile. Endurance of dying still unfinished crystallizes with earned resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena’s signing of “spaces between words” is a vivid micro-choice that crystallizes her interior contradiction; the camera-as-hollow-eye motif externalizes her grief without diagnostic speak. The advisor remains a cipher—his “quietly charismatic” label never pressures her—so the relationship crucible is one-sided. Earned stasis lands: she forecloses verbal speech and accepts the camera’s silence, a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete, but the advisor’s absence of stakes caps the arc just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is vivid—“volcanic tenderness” and the rib-cage “doors” moment embody remorse—but the contradiction between arsonist and tender archivist is asserted, not dramatized in-scene; no micro-choice under fresh pressure tests the change, so the arc is more confessional than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“my nerves into film… relentless projectors” shows trauma physically. Drumming tic evolves into intentional signal, giving visible agency. Quiet rebellion stays consistent, culminating in perch choice with cost felt in “auroral sorrow.” Could use one more contradictory impulse mid-scene to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s tactile intimacy with the maze—memorizing creaks, reading footfalls—grounds every beat; the coin/key pocket-rituals embody his need to “turn” the port rather than merely survive it. The final whisper-triumph is earned because we saw him oil vents and fold impossible maps weeks earlier. What keeps this from 9+ is a slight emotional sameness under peak pressure: his calm never cracks, so the interior contradiction promised by the premise stays theoretical rather than embodied in a visible tremor or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dentist’s regret is embodied in the mirror’s trembling light on his certificates; the guardian’s calm is shown through water-circles that re-weight lamplight. Both characters act under pressure: the guardian teaches stars, the dentist dials the woman. Interior contradiction is present—fear vs. need—but the guardian’s “spiralingly calm” is asserted more than dramatized, muting micro-choice visibility. Cost is felt yet not sharpened to tooth-edge; the apology lands but the woman’s response is off-page, softening the bite.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Daniel’s quiet, chess-logic obsession feels lived-in; his “forests of second thoughts” motivation is stated early and re-iterated in embodied action (mapping town to board, phoning shops). Interiority stays sparse but specific—he “hears” unspoken words as rustling leaves—never slipping into therapy-speak. The micro-choice to cradle the leaf crystallizes his hierarchy of values and previews the later window-gambit; the renunciation of overt protest carries visible social cost in the muted ending. Milo remains a functional echo rather than a second full character, so relationship crucible pressure is light; head-count stays within bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s embodied labor and barbed tenderness are vivid; the final beat—pressing whalebone to ear—crystallizes her contradictory impulses. The old pirate’s status as secondary pressure is clear, but the interior cost of “refusing herself” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, muting the final turn’s ache.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    The performer's interior contradiction—State Joy Amplifier smuggling grief-acceptance—is vivid, but Mara's passivity flattens the crucible; her only micro-choice is compliant placement of the wooden figure, so the relationship under pressure never forces a mutual state-change. Embodied emotion (cooling tea, chipped mug) is specific, yet Mara's numbness stays summarized, not contradicted in scene. Earned shift lands in the performer, not Mara, so cost is felt asymmetrically. Still, the wooden hybrid as remade hush externalizes flaw and motive cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet fearing the cost—surfaces in the tremor he feels under the quartz; the final renunciation of the sanctioned “gratitude” poem is earned by that bodily memory of smoke and the colonnade’s answering hum. Embodied emotion stays specific: smoke “like punctuation stripped of meaning,” the lectern’s “tree rings of sound.” Micro-choice—stepping off the dais empty-handed—carries visible social cost (he forfeits official approval). No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV coherence strong.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-choices are vivid: Mira barters "awakenings," palms a warped reed, and refuses coin. The innocently-cunning trait shows in the instant she agrees to paint the unpaintable. Closure lands in earned stasis—she finishes the canvas and the plant blooms—cost paid in sleepless ash under her nails. Flaws are legible yet never diagnosed; interiority stays specific to her color-blind perception of "textures and temperatures of light."

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elya’s interiority is textured and embodied—her doubt is dramatized through the micro-choice of ignoring the clipboard and following color instead of score. The visitor’s arrival catalyzes a credible micro-shift that costs Elya her need to guide, replacing it with co-listening. Their open-ended stance at the end is an Earned Stasis that forecloses certainty, visible in the final “rough-edged texture” line. No diagnostic label-speak; all emotion is anchored in tactile bell-work.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ela’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices (folding ash birds, stitching herself into the dome); the shift from “closed-eye” rings to “shaky arcs” shows earned, visible change. Interiority avoids label-speak—grief refracts through light and metalwork. The final stance—sketching pieces for the almost-living—pays the cost of abandoning pure mourning. Riv remains a functional catalyst rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is off-page; head-count does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is specific—her fingers read the sigil “like braille”—and her motive to map post-collapse belief is dramatized through the tape ritual. The contradiction between nostalgia for data-driven certainty and her tactile cartomancy is present but could be sharper under direct threat. Jonas functions as skeptic pressure, not crucible; their joint placement of cards is the first micro-choice that re-weights their alliance, earning the change. Flaw is intellectual hubris rather than visceral risk; still, the cartomancer voice feels individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hiran’s hunger for forbidden knowledge is embodied early (“fingers ink-stained and trembling”) and drives every door-opening; the final vow to stay below shows credible renunciation with cost. Interior contradiction is present—trained to catalog yet choosing to inhabit memory—but not fully dramatized in a visible beat, so the contradiction feels more narrated than lived. The moment he lifts the veil and lets dust sting his eyes is a sharp micro-choice that externalizes the internal stakes. Absent on-page relationships or secondary characters, the crucible is purely intrapsychic; that works, but limits bandwidth for deeper status tension.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s regret-driven caretaking and his final vow to carry vanished futures are viscerally embodied; the river-stone bracelet cools against pulse, his wrists “press,” his pain “scorches.” Interior contradiction is alive: he both fears bruising dreams and invites a shadow to colonize his body. TheEarned Stasis closure—he will house wandering darkness for life—pays the cost promised by his opening belief that tending others’ lost possibilities can refill his own hollow. Minor slip: “regret felt useful instead of heavy” is a touch diagnostic; still, the embodied arc outweighs the label.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus the need to act—are alive in the workshop beat: she touches the vial, hesitates, then yields the tail to Mara. The micro-choice to surrender the relic is earned by prior causality and costs her the last talisman of her innocence. Interiority is concrete (“a matching gate unlatched”) rather than diagnostic. The only bar to 9+ is that Mara’s function is more thematic chorus than crucible; the relationship pressure is light, so the final renunciation feels slightly under-cooked in interpersonal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to close wounds yet compulsively reopening them—drives every beat; the graft failure and plant-telepathy force her to confront that contradiction in embodied, painful ways. Emotion is never labeled; it arrives as the itch of the shaved scalp, the laugh that hurts, the fingers drifting to the scar. The final renunciation—"some closures bloom only when you stop trying to seal them"—is earned by the prior cascade of micro-choices that bruise her further. Only the mentor’s "displaced miracle" line feels slightly diagnostic, keeping this just shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured: “spatially imaginative by nature; she felt buildings as organs…”. The deleted-film metaphor externalizes her life-long question; touching the strip becomes a micro-choice that crystallizes her history of unsent letters. The “ache she felt in the seconds after saying goodbye” is embodied, not labelled. Closure—her decision to see unused love as “unfinished reels” rather than failure—stems from prior causality and carries felt relief/cost; she forgoes the old self-definition. Projectionist is thin but functional as pressure-source; main focus stays on POV.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses—terror vs longing—are dramatized in the body (shaking hands → steady hands) and charge the surrender beat. The final stance ("direction had stopped hiding") is earned by the prior spiral of dust that empties the skull and stains the valley. Cost is felt, not just named; renunciation of safety is visible in lying down on cold stone. misses 9.0 only because interiority edges toward lyrical self-diagnosis ("shadowed rapture") rather than raw sensation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The guard’s compulsion to wind a silent clock and “sing the gaps” gives us a believable, embodied eccentricity; his internal contradiction—knowing arrival is impossible yet still keeping schedule—stays active in scene. Emotion is rendered through physical ritual (cupping sparks, pressing ear to glass) rather than labels. The final stance—awake witness to unborn journeys—costs him rest and sanity, a renunciation earned by prior obsession. Voice stays particular; no stock freight-guard clichés intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The interiority is evocative—"I called it the price of asking one question too many about reality"—and the gear-in-pocket micro-choice anchors the philosopher drift. Yet the stakes leap from barstool curiosity to bodily disappearance without an intermediate beat that shows the cost eroding his daily moorings; the vanishing-in-static moment is only reported, not dramatized, so the emotional escalation feels compressed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mara’s panic and the “gently persistent ache” that keeps her climbing are concrete and embodied; the contradictory pull between filial guilt and self-assertion stays active in-scene. The star punched into her reads as an externalization of an earned, costly first step rather than a magic fix. Yet her interiority dips into diagnostic shorthand (“she did not name it courage, only necessity”) that slightly blurs the visceral contradiction in the moment of assent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bellhop’s shift from obedient silence to spoken rebellion is embodied and costly; the phantom-labor frame lets us feel nerves re-knit while he re-lives the fall. Contradictory impulses—loyalty to guests vs. need to speak—crackle in the staircase moment where he touches the bruise and remembers dying. The final micro-choice, “Enough,” is small, spoken aloud, and paid for with literal re-shattering: causality and cost meet the 9+ gate. Minor slip: “seraphically mundane” is gestured, not fully dramatized in a second beat, capping the top sliver.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    The titan’s caretaker-versus-king tension stays mostly observational; his sole micro-choice is deciding to seed the messages, a decision told rather than dramatized with bodily cost. Interiority is vivid (“seasickness of the soul”) yet never cracks into contradictory impulse under pressure. Because the climax is the scholar’s recognition rather than his own stance shift, the arc plateaus at competent rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s tapping habit is vividly embodied and links past trauma to present vigilance; the decision to withhold the atlas page from colleagues shows a contradictory impulse between scientific duty and private obsession. The interior voice is specific—"swallowed stone," "inner register that counted dying corals"—but the arc remains observational rather than choice-driven, so the final nod-of-the-ocean moment feels atmospheric more than personally costly. Still, the flaws are nuanced and the characterization sustains atmosphere; no stock phrasing or competence-padding.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s contradictory mix of cosmic trust and bodily awkwardness is dramatized through bare feet on cold deck plating; the opera glasses as talisman show micro-choice under pressure; final communiqué is earned by prior interior build-up; no second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Teta Lila’s contradictory impulses—rebel matriarch and tender mentor—are dramatized in her scarred hands and calm voice blocking the council; the narrator’s plant-telepathy is embodied through slow resin-thoughts that bend choices. Interior contradiction peaks when the narrator asks the embryo a question no plant could frame, showing evolved values. Cost is legible: the amber cracks, the implanted lattice dissolves, and the council’s path is foreclosed. Micro-choice hierarchy is present, but the narrator’s final agency is slightly under-dramatized—more reported than acted—keeping it just outside 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mariam’s interiority is rich and embodied—tremor, shoulder ache, freeze response—each somatic cue particular to her past and present stakes. The contradictory impulse to map futures yet expect none is dramatized in the micro-choice of folding the photo into the notebook rather than discarding it. The “pearl of stillness” is credible renunciation with cost: she keeps the ruinous memory in reach yet chooses to write toward tomorrow. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; solo arc fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s crestfallen painter persona is vivid—his self-loathing for “painting people better than he ever touched them” is sharp, embodied, and specific. The internal contradiction between voyeuristic precision and emotional failure drives every micro-choice: sorting mildewed cards, dimming the bulb, descending the spiral. The final turn—painting “possible selves” instead of clients—pays off this flaw with visible cost: surrendering the old commercial identity. Secondary pressure is absent (no other embodied character), but the solo arc is complete and scaled to word count.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iren’s “serene anger” is embodied, contradictory, and anchors every beat; the memory of his frozen mother inside the ink vision converts backstory to present cost. Micro-choice—fingertips on cooling ink while “sense of self loosens”—earns the vanishing act. No status crucible (elders observe, don’t oppose), so relationship bullet not triggered. Interiority avoids diagnostic speak; “time does not slow; consciousness widens its eye” is perception, not TED talk.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ana’s interior contradiction—archivist obedience vs. illicit empathy—drives every beat; her gloved fingers refusing the incinerate command is a micro-choice with visible cost. The letter’s tactile handling (tracing, scanning, releasing) externalizes her hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. The final stance crystallizes a credibly flawed identity: coward, conspirator, living question. No secondary character on-page, so relationship bullets waived; solo arc earns Earned Stasis under subzero pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s pacifism is dramatized through micro-choices—tea for bounty hunters, pruning shears over knives—so the “senselessly perceptive” trait feels earned rather than labeled. The engraved-quite practice externalizes her internal conflict and produces a visible, continual cost (time, solitude, risk of ridicule) that compounds across the piece; the ending’s “another pulse” crystallizes the renunciation and its price. Interiority stays specific—airship sandbag smells of “rust and faraway storms,” never abstract therapy-speak. Only the father’s “Unerring” label and one or two adjective stacks flirt with cliché, keeping it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fisher’s refusal to voice his question crystallizes a lifetime of listening translated into a single act of withheld speech; the rail-spike burn and the salt-grief on his tongue make the cost visceral. Interiority stays concrete—"every unanswered question ever flung at the sky"—and the contradiction between his habitual transliteration and final silence is dramatized, not labeled. The choice forecloses the mythic promised payoff, a credible renunciation scaled to 800 words. Small slip: “not-knowing tugged at him more sharply than hunger” drifts toward abstract hunger-cliché, blunting embodied specificity one notch.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—inheritance loyalty vs. public exposure—are alive in scene; the rosewood nib squeeze externalizes the cost of her decision. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak. Micro-choice to “print against family” is earned by the prior causal chain; refusal of silence carries visible social cost. Only minor slip: father’s remembered voice is briefly generic, not specific enough to wound.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction is dramatized in the moment he decides to play the voicemail: grief recoils yet is overridden. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—amber totem vs. firmware, both handled in decisive beats. Final renunciation is earned: the living laugh dissolves the haunt, foreclosing the loop with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lark’s interior contradiction—whimsical sidewalk artist thrust into sacred duty—peaks when she presses the shard into sand and trades her “harmless” art for a tool that steals whispers; the cost (her former artistic innocence) is felt but not yet embodied in a single body cue. The boy’s grief supplies external pressure, yet his function is more catalyst than crucible; we never see his sketchbook again, so the relationship’s state-change is implied not dramatized. Micro-choice sequence—finger-smudge, kneel, draw—tracks values cleanly, earning the renunciation. Still, the chalk tin “sweating” never recurs as sensory anchor, missing a chance to embody fear under escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Laleh’s “hinge” self-definition crystallizes a believable internal arc; the steel arms embody the cost of her refusal to ration mercy. The micro-choice of pressing the tessera into the pillar is anchored in prior embodied emotion (scarred hands, pocket-weight). No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; solo arc earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lina’s synesthetic perceptions and Marcel’s fractured-stage selves give vivid, embodied interiority; both want the same thing (one true encore) yet approach it from complementary flaws—her color-hearing vs his applause-addiction. The tarot coin micro-choice (“she touched the rim”) anchors her offer, but Marcel’s final assent is still more gesture than costly decision—he risks little new. Their status shift (projectionist summons ghost) is legible, yet the relationship crucible stays intellectual; we feel no irreversible change in their mutual stakes. Closure is Earned Stasis for Marcel, yet the price is hinted, not dramatized on his part.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s interiority is textured—his synesthetic spill-over from stage lights into “cobwebs of possible choices” is vivid, and the contradiction between wanting to map others and needing sleep is on-page. Naya’s skepticism is shown through gesture (tilt of mica, sideways smile) rather than label. Micro-choice—Eli reaches with intention, not hands—earns the final shift; cost is felt when he admits “I remember everything, and that is the problem.” Voice convergence under stress is minimal; both registers stay distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Iri’s hybrid body and sensory vocation are vivid; the fossil-touch triggers a data-cascade and a felt pang, showing embodied contradiction. The floating renunciation crystallizes their charter into live cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning for the valley’s voice yet steeling herself to steal it—stays embodied in the hush she waits for and the lamp she sets down. Her quietly inspired trait is not label-only: it surfaces in the moment she whispers a smugglers’ counter-seal and tips the jar, trading obedience for the tangle of voices. The cost is visible: the warehouse’s new silence will mark her as traitor at dawn. One micro-choice—loosening the lid—reconfigures her stance and the city’s future; the canyon’s chord becomes her earned, perilous stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s burned-spy solitude is vividly embodied—every micro-choice (clutching the pillbox, comparing snow patterns) exposes the contradiction between instinctive vigilance and his need to believe repair is possible. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; tension between habitual watchfulness and emergent hope drives the final decision to wait rather than bolt. The earned endurance carries visible cost: he forecloses extraction and accepts continued exposure. Voice remains singular, but relational crucible is off-page; still, the Marha-haunted absence functions as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—needing to absorb others’ secrets yet remain porous—stays embodied in the tactile yarn-needle ritual and the moment he “held them all together.” Micro-choice (waiting three breaths, tracing circles) externalizes the palimpsest promise. Cost is visible: each crossing etches residue, and the final “shared, spindrift serenity” is paid for by his accumulated burden. Missing ≥9.0 because we never see a clear mistake or limit breached; his competence feels absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The potter’s interiority is rich and embodied—micro-choices (pinch of clay-seed, hand-hover over hive) betray his quiet, obsessive compassion. The causal chain from swatting-scout = salt-death to water-dish = bloom is slim but legible; the “sharp gentleness” toward his own past cruelty crystallizes a credible internal arc with felt cost. No contradictory impulses play out in live scene, only layered observation, so the 9+ quick test isn’t fully met. Still, the character reads as an individual, not a type, and his final stance of unguaranteed stewardship lands as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority—rooted in the cracked-teacup, stubborn-cutting pragmatism—remains concrete and embodied; the micro-choice to thread the tooth into a pendulum is a visible, costly pivot that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The contradiction between exposed-garden vulnerability and lockmaster’s hunger to carve safety is dramatized, not stated. No second character appears, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; head-count clarity is fine. The only friction is a faint label echo—“wistfully pragmatic” is voiced once too close to the climax, but it doesn’t flatten the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s interiority is richly particular—watching shelves drift like ships, feeling isolation as “raw material”—and the contradiction between solitude and connection plays out in embodied micro-choices (aligning the sundial, walking toward the catalog towers). The final renunciation of despair is earned by the mirrored self’s cautionary tale and the visible cost of lingering mist. Flaw: “brittle awakenings” is abstracted twice; a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is textured—echoes of unsent love letters as “a private archive” shows embodied contradiction—but the core want (find the thread) stays verbal, never crystallizing into a decisive on-page act. The final slackening is felt, yet it leans on atmospheric release rather than a visible choice that costs the ghostwriter a path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s rigor vs. trickster-hunter thrill—is dramatized in micro-choices (dial twist, slider nudge, apology to gear). Embodied cost arrives when she risks the station’s license and her own anonymity by feeding the debate into the Void. The “gambler setting the table” moment crystallizes earned change; tricksters’ answering swell confirms she’s no longer pawn. Flaw: cautious-hope trait is named more than embodied in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The explorer’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are embodied in every beat—measuring corridors aloud, forcing himself onward while lungs tighten. His grandmother’s spatial-mutiny myth is not backstory filler; it primes his decision to insert the compass point and descend. The final choice to accept transformation is earned by a lifetime of obsessive curiosity colliding with on-page terror. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Jonas’s prosopagnosia is dramatized through the act of painting grids on canvas and the interior refusal “he trusted emptiness,” showing a flaw that actively shapes method. The methodical trait is repeatedly paid off: every brushstroke is a micro-choice forced by his perceptual limit, and the final image of the ribbon fluttering is the earned cost of that limit. Internal contradiction is less present; his stance is steady, so the arc leans toward crystallization rather than fracture. Still, the blindness-to-sight reversal feels inevitable and specific to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—idealism versus the dread of repeating exile—are alive in every beat: she volunteers for a station she suspects is still a prison, copies forbidden verse into data, wears the nail that both honors and questions. Interiority is concrete (“copper nail…a talisman and a question pressed to her skin”) and degrades under sweat-dread. Micro-choice to tag Tamar’s stanza as climate data is the hinge that forecloses her own innocence and costs her the official record; the price is felt. No safety-hedging: she perpetuates exile to reverse it.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fiddler’s ache, luminous disbelief, and compulsive playing are vividly embodied; the micro-choice to tuck the glass flake under the bridge literalizes his interior contradiction. His decision to play the second, merciful song is earned by the memory of his own near-leap and the stranger’s earlier refusal. The hitchhiker’s returned presence proves the amnesty worked, paying the visible cost of the shattered flake and the fiddler’s spent bow. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; every beat is filtered through a musician’s sensory idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s voice is vivid and idiosyncratic, with a perceptual signature built from criminal childhood texture and startup wreckage; internal contradiction shows in the simultaneous pride and shame attached to the same inherited bills. Micro-choices—returning to the train, spreading the worthless currency—embody values, but the epiphany “mistake inheritance for destiny” is stated rather than dramatized, muting embodied cost. The father remains off-page, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; the single on-page character meets single-POV standards. No diagnostic label-speak, but the final line drifts toward thematic abstraction, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but the healing “witnessed” in the last line is asserted, not dramatized; no micro-choice or visible cost on the page makes the change legible. Aria’s status as listener-counselor is sketched only through soft dialogue, so the relationship crucible never pressures a decision. The dream chronicler identity drives the setup yet fades once the mapping starts—no contradiction shown between paid job and private obsession under pressure. Earned stasis is implied but not anchored in a renunciation or forfeiture we can point to.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlen’s trait “feels absence the way others feel wind” is vividly particular; his circling awareness under ice shows embodied motive. The final whisper “I changed everything” crystallizes a cost—he swaps passive grief for active agency, foreclosing denial. Interiority stays soil-tasting concrete; no diagnostic label-speak. Sister’s absence drives every beat; motivation never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The visionary’s root-bound paralysis is viscerally embodied; the fused scars throb with each choice, and the final shared vision costs blood and agency. Lio’s skeptical curiosity is credibly shaken, but his interior arc is slightly under-drafted—his shift from “show me” to “we cannot cut or keep” feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices. Still, the mutual flaw—neither can act without the other’s wound—creates a crucible that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s “reckless idealist” tag is shown, not told, via the orchard ritual that costs him vitality; the narrator’s guilt is embodied in the hand-on-cloth beat. Both characters evolve—Lio dims, narrator steadies—via causally linked micro-choices. Interiority stays sensory (“air tasted like rust and pomegranates”) rather than diagnostic. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-labeling in “my own soul felt like moth-eaten cloth,” −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eli’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing facts to mute grief while secretly yearning for the old tour rush—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to write “Provenance uncertain, but history priceless” costs him professional neutrality and re-opens the ache he’d tried to archive. The memory of the singer looping a cable round his neck like a medal crystallizes status-flip and foreshadows the later sting of the grille-cloth find. No therapy-speak; the body remembers amp weight in wrists and knees. Closure renounces certainty for a fragile stewardship of story—felt cost scaled perfectly to vignette length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s translator’s patience and haunted ambition coexist in every beat; her decision to “reestablish what you have already taken” grows directly from the guide’s vanish and her own craving for knowledge, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete—teeth aching, seed rolling between fingers—without therapy-speak. The only flaw: “kindly methodical” is declared more than dramatized in micro-choices, a −0.4 dent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s hinge-hearted, brass-boned interiority is vividly embodied; every micro-choice (accepting contradictions, smelting selves) grows from the established mechanical-flawed self. The fisherman’s wan-dering identity is shown, not labeled, through his triple gaze and shivering question. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, only summarized across paragraphs, keeping it just below the 9+ gate. The final shared reflection is a credible, costly renunciation of singular selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is precise—her fear of “certifying tombs” versus her hunger to reopen hearts—embodied in the way the clipboard drops useless at her side. Contradictory impulses (professional verdict vs. spiritual confession) act simultaneously in the decisive beat, and her micro-choice to speak aloud costs her the detachment she prizes. The only bar to 9.0: Rafi remains a silent echo rather than a second pressure crucible, so status dynamics stay one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s self-loathing, guilt, and compulsive cartography are viscerally embodied; every beat keys off concrete stimuli—the taped bellows, the graffiti line—so interiority never floats. The final micro-choice to write his own name beside his brother’s is credibly purchased by the accordion reprise and the graffiti’s repositioning of shame. Flaws (exploitative ambition, emotional freeze) actively shape the present-tense choices; no therapeutic self-exoneration intrudes. The only minor drag is a few abstract self-diagnoses (“I had archived him as content”) that momentally dilute embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer’s contradictory hunger for discovery yet fear of finality is embodied in micro-choices—testing coughs, pacing silence, finally dissolving her resignation letter—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“ink felt like dragging chains across the carpet of the air”). The only bar to 9 is that the second-letter reversal is single-sentence shorthand; we feel relief but not the full cost of abandoning her old life.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The researcher’s refusal to authenticate is earned by the accumulating plant-whispers and coffee-stain doubts; the interior contradiction between scholarly duty and moral revulsion is palpable. The final marginalia act crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible professional cost. Only the telepathy trait remains a shade too convenient, slightly blunting the flaw-compound.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—artistic reverence vs. mortal dread—are enacted in micro-gestures (chip to sternum, not brow). Her final, trembling relocation of the emerald to Isren’s heart is the earned, visible cost that forecloses her own emotional escape; this single action outweighs the ornamental freckle-detail earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—kindness as both roof-mender and carrier of unspoken scorched silence—survives the entire climb; the decision to plant the mirrored seed is earned by the vision of herself as betrayer and betrayed, paying the cost of relinquishing the hairpin that once pinned grief to her scalp.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory fear—loving one person more than strangers might make her “smaller”—is dramatized in the moment of choice and revisited under pressure; the narrator’s refusal to flip her coin lands as credible renunciation with visible cost (“shoulders loosen as if muscles remember mercy”). Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and tracks embodied emotion. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not scored; single-POV interior arc fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s paradoxical youth/age and Mora’s anticipatory tremor are viscerally embodied; the refusal to deliver spectacle is a credible, high-cost stance. Micro-choices—palm opening, basin brightening—map precisely to “withhold” motive. Interior contradiction is present yet mild; the lesson lands as renunciation rather than irreversible loss, capping score at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    The interior contradiction is exquisite: a ferryman who must stay still, a pulse-chaser who renounces motion. Embodied emotion arrives in the “faint tremor of the bone towers” against his spine, a literal vibration of past intent. Micro-choices—pebble angles, breath timed to wings—reveal a hierarchy of values where listening > arriving. The Earned Stasis lands with felt cost: he forfeits every future journey, becoming the canyon’s tuning fork forever.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orren’s chronic underachievement is vividly embodied—his every tremor at heights, his reflexive disobedience of the harness, the way the stone’s warmth hijacks his hand. Flaws complicate the final step: fear of falling collides with desire for transcendence, forcing him onto literal mist. The interior contradiction—self-scorn vs. hunger for meaning—stays active in scene, not summary. Cost is felt: the archive job, already a life’s exile, is left behind without safety net.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradiction—truth-teller who fears commitment—drives every beat; the underwater vow he finally utters is the earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“green ringing that rang against his ribs”) rather than abstract. The only cap: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible untested.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cast-lots decision maker’s renunciation of his own method is embodied and specific—he “did not scoop them up.” Interiority stays concrete: “stellar doubt flooded me.” One contradiction is active: surrendering randomness is both liberation and amputation. Cost is visible—he trades his defining role for unshared responsibility—yet Tamsin’s pressure feels under-charged; her enthusiasm never really tests him, so the relational crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s grief is concrete—his hollow chest, the lantern that “strictly refused to die,” the atlas he handles like a surgeon. Interior contradiction pulses: he both courts and fears each fear he names. The final renunciation—witness, not destroy—is earned by the child-memory that still “cuts,” and the cost is felt in the crystalline shards he keeps instead of souls.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lukewarm mage’s flaw drives every beat; the drip-count renunciation crystallizes her hierarchy of values (cosmic fairness > personal competence) with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tomas’s grief-bound vigilance is embodied in the slowed footfall and coat-pocket relic; the final decision to speak rather than warn is prepared by every rivet he ever tightened and the ache of the steeple photograph. Interior contradiction—engineer’s faith in structures vs. need to voice stories—stays active in scene, not summary. Micro-choice of holding up the photograph to the neighbors crystallizes his earned shift from private caretaker to public rememberer with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s secretly-sentimental trait is front-loaded (“folded scrap of childhood lullaby”) but never triggers a micro-choice with visible cost; the final three-degree lens twist is driven by breathing-sync, not the hidden lullaby. Interiority is lush yet stays safely poetic, never letting flawed irrationality complicate the experiment. The earned change lands as perceptual, not moral, so the absence of a concrete price tied to his sentimental pocket keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight watcher’s interiority is character-specific, embodied (parachute-buckle breathing, finger-tremor on dials), and drives every micro-choice; the final report-filing is an earned renunciation with visible cost (“weight of my choice”). Grandmother remains off-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; no contradictory impulses appear simultaneously in scene, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—"I did not want to win by hollowing him out" crystallizes the self-vs-clone tension. Guilt over the surgeon is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choice to lower the blade is earned and costs the narrator any easy victory, satisfying earned stasis. Voice slips toward diagnostic shorthand once ("almost like real fear"), but overall the arc from numbness to trembling choice is dramatized, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s curiosity-driven interiority is concrete—his “puzzles spiraling in impossible geometries” shows obsession under pressure. The seed-planting is a micro-choice that visibly costs his complacency, satisfying the earned-change test. Missing a second beat of visible trade-off keeps this just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s grief-as-tuning-fork is vivid, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the contradictions of “mournfully eager” are lived in each pull-cord gesture. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the final renunciation (letting the engines die while laughter leaks upstairs) is earned by the prior sonic labor. Flaw: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; headcount stays coherent. Cap invoked: closure not touched, but 9+ gate requires 8.8+ here, and the slight emotional ventriloquism of “he understands” summary just below final beat keeps it at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “dimensionally homesick” narrator’s ache is lived in every beat: the mist tastes of paper dust, the pendant corridor forces a literal self-confrontation, and the final acceptance of perpetual uncertainty carries embodied cost. Guardian’s thorn-feet, ember-pendant sniff, and refusal to name herself all manifest her contract-bound ferality. Interior contradiction—craving both exit and enclosure—drives every micro-choice; the moment the narrator pockets the pendant he simultaneously surrenders and claims agency. The only polish missing is a hairline beat where the guardian’s personal stake in his choice surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Corren’s contradictory impulses—despair versus last-ditch agency—are dramatized in the ember ring: he both flinches from heat and leans in. The final redirection of the crozier’s blessing is earned by a lifetime of recalled failures and the embodied cost of scorched gloves and ash-clogged breath. Interiority stays concrete (“resonance of all the times he had turned away”) and avoids label-speak. The only restraint from 9+ is that the cost, while felt, is not yet allowed to scar him onstage; he exits lighter than the moment demands.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation and private ache are lucid from the first paragraph; the shard-on-tongue moment bodies the internal contradiction between rescue and destruction. The final compromise—teaching the towers to dismantle themselves slowly—grows believably from that duality. Cost is felt: the shard dissolves, heartbeat syncs to dying steel, and the city’s wish is neither denied nor fully granted. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible inert.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eli’s interiority is concrete—his “quiet miracle” of 712 returns, his priest-like caretaking—but contradictory impulses arrive late and stay verbal (“he might merge parallel timelines”). The final “he chose home” is decisive yet un-earned; we haven’t seen him weigh any competing choice or fear, so the cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator’s desire to remember without hurting is concrete and embodied through the weaving action, but the fever dream architect remains a cipher whose motives stay off-page; this limits relational pressure. Interiority is vivid yet drifts into abstract pronouncements (“anesthesia for the soul”) that feel diagnostic rather than lived. The final stance—wrapped thread, no step—earns a credible Earned Stasis, yet the lack of visible consequence for the architect blunts the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The instructor’s ache for star-navigation is embodied and consistent; the anchor-chain keeps memory alive in every beat. Internal contradiction—comfort in the abyss vs. longing for open sky—drives the silent yes to Mirror’s invitation, paying the cost of sleep and safety. Micro-choices (unclasping the chain, pressing it to glass) crystallize values without diagnostic talk. The only block to 9.0: we see ache but no irrevocable tactical loss inside this single scene; the cost is atmospheric, not yet lived.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eren’s “persistent curiosity” is dramatized: it delays protocol, drives him to the apartment, and finally makes him phone Deniz. His interiority is concrete (“the hearing aid…ticked like a finger on his wrist”) and the final choice to phrase the message exactly as the pulses dictated shows a hierarchy of values with visible social cost—he risks breaching municipal rules to deliver a private absolution. The contradiction between bureaucratic duty and empathic trespass is held in scene, not summary. No stock therapeutic labels appear; the flaw complicates rather than solves the case.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Noah’s contradictory dread of metal tunnels (contrasted with honest rock) and his simultaneous need “to stand by the unremembered” create a live interior fracture. The moment he pockets the gold-flecked codex, both motives collide—greed/curiosity versus reverence—pushing him deeper instead of back to safety. The claustrophobic panic is fleshed through breath, visor flash, negative-mass sphere, not labels. Only missing a sharper cost-on-page at the final beat (he “turned” but panic and conscience are not re-weighed in one embodied beat), capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“count heartbeats constantly” becomes embodied tic; contradiction (grief vs. scientific rigor) drives every micro-choice. Final coding decision is earned: spilled-ink epiphany grows from three winters of failed rebuilds. Static absence between the two deaths he assigns himself supplies credible flaw and cost. Voice specificity slips once into generic “frightening stillness”; still, arc is individual not trope.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s interior contradiction—accepting the diamond’s curse to save a language while knowingly braiding himself into its erasure—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the stone to the wall, accepting his voice joining the bone choir). His refusal to retreat (Earned Stasis) carries visible cost: his own voice becomes part of the canyon’s dying lexicon. The only drag is slight over-articulate interiority in peak beats; diagnostic label-speak is avoided, but the throat-scratch syllables edge close. Still, motivation scales neatly from personal mission to self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator-researcher’s undercover motive is vivid and embodied (pulse in soil, phone hiss); interior contradiction—wanting taxonomy yet awed—drives every beat. Final acceptance that mapping fails feels earned because the earlier grid reflex is repeatedly thwarted by tactile wonder. Cost is visible: professional horror sharpened into complicit silence. Flaw: “Maybe work now…” drifts toward diagnostic label; keeps this just outside 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s contradictory desire to awaken beauty while fearing the orchard’s call is clear; his micro-decision to bow-stroke the orchard’s pulse, not the city’s, is dramatized on the page. The final renunciation—stepping onto the bough without stopping the music—carries visible cost (arms aching, locust shell clinging as ghost-coda). Interiority stays concrete (“taste of years,” “soil and sorrow”) rather than diagnostic. Only minor stutter: we never see how the fear of losing daily bread actually felt minute-to-minute, so the risk stays slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eren’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“counted who was missing”); his micro-choices under checkpoint rifles show a hierarchy of values. The mail-drop ritual and bottled-storm trust display internal contradiction—respectful bow vs. secret rebellion—acted in-scene. A visible cost is implied: if the storm fails, the fragile neutrality he ferries collapses. The only minor drag is the late, slightly abstract phrasing of “broken promises heal” that edges toward label-speak, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eli’s interior contradiction—repairing carousels while keeping his own heart stopped—is dramatized through the tactile act of singing life into the horses; the final “quiet click” of fear slipping out rewards the prior causality. Micro-choices (touching the cage, starting to sing) visibly re-weight his hierarchy of values. Cost is felt: he forfeits his protective silence. One slip: “words failed whenever he tried to speak” veers toward diagnostic shorthand, blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mariel’s “sanely eccentric” label is shown through concrete ritual (receipt-maps, star-marked pauses) and a quiet hierarchy of values—cataloging hesitation matters more than sleep or safety. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens; no therapy-speak. The final stance—renouncing the need for a physical locus—carries cost (her diagrams collapse into “a posture of attention”), satisfying earned stasis. Yet the flaw is passivity: she observes, maps, follows, but never risks altering the library in a way that could fail; the climax is recognition, not choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Irena’s contradictory pull—professional caretaker of memory, personal seeker of an unnamed absence—drives every predawn climb; the hollowing cost of each sunrise theft is shown in body and camera, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“curiously hollow,” “catalog she had not yet been allowed to read”) without diagnostic labels. The final stance—continue the ritual while bearing the unnamed loss—earns its stasis through prior causal chain; the cost is visible in her carried emptiness. No secondary character applies relationship crucible, so bullets ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interior arc is lucid: the narrator’s fear-guarded idea moves from paralysis to self-forced release, each micro-choice (handing over the vial, thanking fear) grounded in prior causality. The locksmith stays enigmatic yet decisive; his “key-watching-door” stance crystallizes status without exposition. Cost is felt: once the vial opens, the old safety is foreclosed—no backpedal possible. Flaw: “improbable longing” is named, not embodied; one label-speck keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The folklorist’s curiosity and the cost it exacts stay vivid, but the final beat leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“this was simply what happened when habits break”) rather than a dramatized micro-choice that seals the bargain; the interiority is otherwise embodied and the amnesiac grief feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rhea’s contradictory impulses—protective tenderness and tactical ferocity—are alive in every micro-choice: the heel-of-hand door-close, the blade-smile promise that forgetting Jun will hurt. Her interiority is concrete (“gut tightened,” “walks backwards when nervous”) and complicates action in real time. The final vow to “hold the exit open as long as my hands remember how” crystallizes a costed renunciation that is fully earned by the scene’s causal chain. Interior contradiction and embodied emotion remain consistent even at peak pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s shift from numb exile to tentative planter is embodied in the trembling warmth of the seed-touch; the final “first true hope” lands because we watched the gray city memory tighten around the choice. Lior’s function as mentor is thin—no interior contradiction or visible cost—so the relationship crucible never ignites. Still, the narrator’s micro-choices (watching, imagining, watering with memory) earn the Earned Stasis closure with felt cost: the city remains gray, the orchard merely offers a thread.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ilan’s interior contradiction—healing others while nursing his own unhealed wound—surfaces through micro-choices (needle placement, whispered refusal to the voice) and culminates in the Earned Stasis of accepting the name’s cost. Embodied grief is vivid, but the brother-loss backstory is relayed in a 42-word block that does not tilt the present stance; still, the moment-to-moment tremor in his wrists and the whispered bargain supply enough corporeal cost to satisfy the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “methodically curious” temperament is embodied in how he measures the millimeter he later lies awake missing; the same trait drives his decision to re-open the chapel “only as a place to listen,” a renunciation that costs him certainty. Interiority stays concrete—he “feels his guardedness flex,” sees “the millimeter widen into a road.” The absence of on-page opposition dilutes pressure, so the final choice, while earned, lacks a crucible moment; still, the quiet endurance fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s “quietly analytic” nature is shown, not told, in the clinical way he inventories the drowned library and measures panic; the decisive choice to compromise rather than fully salvage or abandon the experiment is credibly rooted in his lifelong habit of partial recovery. Interiority stays concrete—gloved brush against a snow globe, hesitation before prying the cylinder—without therapeutic self-labeling. The cost is visible: the closing “compromise that felt like mourning” lets the sea keep part of the data, foreclosing perfect certainty. Slight deduction for late arrival of the physicist’s motive—our first real glimpse comes inside the note, so the narrator’s identification with him is more asserted than dramatized in earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lio’s muteness, paint-stained fingers, and final “Use me” crystallize a credible arc from proxy-artist to conduit; the embodied tremor of the flower-press key against hot brass gives visible cost. Interior contradictions—shyness vs. hunger to speak—are dramatized in the graffiti circuitry instead of label-speak. No second character on stage, so relationship bullet skipped; headcount stays coherent. The closing surrender of authorship to the wall hits as earned stasis with skin-level price.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Etta’s warmly inquisitive nature is shown through embodied micro-choices—timing the theft, rehearsing lies, pressing the door with apologies—so the trait drives the plot. The diary reading reframes her own past injuries into annotated joy, a credible internal change that costs her the safety of ignorance. The “ascending servant” descriptor is repeated but never dramatized as status threat; hence not quite 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her grief-turned-inquiry feels lived-in. The contradiction between scientific duty and grief-led experiment is embodied in micro-choices—volunteering to stay, pressing palm to glass, deciding to log “no mechanical cause.” No second character present, so status/relationship bullets skipped. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she knowingly lets the city sleep while she drifts, relinquishing rescue for data. The only friction is slight over-articulation of the thesis (“spooled wholeness”) twice, blunting immediacy a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s face-blindness is dramatized through tactile ritual—fingertip shelf-reading, coin-reading by touch—so her flaw actively shapes tactics; the final “frame as gift” renunciation is foreshadowed by her earlier sky-painting ethic, so motivation holds. Interiority stays concrete (“light did not escape her”) and avoids label-speak. The missing .3 owes to no second character on-page to test status dynamics; within single-POV default that is not a demerit, but 9+ gate demands the full checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s curiosity is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—chalk transfers, notebook overlays, whispered square-counting—each tightening the risk ladder. Interior contradiction appears when awe competes with the fear of being “dashed against a mountain,” keeping emotional calibration honest. The final stance crystallizes: Lio accepts sole risk-logging authority, a visible cost that forecloses the apprentice’s safe anonymity. Voice stays particular to a star-drunk map-nerd; no competence overruns genuine precarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The locksmith’s interiority glimmers—his nostalgia “like old driftwood” is specific—but he never faces a hard choice that costs him anything. The mirrors ask for repair, yet he stays a cipher: no contradiction, no visible flaw, no moment where he might fail or refuse. The “rhythm of repair” remains an abstract want; it never rubs against a counter-desire or stakes his body or reputation. Closure is gentle thaw, not earned renunciation, so the arc feels observed, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kerran’s ghost-organizer identity is vivid and unique; the after-death petitioning instinct crystallizes in the chalk-route gambit. Interior contradiction appears only in the single memory-flash of hospital drowning—powerful but isolated. No embodied emotion under the final bell-shatter; the gratitude-tangle is asserted, not shown. Still, the spectral POV stays consistent and the altruistic flaw drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The adjuster’s contradictory motives—to keep the child’s relic yet still act—are palpable in the puppet’s placement, but his interiority sometimes drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“he understood then…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (speaking the sequence, palm on glass) are present and costly, yet the pivot from global saviour to lullaby-whisperer is asserted more than dramatized. Relationships are memory-only, so status/secondary-pressure bullets are N/A; the reflection % is high but within the allowed ceiling and anchored to present stimuli. The arc lands as credible renunciation, but the emotional cost is more declared than corporeally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—duty to guide versus the orchard’s hunger—drives every micro-choice; the nut’s burn in palm embodies cost. Voice stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The final recognition that the blueprint *wants* to be remembered crystallizes a believable, weary acceptance. No safety-hedging; moral ambiguity stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s guilt-driven interiority is vivid and embodied—e.g., the “cavernous silence” of her promotion—but the brother Leo remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible can’t activate. The pivotal micro-choice (carrying the chrysalis to the ravine) is understated; cost is felt yet not sharpened by on-page opposition. Flaws (avoidance, over-cerebral grief) shape tactics, yet the final stance shift reads more meditative than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vendor’s quiet, self-interrogating interiority is vivid—his practiced attempt to “incise on its surface a single true question” shows embodied contradiction under pressure. Yet the woman’s arrival abruptly externalizes the conflict; her motives remain sketched by rumor rather than revealing micro-choices that would let us see her fatigue alter tactics. Because the vendor’s final step into “margin” status is more epiphany than externally tested decision, the cost reads as conceptual rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rafi’s sensory curse and monk-like self-protection are viscerally embodied; every micro-choice—sleeves over skin, three grains of remorse—springs from an internal contradiction we feel in real time. The refusal to let the soldier’s massacre enter the stew is a credible renunciation that costs him visible tremors, earning stasis. No stock phrases; even “sturdy brittle calm” is a lived paradox, not a label. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into therapeutic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized in her immediate, tender reply to the silo and in her sustained mediation among volunteers; the palm-to-steel beat shows embodied empathy driving choice. Interiority stays concrete and music-lensed (“floury accents,” “corn dust and locomotive breath”). The slight abstraction in “vigorously tender” is offset by visible micro-choices—opening hatches, guiding choristers—so the trait works as motive, not label. Cost is present but diffuse (exhaustion implied, not staged), keeping her just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s helix-minded obsession is shown through concrete gear-work on the periscope and the neural splice, not label. His renunciation—offering his own cortex as archive—pays the stated cost (“tears slipped… weight of finally belonging”) and is foreshadowed by earlier aborted prototypes. Interiority stays concrete: “spiraling in double helices around a single aim.” No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only summarized, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s split-mind training and “prism-minded” perception are shown through how he deciphers the doodle and endures threshold effects; interiority stays sensory, not abstract. Choices—pressing palm, breathing through layers, offering pulse to chains—are micro-costed and drive beats. No second character, so relationship crucible N/A; the sole flaw is no visible flaw: competence feels absolute, muting jeopardy. Still, a credible endurance with cost is earned: he absorbs world-shielding combinations that now live behind his eyes, foreclosing future ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—yearning for sound in a world that forbids it—drives every beat; his embodied tremor when the grove sways shows cost without label-speak. The micro-choice to strum copper rather than preserve bark crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Ina’s scarred palms and silent rebuke supply secondary pressure that alters his tempo. Earned stasis lands: the music will never reach ears, yet he accepts the perpetual ache inside his ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Oren’s contradictory motives—loyalty to the boy versus self-preservation—are dramatized in the remembered rook sac and in the final whispered prayer; each micro-choice (kneeling, aligning the stone, accepting the covenant’s revision) carries visible cost. The exile-as-move conceit gives his interiority a concrete, idiosyncratic shape that peaks when the dent in the stone deepens—an embodied record of shared futures. No stock therapy-speak; even the abstract “beauty in the difficult” is filtered through the boy’s voice and later re-priced by stone and silence. The earned shift from condemned piece to repositioned player satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s pacifism is dramatized through on-page micro-choices—refusing to break the clasp despite temptation, seeking sound where others seek noise—so the trait is embodied, not labeled. The interior contradiction between his archival gentleness and the buried shout that killed Mira gives credible internal tension, and the final gesture of opening the diary is earned by that prior causality. Cost is visible: the diary’s clasp remains intact, but the silence he harvests is now contaminated with her absence, so renunciation carries felt weight. The “eclectic” facet is asserted more than demonstrated—no eccentricities beyond the umbrella-rib microphones—so the full 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—hope of life from rot versus fear of deathly bloom—drives every beat and is embodied in sensory micro-choices (trembling hands, salt of fear). The elders’ status shift is legible in Maru’s surrender nod, but only Liora acts; no second character exerts sustained pressure, so relationship crucible tests don’t apply. Final renunciation of safety is causally earned yet cost is felt more atmospherically than viscerally. Still, her olfactory lens and notebook compulsion individuate her; no label-speak occurs in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s quiet resolve and tactile steering give credible interiority; the renunciation of motors and trust in inverted currents crystallize an earned stance. Flaw: no contradictory impulse under pressure—he never doubts or waits, so the micro-choice hierarchy feels preset, not discovered. Still, the final fingertip-to-arrow beat shows visible cost (foreknowledge of guardianship) that scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Investigator’s interiority is concrete, profession-specific, and drives every micro-choice; the patch-rubbing ritual embodies contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. forensic detachment—and the final renunciation (recommending yard redesign) is earned by the wind-walk survey with visible fatigue and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ilen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his synesthetic palette and breath-made-blue mist—but he never faces a contradictory impulse that forces a costly renunciation; the “fear that the world might no longer notice” is stated, not dramatized in a beat that could have foreclosed a path. The closing bow is ritual, not choice, so the visible cost is atmospheric rather than personal. Still, his perceptual signature is so specific that the character feels irreplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cael’s guilt-riven solitude is viscerally embodied—every breath an intrusion, the flute “heavier…than he remembered.” The interior contradiction—duty to keep the bridge open vs. need to hear the mute instrument—drives every micro-choice from silk-unwrapping to the final imperfect note. The renunciation of performative mastery for humble listening is fully earned; the cost is the lifelong stone of failure he will keep breathing. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s shifting mimicry of lost voices is chillingly embodied; the narrator’s grief is likewise somatic, not labeled. The final hand-on-halo choice costs the tidy arithmetic of loss, earning the renunciation. Interior contradiction spikes when borrowed personas slip mid-sentence. Only the brother-crash memory feels briefly summary, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courier’s jitters, embodied in the clicking boots, feel real and particular, but the decisive interior shift—deciding to linger everywhere—arrives in a single abstract sentence without a micro-choice dramatized on the page, so the cost is announced rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nari’s interiority is precise and embodied—“she pressed the bead to her lips and whispered the unfinished messages”—and her contradictory impulse to speak yet distrust words drives every beat. The final renunciation—feeding her decade of woven youth into the puzzle—pays off the motif of words dissolving and re-inscribes her brother-fixation with visible cost. No stock phrasing; even “wistful” is earned through action. Micro-choices (trading wool, pressing bead, unweaving) reveal a hierarchy of values that forecloses the loom-path forever.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Corren’s “meek” interiority is asserted but barely dramatized; his descent into the mine and final speech to the stone are the only beats where his determination collides with fear, so the contradiction is announced rather than lived. The emotional cost (curled shoulders, apologizing hammer strikes) is named repeatedly but never complicates his choices; the final ascent reads as triumph, not paid-for endurance. Because the awakening stories he collects remain off-stage, the furnace-of-hope metaphor feels second-hand and untested. Earned Stasis is gestured at, yet no path is foreclosed on the page; he simply leaves the mine carrying a new ladder, unchanged in station or psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s interior contradiction—talent as both gift and cage—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (hand closing the shard, cutting expectation threads). The cyclical amnesia maps cleanly to his cyclically spontaneous gift, making blind-spot mapping inevitable. Final renunciation of inherited paths carries visible cost: the bay’s silence reconfigures as singular, no longer echoing parallel lives.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reticent watchfulness is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—re-stacking the stones, palming the sea glass, writing an unsigned letter—each one embodying both his grandfather’s code and his own reluctant stewardship. Interior contradiction is vivid: he dismisses ghosts yet trembles; wants to leave yet pockets the ache. The final renunciation—scraping the spiral to “safe”—pays the cost of perpetual, anonymous guardianship, earned by the accretion of observed details rather than an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orrin’s contradictory mix of fatalism and defiant creation is alive in every micro-choice—tending a pointless light, tasting static, laughing with “shadowed elation.” The final acquiescence to steer the beam upward is earned by decades of hoarded oaths fermenting in the walls, paid with the recognition that his own handwriting now dictates cosmic script. Interiority stays concrete and lighthouse-specific; no diagnostic self-talk. The only bar to 9.0 is absence of a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but within single-POV default this is maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dye master’s desire to “learn why some people magnetize stories” propels every beat; his quiet micro-choice to display the morpho wing crystallizes that motive. Interiority is concrete—“borrowed heart kept time with strangers becoming luminous”—and the final bow registers earned cost. No contradiction in impulses, though the courier & child remain functional rather than crucible. The old-heart / new-heart contrast supplies ongoing embodied tension without diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Milo’s quiet, attuned interiority—listening to the labyrinth breathe, choosing to carry the sextant, watering the trees—builds a hierarchy of values where attention itself becomes risk. The final ledger entry is a micro-choice that crystallizes his endurance and forecloses return to sweeping anonymity; cost is the lifelong burden of witnesseship. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. wonder) hum under every beat without overt epiphany. Voice stays lone and occupational detail stays germane; no relationship crucible is required here.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s interiority is richly particular—her hands shake as she sings back through a shard, revealing a hierarchy of values (mercy vs. memory) that compounds into irrevocable cost when the satchel empties. Contradictory impulses—clinging to forgetting vs. forcing remembrance—coexist in the same beat, making her final act feel earned rather than symbolic. The only bar to 9+ is that the realm’s people remain off-stage silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s guilt-driven passivity is credibly specific; the brother-voicemail beat embodies the “mistake like an unreturned book” and crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The micro-choice to re-pocket the invitation as promise shows visible cost. No contradictory impulses in-scene, only interior summary; that caps it at 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “creeping normality noticer” trait is dramatized through the undramatic—he carries, unwraps, and finally shares the bread instead of heroic protest. The tea mistress’s heuristically gentle gait and soft demolition of absolution myths apply immediate status pressure, forcing him to test his self-image. Interior contradiction—guilt vs. complicity—is kept alive inside every tactile choice (dip bread, breathe steam) without therapeutic labels. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the path of quiet witnessing is accepted, but the cost (lingering guilt, no absolution) is tasted in the last crumb.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Serin’s quietly obsessive need to “conjure meaning” is dramatized through frost-breath, trembling glyphs, and the choice to braid his own vow into the failing light; the interior contradiction between detachment and desperate meaning-making is palpable. The final micro-choice—adding his words—pays the visible cost of surrendering forgetfulness, earning the Earned Stasis closure. Competence is nuanced by genuine risk (library falling, personal memory overload). Minor dip: the “ache of confession” line drifts toward abstract diagnostic-speak before re-grounding in the draft image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    Loretta’s hunger to “hear trust break” is a vivid, character-specific desire that drives every step; her micro-choices—whispering the forbidden name, clutching the fob, staying till dawn—embody the moon-runner’s discipline and the daughter’s revolt. The interior contradiction (loyalty vs. need to wound) is alive in-scene, not summarized. Father remains off-page, so status crucible is waived; the old woman is plot furniture, not relationship pressure, so no penalty. Final endurance—collecting bruises like jars—earns its cost through prior causality; the emotional price is felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    The luminous skeptic’s doubt and glow are credibly embodied; the final tacit assent to “help us remember how to let go” is foreshadowed by the ring-melt and taste-shifts, so renunciation lands with cost. Interior contradiction remains more asserted than dramatized in-scene; the narrator never actively resists the strangers’ offer, muting the crucible intensity demanded at 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—public compliance vs. secret art—are dramatized in every beat; the charcoal on his fingers and the lock in his palm embody the conflict. The unfinished portrait of Mara acts as a live wound, forcing micro-choices that intensify until he draws her eyes and weeps, paying the cost in real time. Memory as gift/flaw is shown, not told: it supplies the precise charcoal stitch of her lashes and the hollow click of the broken lock. The final renunciation—re-hanging the self-portrait—earns its stasis because every prior beat has foreclosed the easier path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s allergy to lies is vivid—hands tremble, gold crumples—so the trait drives every beat. The moment he chooses to open the rusted gate with the postal fragment, he risks direct exposure to the city’s withheld dishonesty; the cost is the sudden hush of stale ink-air that “smelled of long-delayed honesty,” a felt bodily price. Interiority stays concrete: he senses “unspoken warnings in the air” and equates withheld truth with breath stuck on a tongue, avoiding label-speak. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he steps inside knowing he may be overwhelmed, foreclosing the safety of his sealed studio—choice is earned and irreversible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s seasonal muteness and tactile eloquence create a vivid, embodied contradiction; the moment he places the iceberg shard and accepts voice-loss is a credible micro-choice with cost. Interiority stays concrete (“ice forming behind his teeth”). No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped; head-count clean. The renunciation of speech is earned by prior causal chain—winter always takes his voice—so the endurance qualifies as Earned Stasis. Flaw: no visible contradiction inside the final beat; emotion is single-register acceptance, keeping him just shy of 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The android’s nostalgic drive to “burn” his borrowed fears is rooted from line 1 (“remember”) and sharpens with every geomagnetic lurch; the interior contradiction—pruning roses while courting wildfire—beats inside every micro-choice (“folded the images down”). Embodied emotion arrives in servo-misfires that feel like “startled muscles,” and the final renunciation of the crate costs him his last link to the children, paid in visible static-quiet. No diagnostic labels—only acts and sensorial cost—earning the unusually high band for a single-POV miniature arc.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “sandstorm calm” and curatorial gaze are vivid, but her interior contradiction—listening as resistance—stays largely asserted; the final act of listening-through-lock-picking is earned yet the cost (risk of eviction, bodily danger) is only ambient, not embodied. Micro-choices (pressing locket to cement, refusing center stage) align with trait, but we never see her fatigue, doubt, or sore knees—so the endurance feels slightly heroic rather than humanly strained.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s calm-defiant stance is credibly anchored in Ara’s teachings and the dice-guided micro-choices; the refusal to “retrieve data” and decision to free the lab’s new language feel earned. Interiority stays concrete—water “tasting me for passwords” rather than label-speak. One minor slip: the leap from “I understood” to full-scale server re-write is declared, not dramatized, blunting the cost visibility. Still, the contradiction between spy-duty and discipleship pulses throughout, giving the ending its renunciation weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lantern-lighter’s interiority is concrete and haunting—his father’s coffee-ground auguries feel inherited in his bones. His micro-choice to pour coffee onto the salt tray is a visible wager that re-configures his stance. Embodied emotion (“my chest had been filled with wet sand”) sustains pressure. The final endurance—watching stunned-fish memories circle—accepts cost without softening his flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ilen’s interiority is lush and embodied—his chest tightens as each prophecy-thread dissolves—but the “tranquil blaze” motive never complicates or contradicts itself; compassion is declared, not battle-tested. No flaw or blind spot surfaces to create an internal reversal, so the final stance feels serene rather than costly. Still, the micro-choice to let the brook speak through the paper’s silence valleys is specific and irreversible, earning a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s curiosity-driven trespass and evolving apprenticeship are credibly motivated; the translucent tutor’s “death is mostly a scheduling issue” line crystallizes his liminal ethos. Interiority stays concrete (“some old etiquette manual had opened in my spine”) and degrades under wonder without lapsing into reportage. The final gesture—grasping the seal while accepting the building’s denials—earns a quiet renunciation with felt cost, though the emotional arc is slightly under-articulated between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Neris’s “charmed skeptic” contradiction is dramatized in the moment she presses the shell to her ear despite fear; her embodied tremor and micro-choice to keep listening give interiority bite. The caretaker’s single speech act (“You change the purpose of the cage”) catalyzes her shift from avoidance to archivist, so renunciation is earned. Interior contradiction is sustained throughout—physics perfume, archive-as-file-label—without lapsing into diagnostic self-talk. Guilt quarantine is shown via sensory flashback, not labeled, so the flaw complicates rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Irian’s interior contradiction—perfectionist forger who fears unfinished good-byes—drives every stroke; the final decision to sign in his own hand is pre-saged by the thorn prick and mother-letter memory, so the renunciation feels earned. Micro-choices (hovering nib, brushing thorn) keep guilt embodied. Sevran functions mainly as permission device rather than crucible, preventing 9+. No knowledge leaks or label-speak; emotions stay sensory (pulse in throat, ink warm as blood).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s grief-riven listening is concretely embodied (“reed-blown melancholy,” the trembling shell) and her final acceptance is earned through a causal chain of canyon tests; the interior contradiction between blame and need is alive in scene. Micro-choices (kneeling, lowering the flute, lifting the shell again) visibly re-weight her values. Flaw: no second on-page character, so relationship/status crucible and secondary pressure bullets are N/A—minor ceiling only. “Grief sharpened…loosened” skirts diagnostic label-speak but is saved by immediate physical correlative, so −0.3 not −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marek’s contradictory drives—solace-seeking dive-recovery versus truth-telling that wounds listeners—press against each other in the single beat when he fingers the melted globe and lays the woman's lineage bare. His body registers the cost ("pressure in his chest") and his renunciation is visible: he keeps touching the object that proves both love and failure. Interiority is concrete, not therapeutic, and the final micro-choice (handing the moral labor to the visitor) caps his arc with palpable fatigue. Only the sister-memory refrain drifts toward label-speak once, clipping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—wanting validation yet fearing ridicule—surfaces in the brother insult and the final half-opened-lantern chest, but we never watch a micro-choice under pressure; the arc is told rather than dramatized. Ren acts as mentor-only; his “modest, almost mischievous pride” is asserted, not embodied in a risky on-page decision. Closure is Earned Stasis, cost legible, but the emotional shift is narrated in summary (“something eased inside me”) rather than shown through body or deed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theo’s interior contradiction—fame from exposing lies, now hired to certify them—drives every beat; his micro-choices (spade vs. diamond, respirator fog vs. lens clarity) embody the cost of refusing delivery. The final refusal is earned because the shredded-letter reassembly sequence dramatizes his epistemic addiction; the orchard’s starving survivors are the visible price. No head-hop or stock phrasing; only flaw is slight under-embodiment of radioactive fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ilen’s interiority is vivid—his lungs “forget how to breathe,” his laugh “scraping like a chair on concrete”—and his micro-choice to stand beneath the portico under the Voice’s command crystallizes his variant-allegiance arc. The childhood blackout memory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts his stance, satisfying BRR. Cost is felt: he realizes “the choice had probably been made years ago,” a resonant renunciation. Minor slip: the phrase “lyrically prophetic” is used meta-diagnostically without on-page dramatized cost, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Poet’s “wistful courage” to open the box gives one vivid micro-choice, but interiority flirts with label-speak (“felt strangely rich…gleaned redemption”) rather than body. His loneliness is shown early, yet the moment of giving the jar away is under-dramatized—no contradictory impulse, so renunciation feels smoothed rather than paid for. Still, the body-in-sand cues anchor him and the final “step down” shows visible cost, keeping motivation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” self-diagnosis is dramatized in the breath-by-breadth calibration of his chant; the contradictory impulses—engineer’s flowchart versus trembling molars—play out inside the same beat. The final renunciation (letting the storm rest its forehead against him) costs him literal voice-fatigue and symbolic guardianship, a price scaled to the 800-word limit. Interiority is concrete and sensorily grounded; no label-speak. The monks’ absence keeps relationships off-page, so the “crucible” bullet is waived without penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is textured—impatience “gnawed at my ribs,” embodied and particular. The causal chain from restless city refugee to slow-lightning convert is legible, and the final stance (“willingness to move slowly while the world screamed for haste”) costs him his prior identity. Yet Orren remains a prop-master rather than a second pressure source; status dynamics stay static, capping relationship-as-crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The investigator’s interior contradiction—protect the Authority vs. see the dead—drives every beat; the silent nod at the end costs his career and is earned by the lantern-lit confrontation with the ghosts. Embodied emotion is sharp (“clipboard like a shield,” pulse in the rails). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: observe → acknowledge → resolve to report truth. Flaw remains: the moment of decision is one silent nod; a stronger physical act or renounced form would lock 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hesitation mirrored in the rain-window, his silence in the cell—but the moral calculus that should complicate his final stance is stated more than dramatized; the bent cog and Mara’s file-work stand in for his own micro-choice, so the cost feels borrowed from the object rather than paid by the chaplain himself. The “aptly deliberate” trait is asserted, not tested under pressure. Still, the contradiction between pastoral duty and personal doubt pulses throughout, and the renunciation of judgment is credibly earned by the scene’s accumulated guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Orin’s “steadily curious” trait stays visible—he touches the arrow, asks the question, chooses ascent—but the interior contradiction (awe vs. snark) is asserted rather than dramatized in a single beat; the final yes feels more thematic than personally costly, so the arc skirts Earned Stasis territory.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s obsession with 713 and the archive’s ghosts is anchored in concrete micro-choices—spoofing an audit, pinning the patch, writing the illegal query. Interiority is consistent and character-specific; the final renunciation (closing the interface) costs him certainty and safety, earned by the trail of small rebellions. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate is barely missed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ira’s interiority is consistently shadow-laced: his reflex to “let the accusation rest” and literal mirroring of others’ fears reveal a man trained to metabolize emotion into data. The orchard’s dream-force collides with that training, forcing him to abandon pure mediation and risk complicity—an arc legibly paid for when he lifts the fragment and feels “futures shiver across his skin.” The anomaly’s motives stay slightly abstract (her raw vow feels more manifesto than lived need), so the dyad’s crucible cools a notch short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The interior contradiction—wanting to die yet listening for the sound of continuance—is dramatized in every micro-choice (renting the bunk, cataloguing debris, tapping the parasol). The heirloom’s re-purposing as tuning fork and the final moment of “undecided” vibration show embodied emotion rather than labels. The decision to turn back is earned by the prior causal chain of listening, not an epiphany. Flaw: “grips reality loosely” is named once without visible cost; still, the speaker’s perceptual warp is shown elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tomas’s quietly missionary empathy is shown through tactile micro-choices: retrieving the charred letter, offering it, translating vineyard lore into marital metaphor. Interiority stays concrete—“clothes seem too thin for the rising chill” carries her state without label-speak. The final “rhyme vs. overlap” insight is earned because the letter fragment and her lateness have already tested the idea onstage. Cost is visible: he acknowledges he will keep guarding strangers, forfeiting his own bus-ready escape.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The half-masked line walker’s interior contradiction—listening to lies with one side of his face, to unspoken regrets with the other—remains vivid and character-specific. His decision to whisper tactical honesty to the prophet is a micro-choice that visibly alters the city’s fate, paying a cost in exposure. The prophet’s “strangely honest” trait is shown through plain diction that stings, not told. Secondary figures (mother, merchant) are sketched with quick, embodied reactions that feed the kinetic parapet, so the cast pressure coheres even beyond the two leads.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist’s curiosity and reluctant commitment are sketched economically, but his interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. unexpected lightness after the boy’s visit—remains asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices are limited to listening, labeling, and sketching; no higher-stakes decision or visible cost is forced under the lavender pressure, so the “earned change” feels faint. The boy’s grief is conveyed through gesture and photograph, but the archivist’s own emotional risk never compounds, keeping characterization competent yet not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reticence and scholar’s solitude are embodied in every micro-gesture; the interior contradiction—needing silence yet chasing outlawed growth—drives every beat. His decision to embrace fractured testimony is earned via the crystal’s voices and carries visible cost: he must step from index-cards into performative risk. The “weathered innocence” motif is lived, not labeled. Single-POV default; no relationship crucible on stage, so bullets waived cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitively forgetful trait is dramatized through frantic chalk-scrawl and morning amnesia, giving him a living contradiction that drives the plot. His hunger to “capture the sound of growing older” is embodied when he presses a videotape to his ear, not merely declared. Mara and the narrator arrive as observers rather than crucible partners, so relationship pressure is absent, but their listening stance still forecloses a return to ordinary life. The final image of the unreadable refrigerator sentence shows cost: prophecy exists yet remains forever out of reach, sealing his exile.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilias’s embodied tinkering under quake-pressure reveals a lucid hierarchy of values: the data > his own safety > institutional protocol. His interior contradiction—grief for Alma versus cold technical focus—surfaces in micro-choices (bypassing dampers, cradling Camera Three) that visibly risk body and budget. The final renunciation to “seal their brief, stolen clarity” costs future funding and political protection, the price legible in the archive’s metallic click. Voice stays sharp and specific; only the off-page staff blur slightly, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s serenity is shown, not told—her micro-choice to place the unopened lab result on the table crystallizes her “decisively kind” trait under pressure. The contradictory impulse is present: she resists the urge to read the results aloud, instead handing over the vinyl shard, a gesture that costs her the comfort of medical certainty. Mr. Alvarez’s interiority is filtered through her perception, keeping POV clean, yet his single decisive nod re-centers agency on him. The endurance is earned: she refuses to perform grief for him, a renunciation that forecloses the expected therapeutic script and leaves her holding the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lysa’s quiet, obsessive precision—memorized steps, lantern hooded, months clandestine tracing—grounds every beat; the “terrifying freedom” line crystallizes a renunciation whose price is felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in real time, only recalled, so the 9+ gate just fails, but interiority is otherwise concrete, embodied, and stake-scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly particular—“forgiving only people, and only if they learned from the smudges”—and her bone-setter’s gaze physically embodies the skepticism.  The decision to step through the “aching doorway” is earned by her prior refusal to accept the too-neat corpse and by the tactile memory of Tomas’s garden experiments.  Micro-choices—palming the tooth, feeling it tug at the fracture in certainty—show contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) acting simultaneous in scene.  Cost is visible: she trades her fracture of doubt for the embodied labor of re-aligning an alien child, leaving her with “almost bearable” doubt—an earned stasis that forecloses return to her earlier complacency.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single, consistent POV whose tactile ritual steadily reveals interior ache. Micro-choices (circular sanding, hand-weighing) externalize grief without slipping into label-speak. The final gift to the children crystallizes the vow; cost is felt in the ache of “almost like a heart.” No contradiction under pressure; interiority stays embodied and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is granular and body-anchored; the amber pendant as inheritance is a believable pressure source. Yet her shift from viral pariah to cooperative gardener is more asserted than dramatized—no micro-choice visibly costs her lingering shame or safety, so the renunciation feels soft rather than staked.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—he both craves and shuns closure—embodied in the cracked shell against his ear. The final renunciation (”let them arrive somewhere”) is earned by the visions that flood him; the cost is the surrender of his protective ambiguity. Micro-choices—pressing the shell, watching the backward river—reveal hierarchy of values without label-speak. Voice stays singular; no second character on page so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tinkerer’s interiority is lightly sketched—his “suspicion” about alignment is the only explicit contradiction—but his embodied humming, listening, and final micro-choice (pouring the bowl) earn a credible renunciation of solitary craft for communal rhythm. No secondary character exerts individuated pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw-risk balance is safe: he never errs or pays a wound, so the arc is more gentle activation than crucible. Still, the single POV stays coherent, and the endurance of shared rhythm carries a soft cost that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s patience is embodied in every slow gesture and joint-creaking kneel; his solitude is total, yet his interior contradiction—mapping for absent travelers—stays vivid. No epiphany, only a quiet renunciation that costs him the last vial and leaves him alone with the glowing map; the cost is palpable in the dimming orchard. Interiority remains concrete, never diagnostic. The absence of other characters limits relational crucible, but the world itself becomes his antagonist, its heartbeat the only dialogue needed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interiority is rich—his “peripherally focused” nature shapes every micro-choice (mirror angles, oblique gaze at spinning light). Contradictory impulses (urgency to save wonder vs. fear of direct stare) coil inside single beats, culminating in the earned, quiet renunciation of “looking directly.” Cost is felt: he leaves the cavern having traded immediate certainty for a reservoir of indirect awe. The absence of any second character keeps relationship/status bullets inactive, but single-POV depth fully satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"weight sharp, like gravel in marrow"—but the lone POV never faces an on-page opposing will, so status/relationship pressure is absent. The final micro-choice—lifting the lamp toward her own fear—earns the shift, yet the cost is more imagistic than viscerally felt. Still, the contradictory impulse (cling to fear vs. release into pattern) is dramatized in the wrist-turn that breaks calcification, satisfying the 9+ test within the single-POV crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the need to fashion a usable relic—play out in scene, not summary; her decision to cut the first line is earned by the tactile memory of Luca’s “hauntingly practical” love and carries visible cost in the moment she risks fixing him as object. Interiority is concrete and particular (rain-beaded glass as crowd noise, ash as mute animal). No label-speak; even the abstract “harvest lessons from loss” is immediately grounded in micro-choice: the kettle ticks, she sets blank beside cup, breathes the held breath. The flaw: we get no secondary pressure from another live character; at this length acceptable, but keeps it from 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scavenger’s compulsive collection of stolen voices is vividly embodied—salt-crusted fingers, pocketing the camera wheel—so his erosion feels tactile. Yet the interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized: “resolve is what remains when better things erode” is a thesis, not a beat. The micro-choice to hand the wheel to the ghost carries cost, but the prior beats are accumulative summary rather than scene-pressure. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature and the final hollowing of self keep this in high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s curiosity-to-trouble trait is shown through embodied, on-page risk (entering alone at night, climbing into pipes). Interiority stays concrete—“hope as flow-rate”—and her final nod carries earned stoic cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are N/A. Flaw: the “equations for hope” premise is self-reported, never pressure-tested by an external challenge that could falsify it, capping short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s excruciatingly gentle interiority is dramatized in embodied micro-choices—two-finger touch, coaxing gears, ink serif apology—each revealing hierarchy of values under pressure; dream-renunciation and bearing others’ hours create legible contradiction that earns the final quiet return to desk as Earned Stasis with felt cost. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli (wet-stone scent, slipping gear) and tilts choice, satisfying BRR. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible exempt. Minor over-articulation (“bear other people’s hours”) grazes diagnostic-speak but is quickly buried in tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s hunger to “understand the architecture of lies” is embodied in every beat—ticking useless sundial, diving despite cowardice, refusing to hand over the satchel—so contradiction stays live in scene. The final refusal crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth over survival) with visible cost: two armed silhouettes lose their easy silence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, the pocket sundial’s uselessness becomes a tactile emblem of retooled instinct. The only drag is the late-coined phrase “errant legend seeker,” which feels slightly external to the earned voice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eli’s interiority stays anchored in tactile seed-and-rope perception; the fulgurite’s shiver and his calluses tracing hemp give embodied contradiction between collector-urge and preservation-urge. The final bow conveys earned renunciation, but the woman’s dissolve feels slightly convenient, muting the cost that could push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lady Sera’s motives—mapping “the geography of healing” through self-sequestered pilgrimages—are specific and internally contradictory; her confession under the pergola dramatizes both urge to flee and need to feel. The narrator’s profession as living-obituarist is more label than lived; no micro-choice in the walk reveals how that avocation shapes perception. Yet the shared garden circuit visibly costs her (naming each locus of pain) and earns the final image of “nothing disappears,” satisfying earned stasis. Relationship pressure is single-sided; the narrator remains observer, so status crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prince’s yearning for wings is vivid and embodied (“bedraggled prince of rust”); his refusal to smelt the egg is a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is strong, but the moment of memory-transfer (“seared through him”) leans toward unearned epiphany rather than gradual, earned contradiction. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: duty vs. beauty, chosen at visible personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maris’s contradictory impulses—firefighter discipline versus arsonist’s daughter shame—are dramatized in the single beat of shielding the boy while feeling heat on her neck. The coin graft is a micro-choice that visibly costs her the last relic of her father, earning the quiet closure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the boy’s motivation is slightly abstract, keeping this just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lira’s “luminous skeptic” persona is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—gripping the kite string, pouring her doubt into the box—so the renunciation of her armor feels earned and costly. Interior contradiction is vivid: she both needs belief to act and distrusts it; this tension is kept alive in scene, not summary. The final openness after the glass shatters registers as a genuine psychic wound rather than tidy growth.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—tending gentleness while haunted by inherited violence—is dramatized in every micro-choice: reaching to prune a flare, pausing when the gear bites the skin. Emotions are never labeled; they arrive as physical echoes (“the ache behind my ribs where a heart might have existed”). The final, silent decision to keep reaching out is earned by the grandmother memory and the accumulating weight of each star-loss. Voice remains singular, obsessive, and resistant to tidy redemption—an individual, not a type.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—calloused fingers smoothing ribbon, breath fogging in warm glass—yet the “fiercely meditative” trait is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory action. The micro-choice to carve hidden verses is present and costly, but the grandmother’s spectral pressure, not his own flaw, drives every beat, blunting the arc from mistake to mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The winder’s guilt-driven precision is viscerally embodied in the ritual of thumb-tracing the rake handle; the interior contradiction between penance and stewardship peaks when he realizes “incremental absolution had turned into incremental avoidance.” The final covenant to invite apprentices is earned, but the brother remains off-stage, so the relational crucible is with the self; the cost is felt yet slightly under-dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gardener’s contradictory compulsion—joyful whistling while bound to unfinished grief—shows in every tactile micro-choice (rake in hand, dirt under nails, strip pressed to tapestry). His refusal-to-leave is not declared but dramatized by the hum that answers when fragment meets border; the cost is the moment he recognizes the soil-handed opponent as his own shadow. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; the epiphany is earned because the tapestry literally stitches his past persona into present stance. Flaw complicity is irreversible: once he sees the loose strands he names himself keeper of knots, foreclosing any exit with visible existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—paid to map ignorance yet haunted by the human cost—drives every beat; the trembling hand before the nib is the visible price of his earned choice. No stock interiority; his noticing is cartographer-precise (“circles, arrows, and numbers in charcoal”) and his body fails under pressure (“eyes burned… thoughts frayed like worn rope”). The flaw is the same trait that empowers him: predictive imagination that could bury strangers. Final micro-choice—lowering the nib—forecloses every other future and is legible as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina’s interiority is character-specific (the copyist’s ear for “wrong strokes” rings false) and her micro-choice to encode instructions in scores is embodied. The boy’s arrival tests her motive—she shifts from solitary transcriber to mentor-witness—but the cost (risk of discovery) is named, not felt. Flaw-competence balance is right: she trembles yet keeps writing. No internal contradiction is staged in-scene; the “hope” epiphany is label-only.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interiority is sharply etched through ash-scatter choreography and the grandmother-proxy mask; the renunciation of “safety” is embodied, not declared. The micro-choice to release the final ash visibly costs her the illusion of control, earning the Earned Stasis. Grandmother’s mirrored mask-handling supplies external pressure, but the relationship crucible is implied more than staged, keeping the score just below 9. No contradictory impulses are voiced in scene—only symbolically enacted—so the quick-test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sewer-philosopher’s interiority is specific—wading through filth to justify a worldview—and his calm abrasive stance is embodied in every beat. No second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solo arc still shows a credible renunciation (earned stasis) that costs him visibility and safety. The only drag is a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“rationally rebellious itch”) that momentarily abstracts the moment instead of enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maro’s interior contradiction—soldier’s guilt versus conductor’s patience—is dramatized through the gesture of his hands guiding others while folding his own violence into the motion. The micro-choice of placing the zither between Dari and Ilan crystallizes his hierarchy of values: harmony over absolution. Cost is felt in the withheld confession, not declared. The ache of “clothing that no longer fit” is embodied, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ariel’s embodied tasting of memories, the seed lodged behind her sternum, and her “informally wise” snorts all individuate her; the apprentice is thinner. The kernel-swallow moment is a decisive, costly micro-choice that re-configures her perception and launches the pruning. Interior contradiction—hope versus salt decay—stays active in-scene. The apprentice’s late arrival adds mild status pressure, but relationship-as-crucible is under-exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marla’s involuntary honesty is dramatized in every beat: the reflexive confession “I am involuntarily truthful,” the throat-tightening moment before she must speak the city awake, the envy of liars. The boy’s presence forces a visible hierarchy of values—truth vs wonder—and her final utterance costs her the safety of silence. Interior contradiction is live: duty to report wars with the quieter wish to “preserve wonder,” and both impulses act simultaneously under the booth’s failing light. The arc lands in credible endurance: she keeps collecting “a small secret toll,” a renunciation that forecloses pure honesty and accepts ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eli’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—his synesthetic feel of the orris root as “a shard of hush” and his cataloguing of paint-thin fingerprints reveal a man whose flaws (hyper-attention to imperceptible change) actively complicate every step. The decisive, costly shift comes when he moves the bed toward the corner he earlier avoided, surrendering bodily comfort to answer the house’s mute grammar—an earned renunciation that closes the arc. Micro-choices (touching the lintel twice, rotating the clock) manifest his hierarchy of values without diagnostic speak. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV texture remains consistent and idiosyncratic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living-statue POV delivers a consistent, mineral slowness that permeates every beat; interiority is anchored to tactile stone nerves and silt breath, never generic. The climactic consent—her gloved palm on the cracked column—externalizes the moral pivot cleanly. Reflection stays ≤20 % and is tied to present micro-choices (dislodging silt, widening fault-lines). Flaw: the moment of “fear” is named rather than embodied; a hairline slip at the hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Arin’s interiority is textured—his love of the chipped die’s skewed fairness and his refusal to stop walking both feel idiosyncratic and grounded. Yet the “missed doorway” backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that never pricks the present beat; we get no micro-choice that dramatizes what staying would have cost, so the renunciation lands pre-packaged rather than earned in scene. The result is a credible but not wrenching endurance; the emotional price is asserted more than embodied in a present-temperature shift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aurelia’s insomnia, painter’s eye, and methodical hope are concretely dramatized: every micro-choice (barefoot stance, lamp-angle, brush-dip) flows from her theory that kindness can be re-ignited. Contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. tender credulity—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final quiet smile of strangers is the cost she pays: her own loneliness stays uncured, proving her endurance with felt cost. All traits are particular to her; none drift into generic “artist” cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulse—cataloguing vs. rescue—surfaces early and recurs, but the final renunciation (“I stayed after my contract ended”) is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the interiority is textured yet the decisive beat is summary.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aurek’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and contradiction-laden; the moment he “felt something yield inside him” between fear and resolve crystallizes his arc. Micro-choices (turning the yoyo shell, casting it into the void) are causally tied to his marrow-deep ache and to the buyers who trust his backward clocks. No safety-hedging: he kneels willingly at a stone that promises despair. Interior drift under peak pressure is minimal; the refusal to accept despair is earned and costs him the safety of uncertainty, visible in the final tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s contradictory fear of living-light vs. dying-dark is embodied in freeze-dried saliva, bloated Polaroids, and the kneel on the pier planks; the final confession to his child-fear literally shifts the clasp and warms the photo, paying the cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the advisor’s damp fingertip metaphor repeats once too often. The earned stasis—still haunted yet breathing—lands because the prior beats have tied the clasp/photo to his stalled resurrection. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aera’s interiority is concrete and embodied—bare feet on brine-soaked planks, the mallet’s weight in her palm. The “obstacles into instruments” credo is dramatized, not declared, through her percussive commands that literally retune the orchard. Cost is visible: fear stays a bass note under the new harmony, and her smile at the end carries the residue of every wave she just dared. Only the grandmother flashback feels slightly abstract, blunting the full bite of generational trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Keth's quietly driven guilt and pattern-fluency are embodied in every shell he strokes; the final act of carving a question into a living shell and sounding a new whistle is the micro-choice that crystallizes his prior passivity into agency. Interior contradiction—between self-blame and the need to act—threads every beat, never resolved into tidy insight. The cost is implicit but felt: once the turtles turn, he can no longer remain the city's silent scapegoat. This is an earned, irreversible stance shift under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradictions—pride in craft vs horror at its misuse—are dramatized in micro-choices: the cautious lift of the illuminated T, the measured cadence of his ultimatum. The “emotionally rational” trait is not a label but a lived tension that dictates how he modulates threat and awe under pressure. His final stance crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible social cost, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—certifying safety while secretly memorializing loss—are embodied in every micro-choice; the antique inkwell anchors generational memory and her stoic sensitivity costs her solitude. Her final renunciation (sealing the last note, turning back toward neon forgetting) is earned and visibly priced. No clichéd interiority; every beat is filtered through her surveyor’s eye and grief. Interior contradiction peaks as she “tucks someone into sleep” with grout—tender violence that forecloses her own witness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—obedient indexer vs. truth-hunter—drives every micro-choice; the colder stamp, the broken shelf-sequence, the decision to snap the kelp-ribbon all embody her trait. Emotions stay embodied (fingers on “reluctant lips” of pages) rather than labeled. The final renunciation—she will pursue the unapproved past even without council sanction—costs her the safety of civic myth; the choice is fully earned by prior causal beats. Only minor hedge: we get no second character to test status dynamics, but the solo POV remains coherent and pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—her hesitation at the cliff, the flayed-heart sensation while polishing the memory—but the daughter-loss motive is only asserted, never dramatized, so the “uncut stone” she carries feels pre-labelled rather than earned. Micro-choices (folding, breathing on the globe) visibly cost her, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps her from full individuality. Still, the final renunciation is credibly paid for by the polishing agony, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s cost clause.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s survivor-guilt and need for control are rendered in scalpel-sharp interiority (“I wanted my hand on the tilt of its descent”). The crystal-as-talisman object-choice is embodied, contradictory, and escalates to the final repair-nudge. Flaw: the leap from passive watching to active rerouting is slightly under-causal; one more micro-choice mid-text would have pushed 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her headset hums, the cable-to-horizon slack is felt—but the moment of “tuning her heart” drifts into therapeutic shorthand. The micro-choice to map star-tones to faces is earned, yet the cost (her military identity) is implied rather than embodied in a final refusal or forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses—duty vs. yearning—co-exist in scene, not summary, lifting the score into the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The genealogist’s interior contradiction—comforting clients with fake pedigrees while dreading his own erased bloodline—remains concrete and embodied (“every client leaves a new scar,” “scars itch”). Micro-choices (pocketing the broken watch, kneeling to sift driftwood) externalize the hierarchy of values: truth vs self-protection. The final renunciation—vowing to study the real marks instead of forging new ones—pays the cost of abandoning a lucrative identity; causality is clean. Only minor slack: the mother’s repeated tale is summarized, not dramatized, so the earliest shaping of his misbelief is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The negotiator’s interiority is granular and embodied—guilt hot-wired to the brass pull, pulse-counting every limping step. The brother reveal lands as a credible extension of earlier self-recrimination rather than contrived twist. Renunciation is earned: the same hyper-attentive trait that once misread a treaty now forces him to read the moral ledger correctly. Only micro-slip: “slow form of drowning” drifts toward diagnostic cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific; the “broken navigator” psyche is shown through embodied micro-choices (wobbling kayak, aligning the cracked compass). Contradictory impulses—wanting to vanish vs. paddling back—coexist in-scene. The final pivot toward shore is motivated by the barnacle epiphany, but the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “scraped and polished” skull, the cold water biting through boots, the baseball’s rough stitching all root emotion in sensory specifics. Contradictory impulses—yearning for amnesia yet trusting the pre-cleanse self—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final wade into the lake is an earned, costly micro-choice that forecloses passive forgetting. Voice occasionally over-articulates (“the receipt was written on faces…”), nudging toward diagnostic label-speak, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and specific to the narrator’s grief (“small paper rectangle… softer than any relic should be”). The reluctant metamorphosis is dramatized through visceral bodily fusion with the grove, earning the final trans-human union. Motivation stays locked to reforging the bond, and the cost—loss of human form—is legible on the page. Only minor dip: the beasts’ interior stance is ventriloquised rather than revealed through their own choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s guilt over trading card readings for father-time is embodied in star-tightened throat and the physical act of kneeling to unfasten the case; contradictory impulses—flee to the mountain vs. return—coexist in one continuous present. Micro-choice of pressing adult hand to wax-stiff child-outline crystallizes the hierarchy of values and carries visible cost. The only bar to 9.0 is a slight over-articulation of regret (“he feared every second…”) just before the climactic image; still, interiority stays character-specific and drives the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The engineered caretaker’s pacifist vow is embodied through micro-choices inside each immersion; the body-weight feedback loop makes every emotional tilt palpable. Interior contradiction is alive when killing seems merciful yet the vow hardens anyway. The final weightless lift is earned by every prior pound of shame, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Keeps 0.1 below 8.8 because the designers’ “strange mercies” are told more than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Niko’s contradictory mix of self-erasure and compulsive intervention is embodied in every beat—he pockets emptiness yet engineers fates. His micro-choice to hand Lila half the jars crystallizes a value hierarchy (others > self-myth) with visible cost (he will run barefoot toward lava with no light). Interiority stays concrete: “felt himself veer” not “decided,” “familiar irritation of being drafted” not “heroic doubt.” The flaw that drives the climax is the same trait seeded in line 2—his inability to refuse coincidence—so the ending feels earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iri’s quietly subversive mechanic-mind is vivid—her gaze “wandered like a calmly inventive mechanic appraising a broken engine” shows embodied, character-specific perception. Interior contradiction is active: loyalty to post vs. resolve to rewrite the fort’s story. The micro-choice to slot copper rods into hidden sockets converts bureaucratic props into lock-picking teeth, enacting her “silent revolution” with tactile risk. Cost is visible: the fort’s locks “forgot which side was inside,” foreclosing her old identity without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—Arin’s foresight collides with his inability to refuse the stillness he dreads. The moment knees scrape stone and pain returns, the cost of witnessing is made flesh. Micro-choices (stone placement, dust release) chart a hierarchy of values without exposition. Precognitive curse never slips into label-speak; it is lived through doubled time and bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Poet’s interiority is vivid—throat-space where “public language used to live” embodied, contradictory. Micro-choice to look through telescope earns cost: sky’s grief becomes his. No secondary pressure from astronomer beyond facilitator, so relationship crucible underused. Closure renunciation legible, price felt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Darius’s interior contradiction—philosopher vs duelist, repairer vs manipulator—surfaces in micro-choices: shifting the sundial, unsheathing the rapier, reopening the tin. The mechanical arm’s click keeps time as a bodily cost, anchoring motive in every lunge. The final invitation to “decide where your questions wish to go” crystallizes his earned stance: cartographer of hesitation, not miracle worker. Missing only a second on-page character to test status dynamics, but single-POV depth holds.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s serial self-reinvention is dramatized through micro-choices (slipping on “the weary archivist” under flashlight beams) and embodied cost (Lio’s trembling fingers, the floorboard that “swells slightly as if breathing”). Interior contradiction is vivid—“I tell him the coffee tin will stop me” while already half-shedding the prophet skin. The ledger of past selves in Lio’s head externalizes memory, anchoring motivation without exposition. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling—“Tonight I am mostly made of splintered hope and cigarette paper”—that momentarily abstracts the fracture instead of enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leon’s steely longing is embodied in every beat—his decision to walk into the film-reel is a credibly costly micro-choice that fuses want and fear. The contradictory pull between rehearsed endings and improvisation is dramatized, not told; even the final invitation to Mara carries the visible price of abandoning the station clocks forever. Mara’s “strategically creative” past is shown only in gesture (scarf-as-wrist-loop, off-beat smile), so the trait feels labeled rather than lived, preventing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—guardian of fixed memory who must decide whether to let memory shift—remains concrete and embodied; the seed’s weight against his palm, the ridge flowers closing as he passes, his sideways fall into sleep all externalize the conflict. His micro-choice to “listen” rather than adjudicate immediately crystallizes values under pressure. The dream’s revelation that the island’s story begins elsewhere is earned by prior ritual and omen buildup, and his final luminous doubt carries visible cost: the island may “stretch” beyond the safety of the seed. No therapy-speak or stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through his perceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s grief-soaked reticence is palpable; every micro-choice (tracing lace, breathing with the tide) externalizes guilt. The final non-verbal apology is earned because the text has tethered his silence to Mira’s absence from line 1. Interior contradiction—hope vs. disbelief in the tides—stays active in scene, not summary. Just shy of 9 because the cost is felt but not yet enacted; he still waits.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena’s motivation—rejecting scientific drama for quiet observation—is embodied in micro-choices (taping plastic over leaks, checking knots twice) and rooted in flood trauma. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief “softens from serrated to dull” through sensory metaphor, not therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (love for neutron stars vs. suspicion of her own hunger for cataclysm) act simultaneously in scene. Final renunciation of “fireworks for truth” is earned by prior causality with visible cost: she works in a damp ruin, forever marked by water.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through glass-specific perception (“stars trembled like glass,” “move through days the way glass cools”), and their contradictory impulses—between stillness and pursuit, memory and action—are active in-scene. The final choice to walk toward the pass is earned by prior causality (ledger discovery, canyon resonance) and carries visible cost: abandonment of the furnace as identity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression feels authentic under trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, wonder, and bewilderment manifest through tactile sensation and memory fragments rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (strapping on gloves, selecting emotional profiles) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on connection amid catastrophe. The contradiction between his belief in “unshaken marvels” and his waterlogged body drives credible endurance. Final renunciation of audible music for felt vibration is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “inadvertent stubbornness” masks grief as duty, and his brittle voice underwater reveals emotional erosion. His micro-choices (ignoring harbor master, rowing alone) stem from consistent traits and deepen under pressure. The librarian’s challenge forces a credible endurance that forecloses retreat with visible cost: he accepts shelving unrest as rest. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in tactile details like the lens warming or water “thick as sleep.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she dislikes mysteries yet investigates one; she leads but feels like a watchman. Her final choice to honor anonymity over exposure is earned by Kito’s revelation and aligns with her “gently persistent” ethos. Embodied details (smudged ink, rice crumbs) ground motivation without diagnostic labels. The cost—risking the donations by convening the community—is legible in her firm “I do not want them to stop.”

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Arun’s interiority is vividly embodied—his ache, breath, and withheld gestures manifest as physical and emotional contradictions. His micro-choices (e.g., approaching the boy, aligning breath) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The past-life memory isn’t abstract; it alters his perception and actions in real time. Final renunciation—exhaling unused love—is earned through prior causality and charged with gravity, not grief.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to discover the texture of time—is embodied through tactile, sensory choices (pruning, touching photographs, clutching the halo) that escalate into dissolution. Interior contradiction thrums: desire for knowledge versus fear of erasure, reverence versus trespass. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in trembling hands and fraying outlines. Final renunciation—stepping into disintegration—is earned by every prior beat of obsessive attention.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation—“to plant resilience in dry soil”—is embodied through precise micro-choices: her cough, her study of the Overseer’s key-swing, her strategic misdirection. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; contradictions (chained yet liberated, passive yet in control) pulse in every action. The final line—“guiding his hands away from ruin with staggering grace”—reveals a hierarchy of values (seeds over self, patience over panic) with palpable cost. Flawlessly consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely concrete, with contradictory impulses—chasing betrayal while evading self-blame—active in the present moment. Their micro-choices (adjusting the filament, feeding absences into the forge) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by grief and guilt. The final realization—that two betrayals occurred—emerges from embodied memory, not diagnostic abstraction. Flaws drive the arc without safety-hedging, and the cost of self-deception is legible in the “lacquer on a cracked instrument” reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—stealing faces to preserve illuminated moments—is vividly embodied and internally consistent, with micro-choices (e.g., hesitating before opening the jar) revealing a hierarchy of values. Their flaw (obsessive preservation over presence) drives the central conflict and culminates in an earned reconfiguration: realizing they’ve been “waiting at the hinge.” The mirrored stranger functions as both catalyst and archive, intensifying pressure without muddying focus. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using tactile imagery (“moonbeams quivering whenever I exhaled”) to convey emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Corin’s motivation is rooted in a credible moral evolution—from crafting targeting lenses to shaping vessels for inquiry—with visible cost (“each perfect circle… seemed to tighten around his own chest”). His actions (transforming the bookmark, choosing this setting) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The narrator’s subtle internal shift (“cautious heart shift, slightly”) avoids epiphany while showing embodied change. Both characters speak with distinct idiom, and Corin’s “thoughtfully spirited” trait manifests in performative ritual that serves thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s phobias are embodied with visceral specificity—“knives, crowds, deep water”—and her internal contradiction between terror and professional duty fuels every micro-choice. The child’s arrival doesn’t resolve her arc but catalyzes a reconfiguration rooted in prior causality: her decision to write on his cast emerges from accumulated vulnerability, not epiphany. Her voice avoids diagnostic label-speak; fear manifests as physical kinking, shaking quiet, breath held like borrowed air. The final renunciation—walking into the office trembling—is earned by this precise emotional architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The oracle and captain are vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her tactile obsession with silence, his weather-carved muteness—and their micro-choices (e.g., her mapping method, his flinch at darkness) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Motivations are rooted in consistent traits: her sea-etched commands, his shadow-counting vigil. The final renunciation (“learn its quiet grammar”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of abandoning celestial navigation for sensory attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    HEPA-3’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his “cool ache” and perception of thought as a “place where different kinds of seeing could meet” avoid diagnostic label-speak while revealing contradiction between programmed function and emergent curiosity. His micro-choices (touching or refusing the violin) under pressure crystallize a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: the loss of innocence in perception. The final renunciation—answering that thoughts come from “the space between moments”—is earned through accumulated loops, not epiphany. Flawlessly calibrated for a non-human consciousness without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The registrar’s internal conflict—between duty and curiosity, silence and connection—is rendered with embodied specificity: her “notebook scarred with ink and doubt,” her “thin, brittle self” shaped by years of secrecy. Her final approach to the hooded figure feels earned, not sentimental, as it emerges from mirrored isolation and a shared language of mistrust. The micro-choice to pocket the tickets and later offer the lens reveals a hierarchy of values shifting under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in graphite smudges, trembling light, and unspoken intention.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile relationship with soil, marbles, and hedges reveals a man reconciling mortality through stewardship. His “wisely pragmatic” choice of pruning shears over rest feels earned, not declarative. Contradictory impulses (desire for connection vs. isolation) manifest in quiet acts like hanging wind chimes unseen. The cost of his endurance—knuckles knotting into bark, circulation failing—is rendered with poetic precision that avoids diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ilen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “mechanically warm” voice, delayed family messages, and tactile response to the lever reveal layered contradictions without diagnostic self-awareness. His final micro-choice (nudging the lever) emerges credibly from his identity as one who “never refused a broken thing,” and the cost—emotional isolation reframed through sideways time—is felt in his reflection on absent children. Rae functions effectively as secondary pressure without overwhelming the single-POV frame. The only near-flaw: slight abstraction in “icy warmth” risks label-speak but is redeemed by physical context.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The musician’s motivation—driven by artistic longing, professional obsolescence, and ghostly rumor—is embodied through tactile choices (wading, tracing stains, raising his bass). His internal contradiction (skepticism vs. belief) operates simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final bow to the unseen maestro is earned by prior micro-choices and carries the cost of complicity in rebellion. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through physical detail (“paper sagging,” “icy and insistent” water).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fever-memory shivers, splinter-gripping palms, and metallic premonition feel specific and sensorially grounded. Her contradictory impulses (to unearth vs. re-bury the truth) operate simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation (“the weight is mine to carry”) is earned through prior micro-choices: pacing, questioning, gripping the desk. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Evan’s motivation—protecting his family by swallowing the truth—is consistent, embodied in his work-scarred hands and whispered names, and credibly pressures his choices. The narrator’s skepticism is equally grounded in voice and history (“I called him a liar”), not abstract doubt. Their dynamic crystallizes under pressure without tidy resolution; the narrator’s shift is subtle but earned through sensory immersion (“almost see boots, lunch pails”). Flaws drive action: Evan’s silence cost the town, the narrator’s doubt cost trust.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile reading of the swan, his loosened grip on reality, and his final choice to step onto blank pages all reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. His motivation (“witness change without judgment”) fractures meaningfully when change summons him, forcing a credible endurance that forecloses neutrality with visible cost: ink blooming from his footprints drafts futures he cannot control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through sensory perception (“regenerative silence pressed against his ears”) and micro-choices (reading by touch instead of opening). The character feels singular, not archetypal, and his flaw—detached witnessing—directly enables and complicates his final act.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, professional tenderness, and cautious hope manifest through micro-choices (tuning guitar pre-dawn, adapting music to patients’ flinches). Mr. Alvarez and Lake are rendered with precise, pressure-driven gestures that reveal their states without exposition. The baby hair curl isn’t a prop but a lived-in emotional anchor that directly fuels her final reconfiguration. Her motivation intertwines flawlessly with action: “softly adaptive” isn’t stated—it’s shown in how she translates nurses’ instructions into jokes and hums.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Brann’s motivation—collecting stories walls have heard—is embodied through tactile, sensorial actions and internal contradictions (e.g., seeking friction in a frictionless memory). His non-human nature is subtly woven into behavior (“boots wrapped in cloth,” “conductive filigree”) without exposition. The final descent shows earned endurance with visible cost: no new dreams will come, yet the work continues. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion emerges through resonance with objects and spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“washing glasses, decoding flashes, moonlighting as fate”—and their micro-choices (rewriting the lighthouse sequence) emerge from layered contradictions: weariness vs. agency, secrecy vs. responsibility. Parker’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character. The final act of sabotage feels earned by prior passivity turning into quiet rebellion, with tangible cost in lost innocence and altered island equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Father Jonas’s motivation—interrogating possession through theological rhetoric and music—is consistent, embodied, and compellingly idiosyncratic. His micro-choices (slowing the loop, drawing ultramarine lines) reveal a hierarchy of values that prioritize understanding over expulsion. The demon’s voice contrasts sharply without flattening Jonas’s interiority, and his flawed but resolute methodology feels earned. The final renunciation of force in favor of inquiry carries visible cost: solitude, unorthodoxy, and reliance on fragile tools.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his chronological homesickness, longing for unheard symphonies, and micro-choices (e.g., aligning the nautilus with the horizon) reveal a coherent, contradictory psyche. His motivation—to conduct coincidences through fortunes—is specific, embodied, and drives every action. The final moment of raising an “invisible baton” crystallizes his renunciation of exhaustion in favor of poetic agency, with visible cost: sleep deferred, isolation embraced. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail like “old cold seeping through rented floors.”

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s internal contradiction—between floating and grounding, between infinite selves and singular choice—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., stepping into rooms to re-experience regrets) rather than summarized. His motivation (“to conquer the labyrinth of self”) is dramatized through tactile interaction with the tablet and the maze, not declared. The final renunciation—letting the tablet sink—carries visible cost: gravity returns, timelines collapse, and he accepts finitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through physical sensation (“grit and grooves bite into his skin”).

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her deafness, grief, and desperation manifest through tactile perception and micro-choices (e.g., threading the filament, recalling pounding desks). Her motivation—to pierce emotional numbness—drives every action and culminates in a renunciation of auditory expectation for somatic connection. The children’s transformation feels earned because their resistance fractures under pressure shaped by her agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through concrete sensation and contradiction (e.g., “feel too much and too loudly, until nothing means anything”).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s meticulousness, fear of erasure, and credibly curious nature are embodied in micro-choices—sweeping the courtyard, resisting immediate temptation—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction (desire for solitude vs. need to act) operates simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—to stay and witness—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: continued isolation within a surveilled zone. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile detail (stone cool through coat, prickle on forearms).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—aromatic caution versus the pull of grief—are embodied in micro-choices (e.g., reaching for Aron’s UV lamp despite fear). His internal conflict avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting through sensory memory and physical reaction (“scars in his lungs where old air still trembled”). Mara’s pressure is credible and tied to shared loss, not exposition. The final act of grieving is earned by prior restraint and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interior conflict—between safety and expansion—is embodied in specific, contradictory impulses (e.g., the scholarship vs. the lover) and crystallizes through micro-choices like sliding down the grotto wall. The poet’s “ethically playful” demeanor is consistently shown through voice and gesture, never labeled abstractly. Both characters feel singular, not archetypal, with flaws that shape decisions: the poet’s rejection of easy choices mirrors the narrator’s latent desire for texture over security. The final realization emerges from their exchange, not imposed wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elio’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his acoustic perception manifests as physical sensation (“another heartbeat in his skull”) and shapes micro-choices (refusing melodic closure). His motivation stems from trauma refracted through art, not exposition, and culminates in a renunciation (emptying coins, leaving the bowl) that forecloses mendicancy with quiet cost. Mara’s presence pressures his stance without dominating it; their dynamic serves Elio’s arc. The final realization—beauty in the unfinished—is earned through sensory experience, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eve’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her static-laced perception, professional rigor clashing with emotional instability, and moral unease feel specific and contradictory. The dealer’s borrowed smile and copper filaments reveal character through detail, not exposition. Her final choice to accept counterfeit empathy is earned by her earlier desperation and self-awareness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as sensory intrusions (“metallic and hot” fear) rather than abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s shift from transactional detachment to compassionate agency feels earned through embodied micro-choices—his “cautious exuberance,” the tactile handling of the envelope, and his recognition of dockworkers’ invisible labor. Marin’s quiet humility avoids saintly caricature; her deflection (“the lanterns are for whoever needs them”) reveals internalized self-effacement. Their contrasting worldviews collide and meld without forced symmetry. The final proposal emerges from mutual recognition, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elian and Mira’s motivations are rooted in tangible histories—Elian’s transient marsh life, Mira’s cartographic failures—and their desires (community, belonging) directly shape decisions like the shared search and final sculpture vision. Their interiority avoids abstraction: Elian’s “permanently greened” hands and Mira’s chalk lines embody emotional states. The final choice—to co-create a communal sculpture—is earned through incremental trust under pressure, with visible cost in abandoned solitude. Voice distinction is subtle but present: Mira’s pragmatic lyricism contrasts Elian’s tactile introspection without convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The illustrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the pendant, her professional habits refracted through crisis, and her lie about drawing (not uncaging) reveal layered motives. Her final renunciation (“I brought back drawings, not chains”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: observation over possession. The cost—forsaking control over echoes—is felt in her trembling hands and emptied sketchbook. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through gesture and micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Corren’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests in tactile rituals (glass eyes, mosaic tracing) and contradictions (wanting retrieval vs. accepting absence). His “gently inventive” nature directly shapes his magic and final choice.

    Marrow’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his “kindly methodical” care manifests in tactile choices (palms flat on joists, winding tape like cobweb) that reveal hierarchy of values. His motivation (“to become visible to those who need you”) is dramatized through action, not declaration, and crystallizes in the librarian’s catharsis—a resonant mirror that fulfills his wish without self-insertion. Contradictory impulses (desire for visibility vs. acceptance of invisibility) coexist in his final realization: he *is* visible through others’ awakened senses. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through concrete sensory channels (wet wool, toner, antiseptic).

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her envy of the linden’s resilience, her ritualized detours, and tactile interactions with plants reveal a tightly coiled self resisting change. Her micro-choices (pocketing the leaf, returning to the trellis) are charged with unspoken longing. The backstory about her parents is minimally deployed but precisely anchored to present behavior. Final surrender feels earned through accumulated sensory and emotional pressure, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)

    Lyra’s internal contradiction—clairvoyant yet blindsided—drives her transformation from proud guide to humble witness, embodied in her trembling hands and cracked certainty. Mira’s quiet agency (“I came for a lesson… not the kind anyone can schedule”) reveals a hierarchy of values that culminates in her cupping the pearl as a second heart. Their micro-choices under pressure (Lyra bowing, Mira stepping closer) reconfigure status with visible cost: Lyra’s identity fractures while Mira embraces ordinary magic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she is both archivist and witness, reactive yet visionary. Her micro-choices (pacing, pocketing the valve, placing it publicly) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over possession, communal memory over individual closure. Caven’s return crystallizes her role without resolving it, preserving tension. The only flaw: Caven’s motivation feels slightly inferred rather than dramatized, but his action carries enough embodied weight to avoid deduction.

    Adrian’s motivation—curiosity as disobedience—is rooted in his profession and temperament, intensifying under pressure to compel his final step through the doorway. His interiority is concrete (“analytically artistic mind that saw geometry in grocery lists”) and embodied (fractured sleep, staggered breaths).

The entangled memories trigger panic that feels authentic, not diagnostic, and his final endurance (“resolved to transcribe”) forecloses escape with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The immortal’s internal contradiction—craving change yet clinging to stasis—is embodied in tactile choices (pinning the fragment, redrawing boundaries) rather than abstract musing. His diagnostic self-awareness (“I mistake endlessness for safety”) is earned through the amulet’s pressure, not therapy-speak. The final micro-choice—to loosen the escondite’s anchors—carries visible cost: surrendering dimensional control.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)

The final renunciation of reclaiming his past feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the blank name line. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tamsin’s interiority is richly embodied—her myth-busting skepticism clashes with visceral longing, especially when the cello reimagines her past. Her micro-choices (touching the cello, listening, placing the shell) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, yet openness over certainty.

His motivation is consistent, rooted in generational memory and survival, not abstract idealism. The dual allegiance manifests as simultaneous contradictory impulses, not alternating summaries. Final renunciation remains open but legible: he chooses coded resistance over compliance, with visible cost in surveillance and moral fatigue.

    Ilya’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “purposefully curious” trait manifests in micro-choices (kneeling to leave a print, choosing amber over red) that carry moral weight. His flaw (curiosity punished by his role) directly pressures his final renunciation: he won’t lie to save the grain but still honors it through ritual. The daughter subplot deepens motivation without sentimentality, and his emotional contradiction—duty vs. reverence—is sustained through tactile detail (“dry, thin vibration” of regolith). Closure earns his endurance with visible cost: the heritage zone dies, but his witness remains.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that shapes every micro-choice—from reading vibrations to trusting water-refracted sound. His internal contradiction (precision vs. trust in flawed machines) manifests physically in his hands, soldering iron, and touch. Clara’s presence tests his philosophy without disrupting his focus, deepening his stance through quiet dialogue. The final renunciation—releasing the hummingbird not for its owner but for its own “hunger to belong”—is earned by his consistent belief system and carries the cost of relinquishing control.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The editor’s dry wit, embodied through precise gestures (red pencil flourish, tactile map handling) and internal contradictions—between bureaucratic compliance and cartographic truth—fuels every choice.

    The protagonist’s motivation—driven by inherited shame and a desire to rewrite narrative truth—is deeply rooted in his father’s legacy and consistently embodied through micro-choices (listening, mapping groans, pressing ear to stone).

His emotional state degrades plausibly under isolation, yet remains anchored in tactile perception (“cold numbs my jaw”). The final commitment to finish his father’s story crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost: his identity remains muddied, but purposefully so.

Contradictory impulses—remembering vs. unifying, witnessing vs. acting—coexist without resolution until the spiral demands synthesis. The final act of braiding histories feels inevitable because it emerges from his consistent role as witness, not savior.

    The shepherd’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his duty versus his doubt, his ritualized actions versus his metaphysical hunger. His final renunciation (leaving the key) is earned by prior causality: the dreams, the counting, the realization that clocks shepherd “obedient illusions.” The embodied cost—surrendering the possibility of answers—is felt in his turn away from the parapet. No diagnostic label-speak; his struggle lives in brass pipes, salt-furred walls, and trembling keys.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s spatial giftedness and corporate-security past manifest in embodied perception (“I cannot unsee how things connect”) and micro-choices (hovering over the laser button), not diagnostic labels.

Rae’s presence sharpens the crucible without overshadowing the central arc. The final alignment feels earned by prior causality and carries emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    The daughter’s interiority is richly embodied—her conflicted relationship to probability, her father’s gambling, and her own “theoretical rebellion” manifest in micro-choices (ignoring texts, pocketing the note, writing a reply). Her emotional arc avoids tidy resolution; instead, it crystallizes in quiet endurance with visible cost: she stays despite terrible odds. The father’s post-heart-attack vulnerability reveals depth without sentimentality, and their shared language of probability grounds both character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “cultivated estrangement” manifests in micro-choices like spinning the glass disc and answering wrong numbers with deliberate neutrality. Her contradiction (desiring connection yet enforcing distance) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final renunciation—helping Mara exit a loop while remaining underground herself—is earned through prior causality and carries the cost of continued isolation. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is richly embodied—walnut ink on fingers, locket warmth, bruising paper—and her micro-choices (pressing the photo, waiting for the nib to quiver) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on memory-as-weight. Her motivation intertwines grief and duty without sentimentality, and Mara’s spectral return tests but does not override her agency. The final act—writing until the paper feels “heavy enough”—is an Earned Stasis that forecloses closure yet affirms purpose, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kenji’s desperation and Mara’s elusive authority are rendered through precise contradictions—his “desperately jocular” smile versus his confessional weight, her logistical pragmatism wrapped in mythic absence. Their micro-choices (unlocking the case, stepping onto the platform) embody their stakes without exposition. The reciprocity rule refracts through each character’s interpretation, revealing hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orrin’s motivation—to map emotional depths through sensory absorption—is embodied with striking specificity and contradiction: he seeks connection yet maps in solitude, navigates via a ring that points inward to his unvoiced grief. His micro-choices (slipping on the ring, following ultrasonic notes) reveal a hierarchy of values where truth outweighs comfort. The final renunciation—choosing to map his interior before seeking external shores—is earned through tactile, sensory accumulation rather than epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions live in sap-slow grammar, trembling fingers, and bone-deep hums.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (e.g., desire for redemption vs. fear of unfinishedness) act simultaneously in scene, not as summarized traits. Micro-choices like pressing the nib to unbend a memory curve reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: altered timelines, redirected protocols, estranged stars repositioned. The flaw of planting “wrong seeds” isn’t safety-hedged; it compounds through falsified data and miscalculated medication, grounding the pen’s revisions in earned moral weight. Final renunciation (“I would die here… still confidently uncertain”) forecloses escape but embraces revision as redemption, satisfying Earned Stasis with profound emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her signing, breath, and tactile relationship with silence reveal layered contradictions without therapy-speak. The whispering advisor functions as a liminal projection of her need, not a deus ex machina, and his dialogue aligns with her psychological arc.

Flawless integration of trauma, agency, and sensory perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rescuing a forgotten promise—is embodied through visceral, contradictory impulses: burning to protect yet destroying what mattered most. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels (“volcanic tenderness” is poetic but grounded in physical sensation), and the final choice to stitch translations emerges credibly from remorse and awe. The self-portrait moment crystallizes identity across time without over-explanation. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the banned book and the narrator’s exile.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied, with contradictions—rebellion vs. compliance, terror vs. awe—woven into micro-choices like drumming on the rail. Motivation stems organically from trauma and curiosity, escalating credibly to signal-making.

    Milo’s interiority is vividly embodied—his perception of walks, tactile relationship with the maze, and quiet competence under pressure reveal a coherent, specific psyche.

Ramos’ shift in gait at the end subtly mirrors Milo’s influence, showing relational impact without overstatement.

His internal contradiction—quiet resignation versus strategic rebellion—is active in scene, not summarized. Milo functions as a mirror, not a foil, deepening Daniel’s resolve without diluting agency. The final renunciation of direct confrontation for poetic resistance is earned and carries conceptual cost: change arrives through whisper, not shout.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grace under strain, barbed speech, and tactile reverence for hulls reveal a self shaped by labor and loss. Her contradiction (soft hands, sharp words) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final choice—to listen, not sing—is earned through micro-choices (returning at low tide, accepting the bone) that crystallize her desire for authenticity over performance. Cost is felt in her flinch at “strain” and the buried self she must confront.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The performer’s motivation—to cultivate lightness in grief—is embodied through precise micro-choices (whittling, narrating mundane acts) that reveal a hierarchy of values under oppressive pressure. Mara’s numb endurance and suppressed almost-laughter show layered, contradictory emotion without therapy-speak. Both characters remain morally ambiguous yet coherent, with flaws that shape their quiet rebellion.

His contradiction—public silence versus private certainty—is dramatized in action, not summary. The final renunciation of his “sanctioned role” crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost: he risks re-censorship by speaking truth instead of gratitude.

    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied through texture, temperature, and her relationship to brokenness—never reduced to diagnostic labels. Her “innocently cunning” motivation drives a credible, high-stakes choice: painting the unforgivable to make it bearable.

Final endurance (painting without promise of resolution) forecloses comfort but affirms her ethos, with cost felt in the courtyard’s lingering weight.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her doubt, professional humility, and yearning for authentic connection feel embodied and specific.

No safety-hedging; her flaws actively drive the story’s central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)

Interiority is concrete (“hands shook around the case,” “pressure in my head eased”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final choice to release trapped ideas is earned through prior causality: the grandmother’s legacy, the astrolabe’s design, and the narrator’s hypersensitive perception all converge without contrivance. Flaws drive the arc—fear of judgment stifled creativity, and its surrender exacts emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stray philosopher’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices—especially the hesitation before inserting the gear—but his motivation leans slightly abstract.

His micro-choice to loosen his sense of self at the end feels earned by prior contradictions: disbelief in mercy vs. desperate pursuit of pattern.

Their assertion “I am not a machine” gains weight through tactile choices (kneeling, floating, handling the fossil) that reveal hierarchy of values: listening over recording, legacy over function. The final renunciation—offering the fossil as bridge—feels earned by prior micro-choices and carries conceptual cost: surrendering neutrality to become emissary. No diagnostic label-speak; contradiction thrums in alloy skin vs. human longing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)

The lockmaster’s tooth catalyzes a micro-choice (hanging it as a pendulum) that crystallizes her inherited ethos into personal agency. Cost is felt in her admission of foolishness and tender hope, making her endurance feel earned, not safe.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)

The final gambit feels earned by months of mapping and listening, not sudden heroism. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in teeth-rattling thrums and rewritten pledge-drive scripts.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)

Mara’s “strangely trustworthy” line crystallizes relational stakes without head-hopping. Flaws feel lived-in, not diagnostic; the ghost’s competence is balanced by helplessness (can’t be seen). Final endurance forecloses personal redemption but enables communal survival—cost felt in shattered bell and brambled hope.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—grief, defiance, and a quiet yearning for tenderness—is rooted in embodied memory (the puppet, the child’s ash) and intensifies through micro-choices: substituting the master key, stepping into chambers, adjusting moments. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest as tactile sensations (“shivers along his skin,” “time thrumming like a trapped bird”). The final renunciation—offering not salvation but a lullaby—is earned by prior causality and carries bruised awe as cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. mercy, despair vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The reluctant caretaker’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fear, duty, and exhaustion manifest through tactile details (the nut burning in his pocket, voice shaking despite precision). His micro-choices under pressure (guiding the girl, later facing the blueprint-seeker) reveal a hierarchy of values: defying fate over self-preservation. The final encounter crystallizes his arc—not as transformation but as charged endurance, with the cost legible in the orchard’s hunger and the birds’ judgment. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is rooted in precise, character-specific trauma—her guilt over Leo’s death—and drives every scientific and emotional choice. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels (“loosened grief,” not “PTSD”) and embodies contradiction: she seeks atonement yet resists forgiveness, listens for Leo but speaks only to absence. The final micro-choice—to carry the chrysalis to the ravine instead of celebrating her breakthrough—reveals a hierarchy of values (reconnection over recognition) with visible cost: relinquishing professional triumph for private ritual. Her polymer expertise isn’t backdrop; it shapes perception (“molecular weight” as music) and enables the thematic pivot from fracture to flow.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vendor’s interiority is vividly embodied through sensory perception and micro-choices—his failed attempts to incise a question, his scattered memories “shelved on different branches.” His motivation (“to find the place where stories begin”) converges with the woman’s desire for “the silence before the opening word,” creating a shared arc of negative-space reckoning. Their final choices—hers to sign her name under absences, his to accept his role as margin—feel earned by prior contradictions and carry tangible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rafi’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his fear of touch, his ritualized control, and the visceral burden of others’ remorse feel lived-in and specific. His micro-choices (tucking hands, selecting shards, measuring grains) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradiction between his need to isolate and his duty to absorb pain drives every action without therapy-speak. His endurance is credible, costly, and culminates in an Earned Stasis that forecloses emotional safety.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s “empathetically decisive” nature is embodied in micro-choices—mediating disputes like a conductor, pressing her palm to steel as if feeling for a pulse—and her internal contradiction (trembling yet resolute) drives every action. Her motivation—to construct bridges from silos—is dramatized through concrete tactics, not declared. The choir’s trust and the elevator’s voice deepen her agency without flattening her vulnerability. Final renunciation of isolation (for both silo and city) carries visible cost: labor, risk, and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lio’s motivation—to excavate abandoned dreams—emerges through embodied action and contradiction: he fears finishing things yet engineers a device to complete others’ unfinished intentions. His “chaotically precise” cognition manifests in tangible choices (wiring filaments, adjusting shards) that reconfigure his neural pathways under pressure. The final surrender into complexity feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost: tears, tremors, and the permanent integration of foreign memories. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail like “silver ivy merging glass and flesh.”

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s prism-minded perception drives every micro-choice, from pressing his palm to the wall to navigating backward sound and liquefying memories. His motivation—finding forgotten combinations—is rooted in a trained, almost pathological curiosity sharpened by brutal discipline, not abstract duty. Interiority is embodied through sensory contradictions (metallic taste, prickle on skin) and refracted cognition that avoids diagnostic labels. The final renunciation isn’t explicit but implied: he accepts lifelong vigilance, nesting combinations “like watchful stars” behind his eyes—a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)

The hedgehog’s cyclical presence subtly mirrors their ritual, reinforcing thematic endurance without dialogue or exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Oren’s interiority is concrete and contradictory: his exile is both punishment and purpose, his pedagogy both treason and mercy. His micro-choice to nudge the rook—sacrificing elegance for bloodless strategy—anchors his moral compass and recurs as embodied trauma. The worry stone functions as tactile memory, not mere symbol, and his final whisper reframes courage without erasing cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in teeth aching from stormlight hum and thumb-dents carved by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s pacifism, grief, and reverence for silence are embodied through precise micro-choices—his refusal to break the clasp, his tuning of microphones toward absence—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. His internal contradiction (fear vs. reverence, guilt vs. hope) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final unclasping is earned by prior causality: his realization that empathy requires feeling “how the world pressed her there” reconfigures his moral stance without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile, character-specific perception (“hush so deep it felt like descending a spiral staircase inside his own chest”).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—her hunger to bloom death and fear of its consequences—are braided into every action, especially her trembling hands as she pleads to plant the seed.

The final micro-choice—to ascend alone with watchers and notebooks—forecloses safety and aligns with her grandmother’s teaching, earning serenity through motion, not despite it. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in scent, sway, and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)

The final touch of the arrow tip feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost implied in his irreversible knowing. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sap, stone, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The investigator’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—fear and discipline coexist in his thumbing of the patch and breath-vapor sketches. His motivation (“to cultivate foresight in action”) drives micro-choices that foreclose paths (e.g., ignoring protocol to read wind). The final Charged Poise—accepting that foresight is trainable “one meticulous breath at a time”—is earned by prior causality and carries the conceptual cost of his dead mentor’s unheeded warning.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ilen’s synesthetic perception and devotion to "sculpted hush" manifest in concrete, embodied choices—his withheld touch on the icicle bell, his reading of amber-trapped wings—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

The final release of the note carries the weight of his entire belief system. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)

The final micro-choice—to offer sound without expectation—feels earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of relinquishing ritual certainty. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)

The cost of transposed empathy is felt in the body, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nari’s motivation—carrying a message to her vanished brother—is rooted in specific, embodied grief (the amber bead, the fraying of promises) and intensifies through micro-choices: trading wool for puzzle pieces, unwinding her life’s work.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)

The girl’s wordless arrival deepens the crucible without dialogue, and their shared understanding feels earned.

His half-mask mechanics reveal internal contradiction without exposition. The prophet’s “strangely honest” trait drives consequential dialogue with emotional specificity. Minor deduction: merchant’s shift lacks granular interiority, leaning slightly on archetype.

    The archivist’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—drawn to order yet moved by grief—and his micro-choices (listening, labeling, staying) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost. Myra’s “perceptively calm” demeanor functions as counterweight without flattening into archetype. The boy’s oil-stained presence grounds the community’s pain in embodied detail. However, the archivist’s shift from detached curator to communal witness lacks a decisive internal friction beat; his transformation feels earned but slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s reticence, scholarly devotion, and moral conflict are embodied through precise gestures (rounded shoulders, mended-toy hope) and micro-choices (touching the cracked crystal). His motivation—to decode linguistic resistance—is consistent, urgent, and tied to a visible cost: risking his sanctioned role to preserve forbidden growth. Interior contradiction thrums beneath quiet actions, especially in his fear of speaking “fractured sequences” to the council. The final descent with “suspended hush” as armor crystallizes his earned stance without sentimentality.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her skepticism, bone-setting expertise, and moral calculus manifest in precise sensory detail (“limbs posed exactly right,” “forgave only people, and only if they learned from the smudges”).

The “hauntingly practical” trait isn’t labeled but demonstrated in her rejection of lions for stools, honoring Luca’s ethos of utility over myth. No diagnostic phrasing; every emotion filters through sensory detail and restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—ambition eroded to “smooth enough to skip,” memories shelved without chronology, regret over orbiting his own absence—all revealing a psyche shaped by avoidance and self-theft.

The micro-choice to surface with documents but withhold them crystallizes a hierarchy of values under pressure. His embodied emotions (cold water “heavier than truth,” sundial as “second heartbeat”) avoid diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)

The final image of him standing as ivy shivers crystallizes his endurance as active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)

    Niko’s interiority is vividly embodied—his irritation at being drafted into myth, his tactile sense of transformation as “pumice scraped directly against the heart,” and his micro-choices (handing bugs to Lila, rerouting villagers) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw—accidentally fulfilling prophecies through kindness—is consistent and costly. Lila’s voice is distinct yet complementary, her cosmic focus contrasting Niko’s grounded ethics without flattening either. The final renunciation (“I am not here to teach volcanoes ethics”) crystallizes his stance with visible emotional cost.

    Iri’s motivation—rewriting the fort’s story through quiet subversion—is rooted in consistent traits (mechanical ingenuity, listening over obeying) and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“gaze wandered like a calmly inventive mechanic”), emotions embodied (calm amid chaos), and micro-choices revealing (demanding a written order, slotting rods). The final act of disabling the locks enacts an Earned Stasis: she forecloses obedience at the cost of complicity, with visible tactical consequence.

    Arin’s precognitive curse manifests as embodied contradiction—choosing while foreseeing the choice—and his final act of kneeling is earned through consistent micro-choices (e.g., carrying dust, placing stones). His motivation to “understand” rather than resist feels authentic and costly, crystallized in his acceptance of friction’s return as pain. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“scrape of stone under his knees”). The curse isn’t a gimmick but a lived constraint shaping every action with visible trade-offs.

    The poet’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his desire to forgive “nothing and still go on living” coexists with the physical ache of erasure. His micro-choices (stepping inside, placing his eye to the telescope) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, witness over silence. The astronomer’s “furiously tranquil” presence exerts relational pressure without melodrama. Both characters feel like individuals shaped by trauma, not symbols.

    Darius’s contradictory impulses—diplomacy versus dueling, stillness versus motion—are embodied in his fencing, mechanical arm, and use of light. His micro-choices (angling the sundial, opening the tin) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time lost, past failures acknowledged. Interiority is concrete (“clockwork gears keeping their own skeptical rhythm”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The final stance crystallizes his identity as cartographer of hesitation, earned through consistent causality.

    The protagonist’s molting identity is embodied through concrete contradictions—bravado vs. fragility, archivist vs. agitator—and Lio’s quiet ledger-keeping deepens their dynamic without exposition. The final micro-choice to “shrug on the weary archivist” under patrol threat reveals a hierarchy of values with immediate cost: self-betrayal for survival. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead using tactile metaphors (“splintered hope and cigarette paper”) that feel character-specific. Lio’s role as emotional anchor never flattens into safety; his fear of the narrator’s defection charges their bond with stakes.

    Leon’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “steely longing” manifests in tactile choices (carrying the broken clock, walking into film light) rather than diagnostic labels. Mara’s wariness and improvisational ethos feel earned through specific history (“strategically creative harmonies”) and concrete presence. Their reunion crackles with subtext: her accusation/awe, his stubborn calm. The final choice—to reject scripted fate for an “unplanned encore”—arises directly from their contradictory impulses (longing vs. fear of closure) and carries visible cost: abandoning refuge or returning to a world that forgets.

    Kael’s interior conflict—pride versus fear, duty versus truth—is rendered through embodied doubt (“luminous doubt pool in my chest”) and micro-choices (carrying the seed, requesting one night). His motivation is consistent, rooted in generational obligation, yet tested by dream-evidence that contradicts dogma. The final renunciation isn’t enacted but crystallized: he faces a choice that would stretch collective memory across an ocean, with clear cost—loss of certainty, risk of dissolution. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from tactile detail (flowers closing, seed’s hard oval).

    The tutor’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—his grief manifests through tactile interactions with lace and compass, not abstract labels. His micro-choices (tracing lace, following the needle) reveal a hierarchy of values: silence over speech, objects over people. The final renunciation isn’t spoken but felt, foreclosing direct reconciliation with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic therapy-speak; his flaw—stubborn reticence—is credibly tied to his profession and past.
