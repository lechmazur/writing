    Elias is rendered through concrete particulars—his vial ritual, his patient mapping—and the final sabbatical email offers a motivated choice that forecloses academic theatrics. However, the interiority relies heavily on metaphoric abstraction ("neutron star researcher… understood decay as a kind of poetry") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The shift from performance to witness reads as declared insight more than dramatized struggle; we're told he "understood" and "recognized" rather than shown contradictory impulses colliding in scene. The final renunciation has causal grounding but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered concretely through physical action (tracing frost, folding the ledger). The brother revelation provides genuine contradiction and cost. However, the final renunciation ("She didn't need the ledger anymore") arrives through assertion rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses options with visible struggle. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("the illusion that purpose was something you could melt and mold") without embodied contradiction acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical details (bleeding fingers, salt in veins, scars). The core motivation—to translate silence into music—drives on-page choices through the piano sequence. However, the mentor's philosophizing ("Sound is just emotion given shape") veers toward label-speak, and the final decision to "sail back into the storm" lacks visible cost or earned contradiction; the pivot feels asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is credibly characterized through embodied detail—cracked hands, stubborn work ethic—and his final choice (adding his own name to the ledger) emerges from a consistent motivation to grant rest. Internal contradiction is present in his rationalism versus acceptance of the lens's signal, though the shift feels slightly abrupt. The insight "rest wasn't the absence of movement" is earned through the lighthouse climb and the dead's acknowledgment, but edges toward articulated epiphany rather than pure dramatization. Minor deduction for the closure moment's slight didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's gentle persistence is embodied through concrete actions (midnight runs, teaching Liora, standing with the bell), but internal conflict is largely absent—his choices feel preordained rather than genuinely difficult. The community functions more as backdrop than pressure; secondary characters (Liora, Manir, the widows) apply minimal individuated opposition. Liora's note and the final stance crystallization earn points, but the arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is given a coherent through-line—physician haunted by unspoken care—but his present choices are mostly observational until the final gesture. The memory surfaces whole rather than being earned through on-page contradiction or micro-choices that test his commitment. Embodiment is intermittent: "fingers trembling" works, but much interiority leans on poetic assertion ("certainty that this was the spark") rather than sensory particulars that would ground his state under pressure. The final laugh and shadow-whole moment gesture at transformation, yet the cost of carrying versus letting go is asserted more than dramatized through a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her final decision to hurl the fragment and then design edges carries agency with visible cost. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated poetic register ("texture," "seam," "when") that abstracts emotional stakes rather than grounding them in embodied contradiction. The woman's warning and dissolution provide pressure, but Liora's internal conflict remains largely declarative rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final laugh and understanding feel asserted more than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena demonstrates patience and strategic thinking through her vault infiltration and guard trap, with embodied detail in her seed-handling and whispered mantra. However, interiority remains thin—her six years in a cell are told rather than shown through present micro-choices, and the "chained liberator" label does explanatory work without dramatized contradiction. The guard's confusion and her departure feel competent but lack visible internal cost or competing impulses that would elevate the characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to collect absences and imprint trust-breaking is established, but his final choice—extinguishing the forge and wading into the tide—feels more like atmospheric closure than a decision that forecloses a lived path with visible cost. Interior texture is vivid ("bruise of indigo, the color of a promise kept too long") but leans heavily on synesthetic metaphor rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The sister's silence and grandfather's laughter function as backstory anchors, yet no on-page micro-choice dramatizes a hierarchy of values with legible tradeoff. Interiority is poetic but risks label-speak ("frequency just below grief") at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's core motivation (collecting illuminated moments) is established early and drives her choices, but the character work relies heavily on atmospheric declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic choice—hurling the jar—feels more symbolic than psychologically earned; we don't see her internal calculus shift through micro-choices under pressure. The stationmaster remains functional but flat, existing primarily to deliver exposition. The final transformation ("she became it") abstracts rather than grounds the cost in specific renunciation or gain.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is consistently filtered through glasswork imagery ("thin enough to shatter with a whisper"), grounding her craft identity throughout. The return to the control room and final valve-turn are motivated by inheritance and craft philosophy, though the father's "sanctuary for the curious" framing feels slightly abstract. Micro-choices—tracing switches, peeling logbook pages, turning the valve—accumulate pressure, and the final walk away with empty orbs suggests genuine cost (leaving the project unfinished). However, the pivot from "I won't return" to valve-turn lacks a visible on-page friction or counter-impulse that would dramatize the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's motivation to reclaim proof of her identity drives the plot, but her interior contradictions remain told rather than enacted in real time. The phobia of open water is referenced repeatedly yet never constrains an on-page choice or compounds pressure. The girl character appears solely to deliver exposition and prompt Lena's pivot, functioning as a device rather than a pressure source. Emotional vocabulary ("coiled tighter," "clawed at her ribs") leans on stock metaphor without specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eldrin remains a static conduit for lyric meditation rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting under pressure. His "mild obsession" with silence is asserted but never tested—no choice forces him to weigh competing values or foreclose a path with visible cost. The woman defender and the world itself supply atmosphere but impose no relational crucible or status friction. Interiority remains abstract label-speak ("the way silence could be a wound or a cradle") rather than embodied micro-choices that alter present options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    X-7's interior is present but largely abstract—"processors hummed," "core temperature dropped"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "exhaled...inhaled" gesture offers specificity, but the path to "remember how to live" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Motivation is told ("Where do thoughts come from?") without dramatized friction between want and cost. The robot's composure is asserted but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interior work is heavily reflective and symbolic rather than dramatized under pressure. The couple remains abstract—their conflict is overheard, not enacted through choice or contradiction. Lena's final "clarity" is asserted through repetitive metaphor ("not secrets. Not lies. Just the shape of truth") rather than earned through an on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path. The lens and doodle habits are told as backstory; no internal conflict or visible tradeoff materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vine dresser's interiority is present—polishing marbles, refusing to argue, leading elders to the maze's center—but the internal contradiction remains thin. Her love of the garden is asserted rather than shown through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The elders' conversion ("fuller hearts, ready to learn") arrives without visible cost or resistance, flattening what could have been a charged renunciation or endurance moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; the piece leans on summary of her relationship with the garden rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his technical competence balanced with obsessive need to prove his theory creates authentic tension. The interior work is mostly concrete—"mechanically warm" hands, the tactile pull of the lever—though some reflections drift toward generic profundity ("time wasn't something to be measured, but something to step through"). The final choice to rest his hand on the lever rather than pull again embodies renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing further experimentation. Micro-choices throughout (ignoring the AI, adjusting the lever "finer this time") reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—drawn to decode the ghost's signs—and his micro-choices (tracing the program, prying up the floorboard, choosing to wait instead of play) demonstrate agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present in his desire to "disrupt something" versus the careful order he's maintained, though this tension could intensify more visibly in peak beats. The ghost Clara remains an effective pressure source but her interiority is necessarily abstract; the embodied emotion ("pulse quickened," "fingers trembled") is sufficient but leans toward stock gestures. The final choice to answer the ghost feels earned by the accumulated clues, though the cost—what Elias forfeits by engaging this liminal space—remains more atmospheric than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's interiority is vivid and embodied—the trembling hands, the flinch at ice-shearing—but her final choice to walk into the storm feels unmotivated by prior micro-choices; the pivot from oracle to self-annihilation lacks a clear causal trigger. Internal contradiction (certainty vs. margins) is articulated but not dramatized in simultaneous competing impulses within a single beat. The cost of her departure is visible in the abandoned station and silenced warning, but the decision itself reads more as thematic gesture than earned character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied—his father's confession drives him into the tunnel, and his skepticism ("a reflex, honed by years") anchors interiority. The micro-choice to turn the valve wheel under pressure is dramatized, though the final renunciation ("Some were meant to be carried") edges toward epiphany without fully embodying the cost. Internal contradiction appears when he flings the radio yet remains seated afterward, showing hypocrisy under stress. No secondary character applies immediate pressure; relationship bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The keeper's interiority is present but remains abstract and generic—"loose grip on reality," dissolution of thoughts "like ink in rain"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "buried their name" moment gestures at renunciation but never dramatizes what was traded or how options narrowed. Internal experience stays static across the entire arc; no competing impulse acts in scene, only meditative observation. Agency is observation, not decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is given clear motivational continuity (the childhood memory, the tuning fork metaphor) and his therapeutic approach is embodied through concrete actions. However, his interior contradictions remain muted—his choices feel competent and adaptive without visible cost or foreclosed paths until the very end. The vial transfer and song at the eclipse read more as facilitation than a decision that alters his own stance with friction. Mira's arc from silence to humming is earned on the page, but her interiority is absent, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is rendered through concrete, embodied action—tracing stitches, pressing tapestry to cheek, feeding pages to embers—and his motivation (collecting wall-heard stories) drives each move. Interior texture is specific ("a hook behind his ribs") and contradictory impulses emerge when he doesn't resist the displacement tug, showing acceptance over struggle. The final smile is "cracked at the edges," an earned micro-choice that forecloses retreat. Minor issue: the "sensitively perceptive fingers" phrase leans toward label-only in its first mention, though later tactile details recover specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chen's choices are motivated and consistent—copying specs, directing the handoff, orchestrating through fortunes—but interiority remains functional rather than deeply embodied. The "orchestrator" trait is labeled more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The fisherman's daughter and absent cook provide pressure but little relationship crucible. Emotional states are declared ("Chen laughed, low and familiar") rather than shown through physiological specificity or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The priest's interior stance reads as abstract philosophical posture rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" remains stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The possession entity and the novice function as symbolic tokens; their reactions don't constrain the priest's moves or force trade-offs. The transformation into indigo feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Li Wei's interiority is concrete and specific—his homesickness mapped onto fortune-writing feels embodied through details like the metronome of his mother's sewing machine. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between oracle-precision and personal grief, and the final conducting gesture shows agency. However, the backstory threatens to overwhelm present choices; while reflection is anchored (shell → memory → present realization), it occupies roughly 40% of the text and the micro-choices that tilt present stance are subtle rather than decisive. The change from writing to conducting reads more as metaphorical shift than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The collision with his shadow-self reads as a symbolic gesture without the micro-choices and visible tradeoffs that would make the merger feel earned. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("gravity itself hesitated," "versions of him that peeled away like wet paper") without character-particular texture. The final renunciation of the tablet and viaduct carries some cost, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract through most of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation (defeating numbness) is embodied through tactile engagement—tracing drumheads, feeling vibrations—and culminates in a visible shift: the decision to teach again with a new method, accepting silence as productive rather than empty. The drum maker remains somewhat functional rather than fully individuated, existing primarily to deliver the backward-song revelation. The broken needle operates as both literal object and internalized symbol of loss, though the transition from despair to agency could be more causally dense. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between his grief over being called "useless" and his ultimate acceptance that silence carries meaning, but the arc leans slightly toward epiphany rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through his meticulous craft and observational discipline, but his interiority remains largely cerebral without embodied contradiction. The decision to record rather than act reads as consistent refusal, yet the cost of solitude is asserted ("the quiet work of a man who knew some truths were too heavy for company") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or micro-choice under pressure. His "credibly curious nature warring with the discipline" is told, not shown in conflicting impulses that act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "record the silence" feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's internal landscape is rendered through concrete sensory engagement—touching rope texture, carving ladder rungs—with embodied curiosity driving micro-choices. However, the protagonist remains more observer than actor under genuine pressure; his "ethically playful" nature is asserted ("steal a loaf of bread just to leave a poem") but never tested on the page with visible cost. The energy beings function as atmospheric witnesses rather than forces that complicate his agency. The final ladder-carving gesture feels more symbolic completion than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's interiority is consistent and embodied through her craft—calloused fingers, acoustically perceptive ears, the unfinished melody all anchor motive. The introduction of the child shifts her stance credibly, and the decision to begin "something new" with visible cost (abandoning her father's unfinished work) reads as earned. Internal contradiction is present (holding onto the past vs. stepping into the future) and acts simultaneously in the final beats. Minor slip: the child's arrival feels slightly convenient, though the ensuing exchange earns emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's professional thoroughness comes through in her calibrated cuffs and diagnostic process, but her interior life remains largely functional rather than contradictory. The chemist's cowardice and tenderness are told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final crying beat earns some emotional weight, but his transformation from wanting counterfeit longing to authentic grief feels rushed, with the key shift occurring in Liora's single gesture rather than through his own on-page struggle. The closing reflection on half-truths as loneliness reads more thematic than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly seeded—the mother's history of generosity anchors his impulse to return the locket and propose the partnership. His interior shows purposeful contradiction: "not out of sentiment, but because…" yet he kept it for years. The librarian's choice to meet and agree feels slightly underearned given the abrupt jump from wary to collaborative; the midnight meeting compresses what might need more friction. Embodied emotion is present (clutching overdue notices "like a shield") but peak beats lean toward summary ("they'd drafted a plan") rather than showing the negotiation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Reed's motivation to graft onto community is legible and drives the search choice, but her interior life remains abstract—we see her trace paint and organize searchers without embodied contradiction or struggle. The turn from solitary sculptor to community organizer happens cleanly but lacks on-page friction between her want for belonging and the cost of vulnerability. Syl remains a cipher whose scars and violet hands gesture toward depth without dramatized choice, functioning more as symbolic fulfillment than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elspeth's interiority is concrete and shows genuine stakes—the moths disappearing, the pendant's hum, the decision to hurl the jar—but her internal conflict remains understated. The boy appears as a cryptic device rather than a pressure source, and her motivations shift without visible struggle: she moves from seeking echoes to destroying the jar without dramatized deliberation. The final choice (pulling the echo's leash) arrives without a felt cost that forecloses a visible path; the moths simply return and she resumes work, suggesting endurance rather than transformation but without the visible price Earned Stasis requires.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conjurer's interiority is consistently lyric and abstract—"map grief the way others mapped constellations"—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His final acceptance ("some equations weren't meant to balance") feels arrived-at rather than fought through moment-by-moment micro-choices. The wife exists only in reflection; no secondary character applies live pressure. Embodiment is often metaphoric ("the hollow in his chest") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's cache-keeping motivation is signaled early and drives his final choice to reveal himself with visible cost (seventeen years of isolation ended). His interiority remains specific ("the sound had burrowed into him") and embodied under pressure. The woman's arc is thinner—her recognition lands but lacks prior contradiction or struggle that would elevate the closure choice. Minor: "raw and bright, like the first spark after a blackout" edges toward label-plus-simile rather than fully embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's arc from control to surrender is embodied through concrete actions—pulling up stakes, pressing leaves under microscope—and her final choice to hand the customer a linden leaf with "don't tell it how to grow" emerges from prior pressure. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous need to catalog ("reached for her notebook") and impulse to surrender, creating genuine tension. The whispered apology to roots and barefoot mud-work ground the transformation physically. Minor slip: the "laughter raw and unfamiliar, like a seed splitting open" leans toward therapy-speak at a peak beat, but the embodied choices recover momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through exhaustion and turpentine-rough hands, his insomnia rooted in war trauma. His wry laugh at the island's waiting and the choice to place the brooch despite knowing better show contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final dream sequence and waking smile complete an earned shift from paralysis to renewed purpose, though the "haggard enough to see the cracks" framing edges toward articulation of what should remain implicit. Backstory threads (water wars, ten years painting) anchor present choices cleanly within the BRR window.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's arc from straining clairvoyant to receptive inhabitant is structurally clear, but the transformation arrives through declaration rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The entity's therapeutic insights feel imposed rather than earned through struggle—"magic isn't in the grand gestures" reads as authorial thesis. The final renunciation (leaving the pearl) lacks visible cost; she walks away "lighter," suggesting gain without trade-off. Interiority leans toward stock epiphany language ("the one truth she'd somehow missed") that flattens the character's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's arc is earned through concrete choices—assembling fragments, listening to the valve, distributing the ledger—and the final toss to the child embodies renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is embodied ("hands trembled—not from cold, but from the weight") and contradictory impulses appear when he climbs away from the crowd yet engages the child. The secondary characters (fisherman's daughter, dockworker, child) apply immediate pressure and deepen his mission. Backstory of the exile anchors present stakes cleanly, but the phrase "reactively visionary" ("His vision had always been reactive, flaring brightest when the world withheld its light") reads as diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, triggering a −0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in grief, with the compass work and phantom punch showing character-specific problem-solving. The sister reveal lands emotionally but arrives so late that the interior work feels more expository than contradictory-in-scene. His final choice to return to the mist reads as earned, though the epiphany ("some mysteries weren't meant to be solved") skirts diagnostic abstraction. The backstory reflection is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the vault, the phantom punch) and tilts his stance toward release rather than pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's skepticism is established early and her grief for her brother motivates her actions throughout. The internal contradiction between disbelief and yearning ("she scoffed at magic, but the tile's weight in her palm felt like an answer") drives her choices. However, the final transformation feels rushed—her shift from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes" lacks visible struggle in the peak moment. The brother's apparition arrives without her earning it through sufficient on-page resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysander's boredom and desire for goodbye are clearly signaled, but his internal contradictions remain largely decorative. The dropping of the amulet feels motivated by curiosity rather than earned through on-page struggle between contradictory impulses. The embodied emotion is sparse—most interiority is abstract philosophizing ("boredom was a slow poison") rather than concrete perception under pressure. The final choice lacks visible cost because we never see what path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and her internal contradiction—wanting fairness while inheriting her father's con-artist math—drives key choices. The girl's arrival and their collaboration feel somewhat convenient, weakening agency at the climax. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("her throat tightened," "her pulse spiked") rather than character-particular embodiment. The final renunciation has weight but the twelve-for-her realization arrives late without sufficient prior seeding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stationer's motivation to "collect textures" is clear and consistent, but his agency is primarily observational—he transcribes, invents, and records rather than making choices under pressure. The key moment when Elara's story surfaces feels more like a passive reception than a decision with cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; he's presented as studious and earnest without complicating impulses that would force harder trade-offs. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (trembling fingers, quickened pulse) but much of the interiority leans toward abstract longing rather than micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Daniel's interiority shows consistent perceptual signature—his ear for "layers" in port sounds, his gathering impulse—but motivation remains largely told rather than tested under pressure. The collecting behavior reads more as symbolic texture than embodied drive with contradictory stakes. Micro-choices (pressing ear to 47-B, leaving offerings) exist but feel ritual rather than conflicted. The final act of pressing the bundle into steel lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternative that would earn the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows distinct voice ("gloomy cheerfulness was his brand"), but his journey from myth buster to myth keeper arrives more through metaphorical realization than embodied choice under pressure. The grandmother's voice is reimagined through the cello, satisfying the "reimagines past conversations" trait, yet the final shift—writing on his own skin—feels more like thematic declaration than a foreclosure with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (debunking miracles while praying for one) but remains abstract; the peak moment lacks a concrete tradeoff that would anchor the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's dual allegiance is clearly established and her internal contradiction operates in scene through micro-choices (prying the chip, embedding it in the mural). However, interiority leans heavily on abstract self-narration ("her dual allegiance gnawed at her") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The protagonist's choices feel motivated but are never genuinely difficult—she consistently chooses resistance without visible internal cost or foreclosed paths, weakening the sense of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is selective and embodied—"the weight of the camera suddenly heavier" and "his thumb traced the camera's screen"—with contradictory impulses visible in the choice to plant the canister while knowing the drones will erase everything. However, the trait "purposefully curious" appears only as a label in early reflection without constraining a later choice, and the final renunciation (boarding the ship) feels more resigned than earned by a prior dramatized trade-off. The emotional arc tracks cleanly but the climactic boarding reads passive, limiting the cost's visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's blindness is embodied through specific sensory compensations (vibration through boots, water-barrel refraction) and his thirty-year expertise grounds his capability. The repair choice emerges organically from his diagnostic process rather than external pressure, which limits internal contradiction. The captain's brass-voice acknowledgment and his return to the shop show a credible loop of competence and solitude, though no prior path is visibly foreclosed—he continues his routine. Interiority remains specific to his perceptual world; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is vivid and embodied—her atlas-editor wit and precise observation ground her perspective. However, her final choice lacks visible internal conflict; she steps forward with only a smile, no dramatized contradiction between fear and resolve. The endurance/acceptance reads more as mystical destiny than a choice that forecloses a path with felt personal cost. Kael remains a backstory sketch without on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tuner's motivation is embodied through his patient, deliberate walking and fork-striking, but internal contradiction is absent—he moves with unwavering confidence rather than genuine struggle. The final moment ("the scales felt even") edges toward label-speak rather than dramatized cost. Interiority remains atmospheric and consistent but lacks the complexity of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The single-POV lens is stable, with no secondary characters generating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to harness the hush is established early and drives her into the temple, but her internal contradiction—guilt over abandoning the team versus self-preservation—remains largely told rather than acted in simultaneous conflict. The perfume uncorking and letting "the hush take her" shows a decisive choice, yet the mechanism of transformation feels abstract; we see Elias's ghost-invitation but not the embodied cost of acceptance. The ending renunciation ("done answering") and inland move suggest earned change, though the final paragraphs summarize emotional states ("learned to live with its quiet") rather than dramatizing the weight of what she carries forward.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("hush," "rewoven echoes") rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. His motivations—wanting to "change the beginning" and retrieve his father's name—register thematically but lack embodied cost or visible tradeoff when he performs the climactic act. The final choice (taking the name, descending) feels gestural rather than foreclosing a live option with felt consequence. Minor: "boy who cried wolf's son" premise seeds expectation but never pressures a lie/truth dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is sustained (debt-payment across lifetimes), but her interior is largely poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The keeper and Vesper receive minimal interiority; their presence registers more as atmospheric function than individuated agents with stakes. The final dissolution reads as inevitable rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses alternatives. Embodied emotion is scarce—"petals crumbling," "wind through dead branches" are lyric metaphors, not physical sensation or micro-choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias moves through sleepwalking with a stated motive ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") but the interiority remains abstract—phrases like "eyes held a light that didn't belong to this world" and "haunting optimism" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (stepping toward dawn) lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; he simply walks forward without dramatized cost. Micro-choices during the sleepwalking are absent; he moves by "older knowing" rather than making decisions under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to restore the orchard through working with roots and bones is clear and embodied through methodical action. His interior life shows warmth and curiosity without self-diagnostic labeling, and his micro-choices (planting the seed, following roots deeper) reveal commitment. However, the journey from skeptic ("didn't believe in miracles") to believer feels under-dramatized; the sapling's emergence shifts his stance without visible internal friction or cost that would make the change feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and her pseudo-professional methodology feels character-specific ("carefully inventive" as compass). The micro-choices around the name and the hesitation at the mailbox show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. However, the final choice lacks visible cost—mailing the letter feels procedural rather than a forfeiture or trade-off that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the closure beat doesn't carry the weight needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is characterized primarily through ornamental symbolic actions (threading needles through cosmos, humming off-key) rather than credible internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The courier's arrival provides an external trigger, but Elias's response—feeding the note to the flame, refusing to run—reads as performed wisdom rather than a choice shaped by competing impulses. His final stance lacks visible cost; the observatory's destruction is framed as triumph rather than sacrifice, and no prior path is foreclosed with felt weight. Interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("listen," "broadcast," "stars singing") without grounding in concrete sensory experience or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear—she seeks the moment before deciding and moves through physical action (carrying the letter, pressing the shard, releasing it into water). However, interiority often defaults to lyric abstraction ("the heart still hovers between flight and surrender") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to release the letter is signaled but the cost feels atmospheric rather than visceral; we don't witness a specific capability or relationship foreclosed. Embodied emotion is present in gestures but the internal conflict remains more told than shown in contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's translator identity is embodied through precise gestures—unknotting the child's crayon marks, reading negative space in the photo—with clear internal contradiction between her role as "grafter" and her chronic pain. The boy's arrival creates pressure, but Lena's response feels predetermined rather than chosen under duress; her gift of the coral reads more as priestly benediction than a trade-off with visible cost. Minor embodiment slips: "her pulse steady" during the photo examination tells rather than shows calm under pressure. The ending gesture (walking toward the mist) suggests endurance but doesn't foreclose a path on the page with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation to rediscover lost joy is established early and her choices to map the district, capture the fragment, and create the projection all flow from this desire. The piece keeps her interior focused on the work rather than therapeutic self-diagnosis; emotions are tied to the task ("her breath catch," "hands trembled"). However, the final transformation feels convenient—the fog parts, the scent of peaches materializes, the woman reaches into the projection—without on-page friction or cost to Liora herself. The ending promises future work but doesn't foreclose a path or exact a felt price scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear (escape certainty for curiosity) and her choices are consistently grounded in that desire. However, the nested awakening cycles flatten internal contradiction; her choices feel more ornamental than costly. The fresco figures and fig-woman/old man appear as mystical guides without applying genuine pressure or resistance. The final "again" acceptance reads as predetermined rather than earned through struggle, limiting the felt weight of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits a clear motivation—protecting unregistered thought—and makes choices that advance the resistance plot (planting coded gardens, adjusting messages). His "charming rogue scholar" trait remains largely label-only; we see competence but little internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure. The final move into "chaos" reads as a summary rather than a decisive choice forged from competing impulses with visible cost. Supporting cast (botanist, librarian, teenager) are functional but underdeveloped, applying pressure without distinct interior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interiority is vivid and embodied ("bones humming," "fingers tracing"), but her interior struggle remains abstract—ensconcing the postcard and singing louder are gestures without visible cost or competing impulses dramatized in scene. The ghost's exchange offers a moment of contradiction ("You sing to us" / "I sing through you"), but his transformation happens to him rather than through a choice the poet wrestles with. The manual-writing sequence introduces micro-choices (send, tuck, eat), yet these feel ornamental rather than rooted in a hierarchy of values under pressure. No meaningful path is foreclosed with felt cost; she continues her work unaltered.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interior life is vivid and embodied through gesture (pressing palm to chime, covering ears) and the final choice to break rather than preserve creates contradictory impulses acted in scene. The thirty-year tenure and systematic grace establish character-specific priorities that drive the climactic decision. Minor slip: the realization "some things were not meant to be preserved" edges toward articulated insight rather than purely dramatized understanding, though it remains anchored in the physical act of releasing the chime. The emotional progression from tender caretaking to desperate action under supernatural pressure reads credible and rooted in established motive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation (penance for a past translation that split a kingdom) is clear and ties to the present crisis. Her "carefully reckless" trait is labeled but only modestly demonstrated in her leap to restore the archive. Internal contradiction is present (trust vs. mistrust of her voice) but the final shift feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under sustained pressure. The embodied emotion is uneven: "breath that tasted of iron and old paper" works, but "fingers still vibrating with the language's pulse" leans decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's interior life is established through embodied detail—her pulse stutters, her hands don't tremble at the climax—and her choice at the ending forecloses the path of compliance with visible cost (elder disapproval, valley risk). Internal contradiction appears when she weighs safety versus compassion, and the final stance crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the elders remain underdeveloped as pressure agents; their capitulation feels slightly convenient, muting the cost of her defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and embodied—trembling hands, flinching at silence, the meteorite pressed to his palm. His agency crystallizes in the final act of sending the pigeon and allowing himself to hum, a visible shift from years of refusal. The letter and returned sheet music motivate his arc convincingly, though the "maestro"/"liar" flashback leans slightly toward label rather than dramatized contradiction. Minor: Luca remains more cipher than pressure source, reducing relationship crucible slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows clear motivation (finding Liora) and the grain-following moment reveals problem-solving under pressure. Liora's interiority at closure carries weight ("some thresholds need to be crossed alone"), but her arc remains thin—we see determination more than contradiction. The climactic choice (Elias climbing down rather than pulling her up) is motivated but the emotional cost feels muted; his acceptance arrives too smoothly without visible struggle in the sinkhole beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is rendered through vivid particulars—the burnt feather, the celestial scope, the jellyfireflies—but her motivations remain largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. The "rhythm of belonging" is told as her drive, yet no on-page choice forces her to trade off competing goods or accept visible cost. Kael arrives as a mirror rather than an antagonist, and their shared moment reads more as convergence than a choice that forecloses a path. The final separation (she stays, he surfaces) carries implied weight but lacks dramatized struggle or contradiction that would earn the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The recollectionist's motivation is signaled early and her actions cohere with her role, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("the tide's regret," "unspoken fear"). The moment when her blood glows iridescent lands as epiphany-by-prop rather than earned contradiction. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are thin; the final "she knew" declares insight without prior dramatic friction that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's perceptual signature—calculating timing, weaving environmental variables—is distinctive and embodied through specific micro-choices (angle shifts, bow speed). His motivation to "orchestrate serendipity" drives concrete actions that alter tactics beat by beat. However, the final exchange with the moth-shawled woman lands as thesis statement ("I played the space between the notes") rather than earned contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interior remains surface-analytical without genuine friction between competing impulses at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tide dancer's interiority is present but remains abstract throughout—"penance for reading the tides too well" and the exile are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to inscribe the verse is signaled early but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; the character moves smoothly toward her goal without friction. Embodied emotion is sparse; the text favors lyric register over specific physical sensation under pressure. The ending gesture ("she let it come") reads passive rather than as a micro-choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—the prism's warmth, the stone's weight—and his micro-choices (selecting the stone, aligning the prism) reveal a hierarchy of values. The daughter's absence creates a credible loss that shapes his ritual without over-articulation. Minor weakness: the communion moment edges toward stock phrasing ("the way he always did before the world shifted"), but the ending choice to reach for the next stone earns the renunciation of waiting. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is embodied through sensory particulars (breath curling, gravel voice, rough hands) and his interiority shows contradictory impulses—grief versus hope, isolation versus connection. His internal conflict between silence and reaching out drives the final choice to send the image and leave the box, though the epiphany about "alchemize" reads slightly diagnostic. The phone call from his ex-wife applies immediate pressure that forces the climactic gesture. Minor slip: the transition from bargaining with fire to understanding the box as offering feels asserted rather than fully earned through on-page beats.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora demonstrates consistent interiority around hope-as-equation and her grandfather's legacy, but her motivation remains largely abstract. The piece offers embodied moments ("pressed her palm against the stone," handling the gauge), yet the protagonist's stakes never materialize as a concrete cost or trade-off—she moves through gestures without facing a choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is absent; she operates in a state of serene curiosity that doesn't degrade or sharpen under pressure. The final "let the tide carry her forward" reads passive rather than a renunciation or crystallized stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his perceptual acuity is embodied through specific sensory work (tuning fork, half-burned diaries, ear that catches drafts). The interiority shows contradiction—he wants to know what walls dream but more whether they dream of him—and the final choice to complete the mural and walk away reads as earned. However, the emotional progression from discovery to completion feels compressed; the transition from "hands shook" to serene smile lacks intermediate embodied struggle, and the mother's-eyes moment doesn't visibly complicate his tactics in the alcove or sealed-door beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to paint mirages is established early, but her interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm gaze" and choosing not to look at her own reflection are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The choice to let the mirror slip feels thematically purposeful but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; we're told she tried once before, but that backstory doesn't anchor a present micro-choice. The soldier's borrowed heartbeat and the woman's payment structure suggest stakes, yet Liora's agency at closure reads more as routine withdrawal than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra's interiority is embodied through the clipboard's weight and her physical control ("fingers unclenching, voice a river over rocks"), and her tactical use of the past signature creates pressure. Kael's internal conflict emerges through contradictory impulses—reaching for the blade while his voice "unravels, already human." The final renunciation ("You'll break this one too") carries visible cost, though Kael's arc compresses quickly. Minor slip: "muster the part of you that still believes in mornings" edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in his prior concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is coherently drawn as a calculating figure with amoral philanthropy on record, and the egg placement offers a visible choice under pressure. However, the core contradiction—mourning versus manufacturing the drought—is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices; we never see him wrestle with competing impulses in scene. The final turn ("enough") lacks prior interiority showing why this moment breaks his pattern. The backstory exceeds acceptable reflection density without anchoring each beat to a present micro-choice that alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's core motive—defying conformity—is stated but never tested by a competing pull or cost that would dramatize internal conflict. The "chaste courtesan" label and "bodily poetic" descriptor remain ornamental; no on-page action shows her restraint or movement as a verse under pressure. The final laugh and humming voices are asserted emotional states without embodied contradiction or a choice that forecloses a visible path. Interiority relies on elevated abstraction ("vessel for what the world had tried to erase") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations and choices are present but abstract. His decision to "let the puppets stumble" and show the seams arrives with minimal prior dramatization of the ethical dilemma—the miner's rage is told in past summary rather than witnessed. Interior contradiction exists (precision vs. deliberate looseness) but remains conceptual rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final stance crystallizes but without a visible, felt cost that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's motivation to honor what the world forgot is clear and drives his structure-building, but his interior remains largely static—an observer cataloging rather than contradicting impulses. The decision to build "today's structure" differently is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin; the work feels more like a ritual performed than a struggle felt. No visible cost forecloses a path; he simply continues gathering materials at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's characterization is rooted in craft (wax caster, silver work) and regret over unrecorded dialect. The motivation is clear and the final renunciation—letting names change rather than holding tight—foreclosures the path of preservation-as-stasis. However, interior texture leans toward elevated abstractions ("the shape of their absence," "chiseling regrets from her own ribs") that feel more thematic than embodied, and the emotional progression from guilt to forgiveness reads smooth rather than contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interior experience is densely textured with embodied perception (the wafer seal's warmth, breath fogging glass), and her agency drives key beats—pressing the seal, choosing to reach toward the storm. However, the final turn ("she'd been walking in circles all along") feels unearned by prior causality; her realization lacks a specific on-page contradiction or discovery that would make the insight concrete rather than abstract. The murals' shift and the dream-Lior encounter offer intriguing internal conflict, but the protagonist's stance at closure—laughter, surrender—reads more as lyric release than a choice with visible cost tied to her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Qishti's motivation is clear and his actions follow a consistent pattern of scholarly devotion, but his internal experience remains largely analytical without embodied contradiction. The final kneeling "not in worship, but in recognition" gestures toward complexity but arrives through declaration rather than dramatized tension between competing impulses. Micro-choices (hesitation at the threshold, pressing the tile) are present but lack visible cost that forecloses options. The character reads as a vehicle for the premise rather than a figure wrestling with genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interiority is vivid and embodied—"chest ached," fingers tracing the broken pin—and his micro-choices (prying the pin free, pressing it back) drive the arc. However, the boy-ghost Kael remains more allegorical than interpersonally pressured; their exchanges feel designed to articulate theme rather than test contradictory impulses in real time. The final renunciation (walking away, leaving the box) reads earned by prior causality, but the peak beat leans toward therapeutic articulation ("You taught me to hold onto things") rather than dramatized friction with visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mirror maker's interiority leans heavily on metaphor and atmospheric description rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The brother relationship is told through reflection ("had been his brother once") without on-page friction or a dramatized cost that tests commitment. The protagonist's final choice to "let go" arrives as summary assertion rather than a decision forced by prior causality with visible trade-off. Internal voice remains coherent but the peak moment lacks the embodied struggle required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mender's interiority is textured and specific—"brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse"—and embodied contradictions emerge (pride vs. yearning, duty vs. discovery). The daughter is rendered through absence and traces, yet her feistiness and deliberate leaving ("a taunt, a plea, a breadcrumb trail") create a legible relationship crucible. Minor slip: the peak moment of eating the apple feels slightly under-motivated as a live choice; the micro-choices leading to it are present but the trade-off could be sharper. The final binding of the ribbon around the mender's wrist carries visible cost—acknowledgment of their blindness—earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's interior is vivid and specific—her bemused hunger, the laughter at danger—but key beats rely on stock metaphors ("key" slotting into mind) and therapy-speak lite ("nonlinear inheritance" as epiphany rather than embodied pressure). The final choice to prepare the artifact for another lacks visible cost: she smiles and returns to work without foreclosing a live path or demonstrating renunciation. The cameo's mirror-reflection moment carries contradictory impulse briefly, but the ending flattens that tension into approval without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through consistent calculation and exploitation—his manipulation of the time traveler via forget-me-not tea, his theft of the botanical diary, and his final realization arrive with internal logic. The ending's weeping feels somewhat abrupt given his prior coldness, though "grief was a renewable resource" establishes a pattern. Interiority remains concrete ("heard the whispers between words the way others heard music"), but the traveler remains underdeveloped—his desperation is told more than shown in choices. The final cost (becoming a gap himself) is legible but the emotional shift from calculating thief to weeping figure compresses quickly without intermediate contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her final choice to help other lost souls is earned through the premise. However, her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—the scales on her wrist are described but never constrain a choice. The sister's transformation is told through metaphor ("edges smudged like a half-remembered dream") without dramatized struggle or cost that forecloses a visible path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's choices are motivated and her sensory processing is vivid ("breath fogging," "grain shifted"), but interiority often drifts into elevated exposition ("merging the strands in new configurations—silence into knowledge") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The peak moment—"she would become part of it"—reads as abstract realization rather than a micro-choice with visible cost. The figure's line "You're late" and Elara's reply show professional competence but little internal friction or blind spot that would drive mistake or meaningful forfeiture. Her final decision to pocket the seal and not record feels thematically tidy rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eldrin's interiority is embodied and specific—"unspooling the tension in his own bones" and the stone warming against his skin ground his sensory experience. His motivation (preservation over escape) shapes his actions consistently, and the final choice to "keep listening" after the storm changes represents earned endurance with visible cost. Minor issue: the energy beings lack distinct agency or resistance that would deepen the relational crucible; they flicker and recoil but never press back with individuated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The custodian's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—she seeks meaning in coincidences while knowing retrocognition only shows missed pasts. Her renunciation of rescue in favor of pattern recognition feels earned through prior causality. Internal conflict is embodied ("teeth ache," "quiet in her own ribs") rather than summarized. The backstory about her mother's face is well-anchored and tilts her present choice, though the reflective load approaches the BRR ceiling without quite exceeding it since it primes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Summer-Quill's interiority is richly embodied through sensory detail and her interaction with the crystal flags, and the "preemptively nostalgic" trait shapes her perceptual filter throughout. However, the final shift—realizing "identity wasn't something you sculpted from experience—it was what remained when you stopped trying to shape it at all"—arrives as insight rather than through a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The arc is more contemplative realization than contradictory impulses forcing a hard choice, weakening the causality of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistently held—she chases light that refuses to be smothered—and her decision to launch fireworks despite the cursed sky is earned. Internal contradiction appears briefly when she laughs with "smoke and wonder," showing genuine risk-taking embodied in the act. However, the moment when she finds the mosaic and immediately understands its message lacks genuine struggle or misinterpretation; the insight arrives too cleanly. The final renunciation (walking away with lighter pockets) carries visible cost but feels compressed rather than wrestled with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is vividly embodied through her tangential observation style, and the fisherman's grief is rendered with concrete silence rather than therapy-speak. However, the protagonist's agency remains largely observational—she traces, withdraws, watches, and finally gives the cicada away, but none of these acts meaningfully narrow her own options or foreclose a path with visible cost. The fisherman receives more character work (his wife's death, his cracked voice, his eventual departure), yet he remains secondary. The ending gesture feels generous but not earned by prior struggle that tests the chronicler's own stake.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The child's motivation ("to collect the flavors of different silences") is vivid and consistently embodied through tactile, synesthetic detail. Interior contradiction shows in the pull between safety and expansion, father's fear versus the child's hunger. The final choice—sprouting into the trellis and collapsing the bunker—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (abandoning the father). The doll's voice and the gilded palm register as slightly convenient conduits rather than fully integrated internal struggle, keeping this out of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is granted interiority through his storm glass and dial work, and the passenger's embodied grief (damp gloves, profile angles, unspoken weight) reads concretely. However, neither character makes a difficult on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—Elias performs his established ritual, the passenger simply exhales and departs. The ending offers stillness but no contradictory impulses or meaningful renunciation that would earn the transformation claimed. Motivation remains atmospheric rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elsin's core motivation (find the stairway, unmake the throne) is established and drives her descent, but the decisive pivot—realizing the throne must be destroyed rather than claimed—arrives without sufficient dramatized internal resistance. The choice to walk away feels more cerebral than contradictory; we see little cost in her renunciation. Embodied emotion is thin: "her breath hitched" and a final smile are the main physical markers in a story dense with lore and objects. The lack of on-page struggle between competing impulses (ascend vs. unmake) prevents the final choice from landing with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interior is textured—"tender shadow keeper," the deliberate bridge-burning—but motivation remains abstract. The choice to step through at the end feels more thematic than earned by prior contradiction; we see his isolation but not the competing impulses that would make the turn inevitable. Embodied emotion is present ("throat tightened") but the final choice lacks visible cost tied to a hierarchy of values dramatized earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina's interiority shows contradictory impulses—she recognizes broken faith yet chooses to engage with the bolt, torn between survival pragmatism and mischief. Her mother's abandonment and the pyramid scheme provide concrete motivation that shapes her response to the quantum promise. However, the final choice to squeeze the bolt until her palm bleeds and "unthread" pressure from diamond feels under-motivated; the leap from skeptical survivor to metaphysical agent lacks sufficient on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present (tingling fingers, bleeding palm) but the climactic act reads more symbolic than psychologically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal state is reasonably embodied through his interaction with physical objects (the crank handle, mirror), and his shift from "eloquently silent in his failure" to bridge-crosser shows an arc. However, the transformation relies heavily on metaphysical revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; his grandfather's voice and the mirror's instruction feel externally granted rather than earned through internal wrestling. The final choice to write "for the next eloquently silent soul" forecasts future rather than costing present options on the page, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The knight's seven-year silence and final speech establish a clear arc, but interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("the shape of the thing that came after") rather than embodied contradiction. The moment of removing the gauntlet releases shadows—a symbolic gesture—but the choice feels dictated by metaphysical mechanics rather than earned by on-page micro-decisions that reveal competing impulses. The final smile "hurt like holy fire" gestures toward cost, yet the knight's internal conflict never dramatizes genuine struggle between staying silent and speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is rendered with consistent interiority—his archivist habit of exhaling through his nose, his tactile engagement with files, his trembling hands at discovery—that grounds motivation in embodied experience. The decision to send the envelope is earned by prior causality (his own file closure, his habit of scanning for gaps) and the cost is visible: he commits personal time and care to a stranger, risking emotional investment. Minor slip: Daniel's characterization is largely told through documents rather than shown in scene, which limits contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final turn to Maria's file demonstrates trajectory without forcing an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's resourcefulness is demonstrated through concrete actions (key in boot, decoding puddles, stolen ledger), and her renunciation of direct heroism feels character-consistent. Internal experience diverges credibly from external presentation ("harmless archivist"). However, the final-act choices feel somewhat inevitable rather than forced by contradictory impulses; the stakes crystallize but don't truly compel a difficult trade-off with visible psychological cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The saxophonist's interiority is consistent and embodied through his instrument and relationship to silence, with micro-choices like "played faster, not louder" revealing character values. However, the protagonist's motivation relies heavily on childhood memory exposition (the woman's prophecy) rather than present-scene contradiction. The final choice to return reads as compulsion rather than earned agency—no visible cost forecloses a path; he simply cycles back. Internal conflict between fear of the grotto's pull and fear of losing its call is asserted in reflection but never dramatized through competing impulses in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's baseline traits (orderly, sacred task) are established, but her interior life remains thin—we see actions (climbing, building, eating the leaf) without embodied contradiction or struggle. The transformation at the end (bark skin, thorn fingers) arrives without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path; she simply accepts and continues sorting. Micro-choices exist (placing the speck, stepping onto the ladder) but lack friction or competing wants that would reveal hierarchy of values. The piece leans on symbolic gestures rather than dramatized internal conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tinkerer's motivation is clear—seeking patterns in broken things—and his stance evolves through concrete actions (handling compass, dismantling clock). Interior voice remains consistent with a bias toward uncertainty and improvisation. However, the final shift to "befriending absence" feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle; the renunciation lacks dramatized cost that would foreclose alternate paths on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation—measuring herself against Veyra's legacy—is concrete and drives her to stay at the foundry. The final turn (feeding the coin, transmuting herself) reads as earned by the accumulated pressure. However, interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("alchemy of *meaning*," "weight of names") rather than embodied contradiction under stress, and the workshop epilogue restates the shift without adding visible cost. The choice to risk ash is present but the bodily stakes during the crucible moment are told more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's collector role is established early with embodied detail (souls "snagging on her sleeves like burrs"), and her modest fearlessness reads as earned trait rather than label. The crocodile's tooth functions as memory anchor tied to her mother's death, providing grief as backstory that motivates present action. However, her internal contradiction remains thin—she moves through the encounter without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The soul's need for integration is realized smoothly, but Liora's own stakes never intensify; she arrives capable and departs unchanged, limiting characterization depth at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liran's interiority shows embodied trauma responses (knee locking, throat sealing at ozone) and the proprioceptive enhancement manifests concretely in the opening. However, the interrogator's face in the basin and the grandmother's voice feel like external devices rather than internally contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to count silences reads as earned endurance, but the peak moment—forehead touching water—relies on visionary pressure rather than a dramatized internal conflict between competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lior's motivation to "translate between worlds" and honor overlooked histories is established early, but her interior life remains abstract—"elusively tangible" sensory gifts are told rather than shown constraining choices. The final decision to follow the lens and "pull the overlooked into the light" reads as declaration rather than embodied contradiction or visible cost. Backstory dominates (~35% by line count) yet anchors to present stimuli and micro-choices (pocketing the brush, slotting the lens) meet the BRR exception tests. Interiority leans on elevated diction ("intuition's anchor," "histories aren't overlooked—they're held") that feels more thematic than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear interior contradiction—his professional detachment versus his intuitive understanding of the building's supernatural mechanics. His micro-choices (tracing cracks, listening with the barrel, choosing to unmake rather than fix) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The ticket girl ghost provides relational pressure that forces his final choice, though her sudden solidity at the end ("touched her own wrist, her fingers solid") feels unearned by prior causality. The shift from observer to liberator is motivated but the embodiment of his emotional state during the climactic dismantling could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "compress eternity" is present but remains abstract rather than grounded in lived contradiction. The final choice—stepping onto the clouds and releasing the whisper—carries conceptual weight but lacks embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("reality had become negotiable," "he had finally printed something true") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The shift from operator to agent of rupture is told rather than dramatized through escalating choices with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to reimagine his civilization is clear and his poet-revolutionary identity provides texture, but the core decision at the climax—using the shard despite knowing it will turn to dust—lacks embodied hesitation or visible internal conflict in the moment. The relationship with Taelis is functional but thin; her conversion feels abrupt without resistance or cost on her side. Elias's emotional arc from weight to lightness is stated ("the weight in his chest lighter") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The reflective material about the Chronos Revolt provides context but does not force a micro-choice that alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation and internal state are established (thirty years of repair work, understanding hunger, calling himself a fool), and his final choice to give the stone his honesty carries weight. However, the decision lacks visible contradiction or struggle in the moment; he "laughs, low and cracked" and proceeds without embodied hesitation. The interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("mending what isn't torn—not the object, but the space between its purpose and its pain") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending forecloses his existence with cost, meeting the baseline for change, but the path feels more lyric than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's internal journey—from decade-long compulsion to delve, to understanding his father's warning, to acceptance—is embodied through tactile object-handling and physical approach to the threshold. The moment he lets his hand drop registers as genuine renunciation with visible cost (burning the notes, ceasing delving). Interiority stays concrete: "teeth ache," "the smell of things beginning." Minor slip: the shift from obsessive seeker to collector of silence feels slightly rushed in the final beats, though the groundwork (psychometry, petrichor vials) supports the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits clear motivation (selling driftwood, finding his way) and his carving skill shapes concrete choices at the archway. Interiority is specific and embodied ("fingers found the lantern slide," "breath curling into the storm"). However, the transformation at the archway—from lost to guided—feels more mystical than earned by prior internal contradiction or struggle; his decision to carve lacks a visible cost that forecloses another path. The piece gestures toward "perpetually learning" but this remains more label than dramatized limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to understand the flowers is clear and sustained, but her journey reads more as contemplative drift than a pressure-driven arc with contradictory impulses. The final realization about silence arrives through reflection rather than through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in moments like pressing her palm to the glass, but interiority often defaults to poetic abstraction ("something older than curiosity") rather than character-specific contradiction under stress. The transition from chasing answers to embracing silence lacks a dramatized micro-choice that makes the renunciation feel earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows embodied emotion ("pulse hammered in his throat") and his archivist background motivates his decipherment work, but internal contradiction is thin—he moves from hesitation to wading into the lagoon without visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. The visions function as received exposition rather than choices under pressure. Liora exists only as memory-echo; no second character applies live pressure to test Elias's commitment. The final smile and "work wasn't over" deflates cost with reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's motivation to reimagine the cove is established early, but interiority remains thin—he "understood," he "didn't dare open his eyes"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost under pressure. The child's "sticky" hand and piped question provide sensory grounding, yet the protagonist's internal conflict (conception versus comfort) is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to turn toward the town reads as acceptance rather than a foreclosing renunciation with visible tradeoff, weakening the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is rendered with specificity—his method, his memory of field trips, his 70-year practice—and his final choice to seal and bury the shaving carries cost (renunciation of recording the prophecy). The internal texture is vivid: "the way his pulse had jumped like a startled bird." However, the protagonist's engagement is largely reactive observation until the very end; he listens, receives the prophecy, and sketches his fear, but no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The closure renunciation feels consistent but lacks the contradictory pressure that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (kneeling, tracing the cap, pressing the seed). Her internal state shows genuine contradiction—"furiously tranquil" fingers, wanting the past more than the future—that plays out in scene choices. The chick-creature and vortex remain abstract pressures rather than fully realized secondary forces, but they serve their function. The final smile and certainty feel slightly unearned given the prior terror, trimming what could reach higher.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—his method of testing through listening, his hand on the bell's lip feeling residual hum, his swift reworking of the bindings. The motivation to "favor listening" drives the key choice to unknot and reweave the bindings with deliberate slack, a micro-choice under pressure with visible stakes. Internal contradiction appears when he's called "credibly curious" with "the weight of a caution," but the tension between recklessness and listening could be sharpened. Minor: the abbot's confession and prior tester's error function as backdrop without forcing a live relational crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eli's motivation is legible (spiritual curiosity, seeking connection), and the final choice to leave the station follows a pattern of openness established throughout. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("tending to the silence," "polishing the lenses of perception") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The star encounter produces epiphany without genuine internal conflict—no competing impulse resists the transformation. Emotional progression feels declarative rather than earned through contradictory wants acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The beekeeper's seventeen-year silence and embodied grief (tracing box edges, controlled breath) ground his stance effectively. The ghosts' arrival and his wordless understanding create pressure, though the protagonist remains largely reactive until the box-opening choice. His motives cohere—preserving unspoken weight—and the final renunciation (departure without speech) forecloses the path with visible cost. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction ("weight of unspoken things") rather than immediate perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concretely rendered through his relationship to timepieces and the urn fragment. The core motivation—understanding time's texture—is told rather than shown through on-page choices under pressure. The climactic decision to wind the broken watch feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we see no contradictory impulses in action, only a sudden comprehension. The protagonist observes more than he decides until the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet's interior world is rendered through embodied detail (fingers tracing sand, water beading on feather) and his consistent aesthetic—collecting fragments, tending incompletion. His micro-choices (retrieving the kite, winding the string, choosing not to write the water's shiver) reveal values under pressure. The final renunciation ("Some things were better left unstitched") feels earned by prior pattern, though the choice to stop writing lacks a visible cost that would elevate it further. Internal contradiction is present but muted; he remains comfortably aligned with his philosophy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's devotion to the orchard is richly embodied through thirty years of mapping, copper-wire work, and her choice to die in the dirt rather than accept the temple's "quiet corner." Internal contradiction appears in her laughter at the diagnosis and her refusal of honor—devotion over defiance—though her final choice feels inevitable rather than torn. Brother Tomas's arc from disapproval to weaving copper by story's end is earned through his curiosity and her lesson. The embodied detail (joints "like brittle hinges," breath "thin, like wind through dead leaves") avoids clinical labels and grounds her physical decline in the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal progression from skepticism to faith-as-science is tracked through concrete moments (the amber fly warming, her whispered answer, the final choice). However, the decision to take the figure's hand lacks sufficient on-page cost or internal contradiction; she smiles and accepts without wrestling with what she's abandoning. The father's shaking hands memory provides embodied specificity, but the final choice reads too smooth for a scientist abandoning her world. The blend of academic rebelliousness with willingness to dissolve into cosmic pilgrimage needs more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (splitting seed pods, scattering them, speaking in dead tongues), but his interior life remains largely opaque—we observe ritual without accessing the contradictory impulses that would elevate this to character work under pressure. The piece leans heavily on atmospheric description and backstory reflection (the battlefield decades past) without dramatizing a present choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The final paragraphs shift to distant summary ("Years later, fishermen would swear...") rather than staying with the protagonist's stance crystallization, weakening the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rook's motivation is established (finding the voice, following the cylinder's path), but his interior life relies heavily on stock metaphors ("bloodhound heart," "warm, damp dark") rather than concrete embodied contradiction. The final choice—entering the dome—reads more as submission to fate than a decision that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The watchers (child, mechanic) are ornamental; they apply no pressure and vanish without trace. Interiority often summarizes state ("finally understood") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation to explore rather than flee is established early and embodied through tactile engagement with the compass rose and sketchbook. The contradiction between pariah status and observer role creates tension, and micro-choices (stepping onto the railing, tearing the page free) accumulate pressure. However, the final leap reads more as lyric surrender than a decision with visible internal conflict—the "let the current take her" formulation dilutes agency at the climax. The mother's whispered voice feels unmotivated by prior dramatization, landing as convenient external validation rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lirien's core motivation—retrieving her master's legacy while offering transformation—drives clear choices, and the Keeper's trembling recognition of his name earns the exchange. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic assertion ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The swap mechanics are telegraphed but the Keeper's shift from threat to gift-giver compresses too quickly, losing the friction needed to make his choice costly on the page. Backstory about the master and three winters of carving functions but remains tell-heavy rather than anchored in present micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poeticized statements rather than concrete embodied emotion. Her motivation as "historian of small gestures" is declared but never tested against a competing impulse or difficult trade-off on the page. The "crisis actor" backstory appears purely as exposition without anchoring in present choice. While the final walking action has some cost, it reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's mercury-glass eyes and silver streaks provide striking embodiment, and his interior contradictions (boy who pressed palms over ears / man who finally reaches for the stone) show genuine struggle. The pivot from refusing talent to embracing it feels earned through the specificity of the memories (humming tune, sketching constellations). However, the final transformation into "Keeper of the Unsaid" arrives with minimal on-page hesitation or visible cost in the peak moment—he picks up the pen without shaking hands, which flattens what should be a high-stakes threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's interior life is thick with metaphor but light on contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His fidgeting is described but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it remains label-level. The final laugh and steady hands feel asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that test his flaws under pressure. The girl and villagers remain functional props without status dynamics or pressure that forces the tutor's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear—defying a corrupt ritual through verse—and her past mischief establishes character continuity. Internal contradiction appears when she whispers her accusation while bleeding to carve it, showing simultaneous fear and determination. However, the final choice feels unmotivated: she "didn't watch the spire shatter" and descends with "heart lighter," but no on-page moment dramatizes her weighing the cost of potentially killing the elders or the canyon's transformation. The resolution asserts emotional change without earning it through a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interior is densely textured with embodied regret and desperation, and the final step forward demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("face half-drowned in doubt") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The backstory fragments (teacher's whisper, drowned bird, thief-queen chain) anchor present choices but occupy significant real estate without always tilting present stance via micro-decisions. The renunciation at closure—"let go"—feels earned by the setup but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and grief-soaked, with embodied emotion in the ochre staining and the shell warming in his palm. The decision to enter the cave and later to jump reads as earned by the sustained pressure of unresolved mourning. However, the final leap feels abrupt; the choice to cross "through" rather than "down" is asserted more than dramatized, and the cost—abandoning the village—is narrated rather than tested on the page. The protagonist's arc is coherent but the climactic agency moment lacks immediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interiority is embodied through sensory cues (lavender exhale, cork texture) and contradictory impulses (need to prove versus fear of ridicule). His motivation to beckon the boats back through whispers rather than shouting drives concrete micro-choices. Harkin's arc from skepticism to recognition is earned through the cork's tactile proof. Minor slip: the dream sequence at the end tilts slightly toward label-only resolution rather than sustained contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's interiority is embodied through concrete particulars—tracing cracks in the bronze, building towers of driftwood—and the backstory block (~15%) effectively anchors her present stance. The shift from ship navigator to ruin navigator is earned through her radio work and the maps she builds, with micro-choices (lighting the candle, rolling fresh paper) revealing hierarchy of values. However, the phone-call voices remain abstract; their identity ambiguity ("echoes of herself") flirts with mysticism without grounding choices in specific contradiction or embodied cost, keeping the work strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical tells (finger twitching) and sensory detail (truffle flavor as grief). His choice to bury the eye rather than use or sell it is earned by the sister's death and the archivist's warning, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Minor weakness: the sister's jump and scream feel slightly abstract—"honesty he still couldn't parse" lacks specificity that would anchor her loss more deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior shows purposeful observation (the boutonnière investigation, the stranger's trembling hands) and the final choice to "let the light do the rest" with embodied cost—the boutonnière crumbles by dawn. However, most character work remains reflective rather than embodied: "Elias was an eccentric by necessity" tells rather than shows, and key realizations ("memories weren't his," "some memories weren't meant to be kept") arrive as assertions rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending gesture forecloses a path but the journey to it lacks visible micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is anchored in concrete detail—twenty-three years, *The Hush*, the foundry chip—and his renunciation of empirical trust for the chip's pull is legible. Internal contradiction shows when he scoffs then follows, and the final choice to walk toward the child's sob carries visible cost (he seals the door, forecloses the map-dealer path). However, the woman at the end feels unmotivated; her presence lacks causal grounding, and the ink-still-wet map reads more like symbolic convenience than earned character convergence. Interiority remains specific until the closing beats blur into setup rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's interiority shows concrete desire ("the dreams would not let her rest") and embodied action (climbing alone, kneeling, dipping her hand). The childhood memory bargain provides motivation, but the final transformation reads more as inevitable mythic metamorphosis than a choice with visible internal conflict—she laughs bitterly but does not wrestle with competing impulses in the final beat. The ending forecloses her human path with cost (abandonment of throne), but the queen-as-agent dissolves into constellation-as-outcome without a legible micro-choice that tips the balance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's desire to capture presence is established early and drives his realization that density is about giving, not taking. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("pocket-suns he'd crafted: tiny, furious things") rather than embodied contradiction, and the shift from extraction to offering feels more declared than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Liora remains functional but her internal life is mostly gestural. The final choice to jump and "become the weight" arrives quickly without visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dual-Elias structure creates interesting internal contradiction, but their motivations blur—why does Younger want to burn the scroll? The embodied emotion is strong ("feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs"), yet the final choice to "soar" feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-decisions that foreclose other paths. The jealousy of past selves is told more than dramatized in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied through sensory loss, and the water-clock work grounds his hands in present action. The woman's trembling-then-stilling hands show contradictory impulses in a single beat. However, the final shift—from measuring scents to measuring "what people carried"—reads as an epiphany delivered rather than earned through on-page friction. The micro-choices (adjusting the valve, sketching her hands) tilt present stance but remain observational; no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lian's motivation to transform scars into stories drives clear on-page choices: she carves runes, presses the quill to her pulse, and traces symbols on stone. The scars are embodied—"thin, silvered lines along her wrists where childhood experiments...had gone awry, the flesh hardening like flawed glass"—and her grandmother's whispered superstition grounds her internal logic. The final moment where "The silvered line softened, then rewove itself into a thread of light" completes an arc of renunciation and transformation with visible cost (the quill sheds its tip). However, the interiority occasionally leans toward elevated diction ("the way her grandmother had peeled back layers of onion skin to reveal the heart of a meal") that feels externally poeticized rather than emerging from Lian's specific perceptual signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is established early and drives key choices, but her interior life often defaults to metaphor-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The relationship with Elias provides genuine pressure at the perfume-use beat and the final planting exchange, but the resolution arrives quickly after one major choice with limited on-page struggle. Elias's trembling hands and deflating-bellows exhalation offer physical specificity, yet emotional progression leans on declarative turns ("It hurts." / "Good.") that tell state more than they dramatize internal friction. The final mutual gesture—passing the shovel—earns the shift but could have been deepened by one more micro-choice that costs either character something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The witness remains abstract throughout—motivation is declared ("unravel the cosmic illusions") but never tested against a specific desire or fear that would create internal contradiction. The tearing of the dictionary feels unmotivated by prior struggle; no choice forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on metaphysical labels ("the weight of being the end") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choice under pressure. The final fruit-tasting moment introduces specificity too late to anchor character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is strongly embodied through goggles, key, counting ritual, and the physical tension of gripping the key. Internal conflict surfaces when he must choose whether to wind the clock despite the risk, and his realization that he's a gatekeeper rather than shepherd shifts his stance with visible cost (the new notch). Minor slip: the woman's line "You have to let go" feels slightly generic for such a charged moment, but the decision to release the key remains causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's motivation is established through her father's illness and her contrarian relationship to his worldview, with the decision to light the lantern twice offering meaningful agency. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous desire to escape his model while still calculating odds his way. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("theoretically rebellious energy," "lazy word for incomplete data") rather than embodied particulars, and the final choice to "let the contradictions hold her" reads more as thematic statement than earned emotional progression. The character arc lands but the path there favors philosophical voice over lived-in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows consistent traits (isolation, ritualized care, teaching endings), and his micro-choices with the caller are purposeful. However, the caller remains largely abstract—her confessions arrive pre-digested without embodied resistance or contradiction, and Elias's responses feel more symbolic than driven by internal conflict. The ending gesture (hanging up first, waiting for the next call) reads as Earned Stasis but lacks visible cost; we see ritual confirmed, not a path foreclosed. Embodied emotion is present in traces ("thumb to the harmonica's edge until the glass sang") but diluted by reflective summary in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear—preserving memory through ink and objects—but her interior life remains abstract across most beats. Embodied contradiction appears only briefly ("the bitterness became part of her"), and the final walk feels more stated than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths. The man in the locket exists as memory-object rather than complicating force; no secondary character applies immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena is established through concrete choices—fixing the radio, diagnosing rheumatism, trading stories—but her interiority remains thin. The "desperate jocularity" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift toward not feeling lonely lacks causal grounding in prior embodied struggle; it reads as assertion rather than earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear (navigating grief through the stillpoint quest), but his interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic language ("languages he could taste—salt for sorrow, copper for longing") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation—grief "mapped" rather than erased—reads as asserted wisdom rather than earned through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but often filtered through metaphor ("quiet blaze," "shimmering chord") that distances the reader from immediate physical sensation. No true internal conflict complicates his path; he unfolds toward the stillpoint without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority leans heavily toward metaphorical abstraction ("threshed for meaning," "seeds were never wrong") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His core choice—to return to the hydroponic bays—arrives without visible internal conflict or a dramatized trade-off; the anomaly and pen deliver insight, and he accepts it. The "confidently uncertain" trait is asserted in exposition rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a high-stakes beat. Emotional progression is smooth and meditative, lacking the hypocrisy or self-deception that would reveal genuine flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias and Liora are tracked across two distinct actions (mapping silence, confronting the faceless stranger), but interiority remains abstract and label-driven. "Hunger," "quiet kind that made people lean in," and "charisma sharpening into something dangerous" are told without embodied micro-choices. The ending gesture (*we remembered them back*) is asserted rather than earned through prior contradiction or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is established early and his final choice to burn the ledger carries cost, but the arc relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure. The self-portrait wound and decade of guilt are told more than shown through micro-choices. Interior contradiction exists (saving vs. destroying) but most reflection summarizes past states rather than forcing present trade-offs. The archivist remains abstract—a memory prop rather than a relationship under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation is clearly rooted in her experience as a "subject" of the treatment, and the piece offers embodied emotion through her physical interaction with the lagoon. Her progression from passive vault to active releaser shows agency, though the inner conflict between drowning and shaping feels more declared than dramatically contradictory in scene. The treatment-as-theft premise drives her choice to sabotage and ultimately release the memories, but the final turn lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path—she gains freedom without on-page cost to self or consequence from the doctors.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interiority shows concrete observation (the walk-reading skill) and embodied tension (coin-rubbing, goggles adjustment), but the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final third. The grandmother's coin philosophy and the "key with no apparent lock" metaphor feel imported rather than arising from Lior's lived experience. The woman challenger appears too late to pressure genuine internal contradiction; Lior's choice to proceed feels inevitable rather than costly. Motivation is present but the arc lacks visible forfeiture—what does Lior give up by stepping through?

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's motivation is legible through gesture and choreography rather than interiority, maintaining consistency with her silent stance. The boy's shame is embodied through trembling hands and breath hitching, though the father remains off-page until the epilogue addition. The guardian's renunciation of speech and her wait-pattern read as earned stasis with visible cost (isolation, namelessness). Minor slip: "spiralingly calm" appears as a label without constraining a specific choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core motivation is clear—saving the library through creative rebellion—and his chess-coach discipline shapes his tactical approach. The interior is concrete ("iron filings in his palm," "cracked spectacles") and the micro-choices (slipping notes, coordinating displays) feel character-specific. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped; he moves smoothly through his plan without visible hesitation or competing impulses, and the final micro-choice ("smiled") carries minimal cost or contradiction. The embodied tension at closure ("listened," "smiled") lacks the layered ambiguity that would lift this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (seeking freedom through embracing transformation) is clear and embodied through his physical choices—climbing the pier, diving without hesitation—but his internal conflict is underdeveloped. The transformation reads as inevitable rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The dockworkers function as witnesses rather than applying immediate pressure. The scrimshaw operates as a key but Elias's relationship to it (theft, warmth, "guarded as the pirate's treasure") remains more asserted than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interior is specific and embodied—stillness as "a remade hush pressed into the bones," the knife whittling "without thought." Her final scream and crooked smile feel earned, not declared. The past-performer detail grounds her impulse to narrate and her ultimate refusal to perform grief. Harkin's flat affect and micro-gestures (grunt as affection) provide relational pressure, though his arc is sketched rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation is clear and anchored in the seventeen-year banishment, but her interiority trends toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she touches the quartz and lets it "rewrite her" lacks the visceral cost or micro-choice that would ground transformation in scene. Her final stance—"no longer afraid"—is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The piece earns points for consistent voice and a credible arc from poet to boundary-dissolver, but misses the contradictory texture that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is given a clear perceptual signature (colorblind, plant-language user) and his choices drive the story forward. The relationship with Liora develops through concrete micro-choices (the dandelion, the wilting marigold). However, the old woman's transactions feel convenient rather than earned, and Elias's emotional progression from fear of silence to confident playing lacks embodied contradiction under pressure—he moves smoothly through beats without genuine internal friction that would raise the final choice's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is present and her interiority shows some texture ("the space between the notes"), but key moments rely on label-speak ("the texture of connection," "powerfully gentle") without embodied contradiction. The climactic discovery—"she was the connection"—reads as assertion rather than earned through dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is suggested but not shown acting simultaneously in scene; her progression feels contemplative rather than driven by competing impulses with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's grief-driven craft work is embodied through wire-twisting and needle-pricking, with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) acting simultaneously. The mentor's voice and the artificial flower lesson earn her shift from burial to illumination. However, the winter coda's teaching role arrives via summary rather than a dramatized final choice with visible cost. The paraphrase loop ("Grief, she realized, was not a thing to be buried in metal. It was a stencil, a coordinate, a folded promise") flattens what should be the peak realization into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is given a distinct trait ("steadily curious") and an occupation, but his choices feel more atmospheric than pressured. The visitor's confession about her brother provides a moment of human connection, yet Elias's response—handing her the tape—reads as a gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. Interior contradiction is minimal; he operates as a knowing oracle rather than a character struggling under genuine constraint. The micro-choices (dealing cards, measuring printouts) serve mood more than they foreclose paths or reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is built from lyric fragments rather than causally linked choices. Her "method" (resisting repetition) is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation—letting the pagoda crumble—feels abstractly declared ("To purify is to let go") without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option that would give the choice weight. Embodied emotion is sparse; most affect arrives as metaphor ("atoms of nostalgia") rather than perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior trait as a "dusk noticer" is established through concrete perception ("exact moment day surrendered to night") and drives her recognition of the shadow phenomenon. Her decision to trade her shadow shows character-driven agency with visible cost ("her shadow thin but present"). However, the curator's motivations remain sketchy, and Liora's shift from observer to participant feels somewhat abrupt; the internal contradiction between her "half-empty" state and her ability to make such a decisive trade lacks embodied tension in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is grounded in contradictory impulses—gentleness versus con-artist past—and his choices accumulate weight through the three-layered reconstruction ritual. Interiority is mostly concrete ("the fragile conviction that he could outrun his past"), though the child-with-fever flashback edges toward emotional summary rather than embodied cost. The final choice to step forward earns the stance shift, but the climactic moment ("It wasn't forgiveness. It was balance") flirts with diagnostic label-speak that slightly dulls immediacy. Minor deduction for overly articulated self-awareness in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior is richly embodied—the scar "pulsed when the plants whispered," breath fogging glass—but her agency remains observational until the final beat. The motivating contradiction (seeking closure for others while hollow herself) is established early and pays off when she writes on her mother's file, yet that climactic choice arrives without visible cost or friction; she simply "let[s] the scar...ache without trying to decode it." The final renunciation (carrying rather than reading stories) feels thematically tidy rather than earned through on-page struggle. Minor: "accidentally telepathic" reads as label-only until the plants show her the dandelion memory, which does tilt her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured with embodied contradictions—her palm on cold glass, breath fogging it, fingers tracing paths—yet her arc relies heavily on psychometric readings rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final shift ("some love wasn't unused. / It was just waiting") arrives as a stated insight rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The body and gesture work is strong, but the closure renunciation lacks the concrete forfeiture the rubric demands.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Liora's motivation to "free trapped creativity" is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. The protagonist functions as a vessel for cosmic forces; her agency peaks when she "begins to sing" and sketches equations, but these actions feel summoned by the archway rather than earned through internal contradiction. The final success (paintings sell, music makes strangers weep) is declared off-page without visible cost during the closure beat. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "moonstruck dreamer," "creativity she'd trapped in her ribs like a caged bird," and the epiphany that she "had become the path" arrives as assertion rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hollow's interior life is presented through evocative images (holding a breath, feeling a dream stir) but his motivations remain largely atmospheric rather than grounded in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The spark-placement choice arrives without prior internal conflict to earn it; we observe resonant moments but lack the embodied struggle that would elevate the final act. The "never dreamed" frame bookends nicely but doesn't constrain choices in between. Interiority leans poetic rather than character-particular, with phrases like "fractured lullaby" and "divergent archive" feeling more authorial than Hollow's own lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, only poetic assertions ("he laughed, because the sound...wasn't his"). The final shift ("no longer needed to wander") is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of metaphysical labels without character-particular texture or stakes-driven thought.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in the star imprint moment and the final gesture of releasing the punch. The shift from ferry guide to vigil-keeper is earned through prior causality, with visible cost (forfeiting her role, releasing the tool). Internal contradiction appears in "I never left" versus the acknowledgment that she left every time she punched a ticket. Minor deduction: the other vigil-keepers remain underdeveloped, serving primarily as chorus rather than applying immediate pressure, though the woman with braids does offer one meaningful exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias functions primarily as observer with minimal on-page motivation driving his choices until the final act. His numb arm serves as recurring embodied detail and the final decision to hand over the bolt shows contradictory impulses (safety vs. truth), but the interiority remains thin—he "understood" and "thought of" rather than wrestling with competing desires in scene. The pianist's sewn lips and burn scars are vivid, but his presence is largely symbolic; no genuine friction between the two characters emerges. The backstory about the "unpardonable silence" incident is told rather than dramatized, and Elias's twenty-year tenure as bellhop is asserted without showing how that history shapes his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veythas is embodied through his diminutive stature and obstinate authority, with clear motivation (unmask the pretender) driving his 300-year wait and final act. The sacrifice of Lirien's name is dramatized with visible cost—he whispers it into the dark, the library shatters, and he gathers "the last remnants of a kingdom that had died quietly." Internal contradiction surfaces in his long ignoring of warnings versus his immediate knowledge that Lirien left them, though the choice to act feels slightly compressed rather than fully wrestled. The final renunciation (walking out after carving the epitaph) closes the arc with earned stasis and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's motivation is coherent and embodied through the tapping ritual and her assembling of fragments. Her grandmother's teachings provide a believable foundation for the final choice to follow the road. The ending choice feels earned, though the walk into the water lacks visible internal conflict or contradiction in the moment itself. Voss remains functional but one-dimensional, serving mainly as opposition without his own pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to discover meaning is legible and her barefoot choices recur, but her internal contradiction remains largely asserted ("awkward confidence") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The scout's hollow-to-hungry shift at the end is vivid but his role is brief; the rebellion's collective agency late in the piece blurs individual cost. Embodied emotion is strong in her laugh and grip on the glasses, yet the stakes-raising choice feels more discovered than wrestled from competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivations are clear and embodied—her hands testing heat, brushing sand, pressing the pendant. Internal conflict between tradition and evolution drives visible choices (replanting the grove "not as it was"). However, the grandson and Council elder feel token; their shifts (grandson admits "You were right," elder's voice "wavered") arrive without earned causality. The ending renunciation lacks visible cost—Liora laughs, smiles, and the people simply listen without dramatized resistance or personal sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's embodied grief is vivid—the crumpled photograph, the somatic freeze technique, palms pressed into thighs—and her progression from freezing time to pruning deadwood tracks a credible internal shift. The therapist's maxim ("You don't have to let go. You have to make room.") works diagnostically but teeters on the edge of label-speak; the final act (plucking the leaf, returning to prune) rescues it by grounding the insight in concrete action. Internal contradiction appears in the want/need tension (erasing loss vs. anchoring to persistence), and the micro-choices (releasing the photograph, choosing the leaf) feel earned. Minor deduction: the "quietly talented once" attribute remains asserted rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is largely atmospheric declaration rather than embodied contradiction. Her "decision" to descend and redesign the box arrives as poetic assertion without prior visible resistance or trade-off; the character dissolves into metaphor at the closure beat. The transformation to "canvas" reads label-only, lacking a micro-choice that forecloses a concrete path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's albino tracking ability is established through action (tracing cracks, reading ink patterns), and his pursuit shows consistent motivation. The backstory about his sister and the three-day vanishing provides stakes, though it's told rather than dramatized. Internal contradiction appears in his shift from hunter to seeker of understanding, but this feels more like a conceptual pivot than embodied struggle—the decision to follow "not to kill" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. The final choice lacks the micro-hesitation or trade-off that would make the renunciation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to expose the truth is signaled early and her final act carries weight, but her interior life leans heavily on stock thriller beats ("pulse scandalized the stillness," "hands shake"). The phrase "bravely conflicted" appears as meta-label rather than dramatized contradiction in scene. The closing smile and "I've just remembered" land as posed rather than embodied under lethal pressure, diminishing the cost's emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory anchors—pressing thorns, tasting the sandbag, listening to roots—and her contradiction between inheritance (father's violence-to-peace arc) and her own choice to anchor rather than flee creates genuine internal tension. The choice to stay with the roses over escape is dramatized through micro-actions (sheathing the knife, knotting the scrap) that foreclose a path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the father's voice and lessons dominate reflection heavily, occasionally flattening Liora's own perceptual signature into inherited maxims rather than her lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fisher's cool-headed resolve is demonstrated through consistent embodied restraint ("didn't flinch," "exhaled, slow and measured"), and his choices accumulate toward the final renunciation—letting the echo go. Internal conflict appears primarily in the backstory with his daughter, but present-beat contradictory impulses are limited; the protagonist moves through the garden's violence with steady composure rather than layered ambivalence. The final act of letting go reads as earned by the thirty-year hunt and the rail spike's completion, though the cost remains mostly implied rather than viscerally dramatized in present sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lydia's internal conflict is dramatized through concrete choices—picking up the pen, writing the new ledger, descending to meet the stranger—with clear motive rooted in her parents' legacies. The contradictory pull between burying the story and exposing it operates simultaneously in her hesitation and final commitment, embodied through handling the pen nib and ledgers. Minor slip: the "devotedly observant" trait is labeled more than it constrains a specific choice with visible cost. The final decision to publish is earned by prior causality and forecloses the orbit of regret with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation around guilt is palpable and embodied through the tattoo work and amber handling. However, the time-fold scene lacks clear psychological throughline—her decision to "reach for the baby" feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior contradiction. The firmware's effect on her interiority is told more than shown acting on micro-choices. Internal conflict exists but doesn't drive enough on-page friction to enter the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's perceptual signature is established early ("socially perceptive in the way of those who'd spent lifetimes watching others pretend"), but his interiority leans abstract rather than contradictory-impulses-in-scene. The closure choice—plunging his hand into the mandala—feels motivated by his character, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Emotional progression is present (pulse stutters, breath hitches) but remains gestural; the final stance crystallization ("Always") feels earned but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the Mender identity, grief as weapon, surgical precision in hands—but the commander's sudden pivot feels under-motivated; we see his sword waver and fall, then kneeling, without sufficient prior cues to earn that shift. The final image of shared sorrow works emotionally, yet the commander's arc compresses a likely complex history into a single beat without visible internal contradiction beforehand. Embodied emotion is strong in Elias (calloused fingers, thumb pressure, breath fogging), and the renunciation of vengeance for "holding" is credible, but the secondary character's transformation arrives too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lydia's interiority shows embodied contradiction—the "itch in the bones" and her positioning as "never the star" versus her persistent stage hunger. The synesthesia trait remains largely decorative ("taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin's first trembling note") without constraining her choices under pressure. Elias arrives mid-story with minimal agency; his shift from despair to forward motion lacks visible internal struggle or micro-choices that would make the change earned on the page. The final renunciation (Lydia fading, knowing she'll return) carries some cost but the protagonist's arc feels more like repetition of an established pattern than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to follow Mira is clear and rooted in affection rather than revenge, but her interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The key decision—pressing the sliver to her temple—arrives without sufficient on-page resistance or visible cost that would foreclose other paths. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("fingers twitching," "breath hitched") but is diluted by abstract phrasing like "texture of longing" and metaphoric distancing. The final choice to paint rather than follow lacks the earned tension that would force a genuine tradeoff between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lior's motivation to become "the voice of the unknown" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior experience relies heavily on abstract tech readouts (heat-mapped emotions as violet/gold/crimson) rather than embodied sensation. The final choice—speaking to the cave—feels unmotivated by prior causality; no on-page struggle or trade-off precedes the moment when "the fossil lifted from their palm." Backstory about the Great Hibernation and stasis councils remains inert exposition rather than tilting present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—recovering the ninth button to prevent the hourglass from shattering—and his interior voice carries consistent texture ("hourglass turner," "his tool and his burden"). However, the final realization ("The hourglass doesn't break. We do.") arrives as an epiphany without embodied struggle; the moment he threads the button and whispers the traveler's words reads more as ritual than contradictory choice under pressure. The traveler's face in the button and the prophecy mechanics remain abstract, limiting felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's internal contradiction between prudence and daring is embodied in on-page micro-choices (keeping the pillbox, opening it, pocketing the key). The burns and their emotional weight ground her embodied history, and the final decision to step forward forecloses her exit with visible cost. Minor deduction: the ally's brief appearance lacks distinct pressure beyond delivering exposition; his presence functions more as catalyst than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's motivation is embodied through his decade of listening and the physical anchor of the parchment, and his final understanding of the needle as key demonstrates earned interiority. The girl's micro-choices—stilling her needle, speaking "Wait," pressing the object into his palm—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (leaving her mother). Minor slip: the merchant remains functional pressure only, without distinct interior contradiction, and the girl's silent watchfulness could be more actively contradictory earlier to fully earn the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter's phototropism to kindness is asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His decision to embed the glass and leave the bowl shows intention but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would earn the gesture. Interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("his mind unspooled the fractured timelines") rather than embodied, character-specific thought under pressure. The final understanding arrives as gentle realization rather than through struggle that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and embodied—blood pressed into soil, hands quivering, the gauge tooth as both tool and unlocking metaphor. Her arc from isolation to tentative hope is earned through micro-choices (whispering to plants, accepting Elias's second gauge) rather than declared epiphany. Elias remains slightly under-realized; his motives and internal conflict are gestured at but not fully dramatized. The relationship deepens credibly, but Elias's scarred knuckles and night-watchman role function more as symbolic shorthand than individuated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's internal state is present through embodied perception (damp pages, hum that makes teeth ache) and his reflective questions to the bird show genuine seeking rather than declaration. The isolation-to-independence arc is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal value hierarchies under pressure; the final smile and door-opening feel asserted as transformation rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The Hesperornis functions more as symbolic catalyst than as a character applying pressure that forces Lior's hand, weakening the "relationships as crucible" dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's internal landscape is rendered through concrete choices—keeping draft letters, bringing the twig spiral, finally releasing her own spiral—but her interior reasoning remains somewhat abstract ("secrets were meant to be rejoined"). The micro-choices at the installation are present, though the stakes feel muted; her motivation to release the spirals lacks visceral resistance or embodied cost. The dream sequence at the end reads as symbolic summary rather than lived contradiction. Interiority relies on thematic assertion more than character-particular texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior is concrete and embodied ("thumb hovered," "cautiously hopeful heart pounding"), with professional competence balanced by isolation and doubt. Her agency drives the key choice to transmit the counter-signal, foreclosing her academic safety with visible cost. However, the protagonist's arc feels somewhat passive in the middle—she calibrates and watches reactions rather than making multiple on-page choices under contradictory pressures. The final beat ("the universe was still talking. And now, so was she") lands as intention rather than a fully earned renunciation with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is embodied with claustrophobia ("He was not built for tight spaces," "His lungs tightened") that constrains action and shapes his descent. His final choice—driving the key into the table while under threat—creates closure with visible cost ("pocketed it, its point now warm as a pulse"). Interior texture is specific ("the only honest thing left in this crooked world"), though peak moments lean on stock phrasing ("the weight lighter than the old fear in his ribs"). The change from fear to understanding is earned, though the father's inheritance motif does most of the lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's face-blindness and sensory compensations are well-established, and his methodical approach shows through concrete actions (lance, texture-tracing). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between buried empathy and his role as witness, though the final choice—walking toward the child's cough—feels somewhat gestural rather than earned by on-page struggle. The backstory with Liora is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (ribbon, quarry space) and tilts his current stance. Embodied emotion is present ("his methodical heart a little less still") but some moments drift toward abstract label-speak ("the weight of what he couldn't see").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to redeem his great-grandfather reads clearly and his internal contradiction between duty and obsession is embodied in his sprint toward the Maw despite the alarms. However, the shift from map-librarian passivity to decisive action at the observation deck lacks intermediate micro-choices that would earn the turn. Liora's "nervous confidence" is told twice but never dramatized in contradictory behavior under pressure. The final reflection on Orin as "not a coward" lands as thematic summary rather than earned insight through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has consistent traits (fiddler, observer, someone who knows the hitchhiker's kind) and makes the pivotal choice to step through at the end. His interiority is often vivid ("dynamically observant gaze," sensory processing of the glass flake), but the final transformation into "the song" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The cost of stepping through is implied but not viscerally rendered; we don't see what he's leaving behind or the weight of foreclosing his old life.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("fear was just another kind of currency"), and his final choice to leave the lira behind shows earned renunciation. However, the key turning choice—deciding not to wonder what comes next—arrives through extended meditation rather than pressured contradiction in scene. The father remains a motivating echo rather than an on-page presence applying relationship pressure. Internal conflict is present but operates sequentially through reflection rather than simultaneously under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is atmospheric but often abstracted—"lucid dream chronicler" remains a label without clear constraints on his choices. The shift from recording to joining the "chorus" is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His embodied responses (breath fogging glass, pressing telegram to lips) provide texture, but the final change reads as realization-by-metaphor rather than a choice forged under pressure. The sister's absence functions more as thematic backdrop than a relationship under pressure that forces a micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eldrin's motivation is clear and grounded in personal loss, driving his choice to plant the seed. The interiority carries a consistent dark/searching quality ("wasn't mercy...to see what the lake's mirror refused to show"), and his final choice to pocket the key and walk away is earned by the revealed truth. However, the brother's transformation from boy to beast and the confession that he "jumped" arrive without enough embodied emotional cost on Eldrin's part—his reaction is too controlled, too philosophically distanced ("the weight of knowing pressing him flatter") rather than contradictory or viscerally raw.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's choices drive the narrative (entering the maze, pressing the clipping to her scar, running across the bridge), but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Phrases like "purposefully curious hands" and "dreams that had clawed at her ribs" feel more like atmospheric labels than lived internal conflict. The final transformation ("scars glowed, the pain transmuting into something like flight") asserts change without dramatizing the foreclosed path or visible cost that would earn it. Motivation remains coherent but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation ("patch the holes in her soul") is dramatized through concrete action—stitching the card into bark, trading her hidden guilt. Her final choice to take something back (accepting scars rather than filling holes) emerges from the orchard's pull and her willingness to barter everything. Internal contradiction appears when she claims recklessness yet executes precision; the text shows her fiercely gentle touch but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat. The embodied pain ("sweet and bright as the first light of dawn") and the quiet eyes at closure earn the renunciation, though the epiphany risks arriving fully formed rather than accumulating through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liam's interiority is embodied and specific—the widow's trembling hands, his cataloging impulse as emotional armor—and his micro-choices (pocketing the cloth, declining to change the station) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction emerges through simultaneous impulses: "confidently uncertain" is shown via his professional appraisal voice clashing with hollow self-worth. The final choice to keep the scrap forecloses the path of pure monetary valuation with visible cost (rejecting professional detachment). Minor: some reflective passages edge toward summary rather than dramatized struggle, and the widow's microphones function more as prompt than live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with embodied moments like pausing hands and throat tightening. His interior state is specific ("analogical thinking" as both craft and coping mechanism), and the final choice—reaching for the flower—foregrounds agency. However, the emotional progression relies on therapeutic label-speak at key beats ("the spirit had never been a ghost. It had been a *hypothesis*") that flattens crisis interiority, and the wife-reunion closure lacks contradiction or visible cost on the page; he simply accepts the doubled state without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias shows character-specific perception (the moon's pull affecting his bones, the ledger work), and his interior voice is consistent—but his agency is passive observation until the woman arrives. The smelting action feels like craft-work performed for another's request rather than his own stake-driven choice. The woman's motivation (wanting to stir tea with "almost") is poetic but never embodied in concrete need or cost, leaving both characters more conceptual than psychologically grounded. Internal contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure is absent; Elias smoothly completes the task without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inspector's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("electric air," "resonant hush") without embodied specificity. The final transformation—she "learns how to shine"—reads as label-only epiphany without a micro-choice that earns it. The shells' confessions are compelling, but the protagonist remains a vessel for mystical forces rather than an agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is embodied through concrete actions—tracing maps, squeezing bellows, walking—and his interior state (fog vs. clarity, guilt over his sister) drives his journey without diagnosis-speak. The medication decision and move toward the bridge show contradictory impulses (method vs. grief, refusal vs. need) acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "daringly methodical" arrives as a sister's quote rather than demonstrated through on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure, though the walk and bellows handling support it. The ending choice (turning right) forecloses the mapped path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dreamer's agency is present but shadowed by heavy symbolic layering; her internal contradictions remain implied rather than dramatized in scene. Key micro-choices—climbing the ladder, tearing the page, writing the third letter—show motive, but the pivot from "finding what was unsaid" to "learning to say it" arrives through summary rather than on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is intermittent: "pulse quickened," "hands trembling" register physically, but much of the interiority floats in abstract register ("heart no longer a cipher"). The final act of writing and posting earns the change only if we accept the library epiphany as sufficient causality.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are coherent—the contract versus preservation conflict—and embodied through her hesitation over the violin, her gift's burden shown via the wisteria exchange. Her decision to shatter the instrument feels earned by the accumulating plant voices and Silas's embedded message. However, the final kneeling tableau edges toward performative closure; the internal contradiction between freedom-purchase and propagation could have been sharpened in one additional micro-choice earlier to deepen the renunciation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's profession anchors her watchful stance, and the choice to reach through the threshold is motivated by her mortician's attunement to stillness. However, interiority leans toward abstract poeticism ("the parts of her that still remembered how to listen") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision feels contemplative rather than agonistic, with no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that charges the moment with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—grief scallops joy, forgiveness carved a hollow—and her final choice (giving the silver fruit) flows from prior causality. The man's dove-release and shaking hands embody his state without label-speak. Minor slip: the grotto's voice asking "What do you seek?" feels slightly convenient, though Maren's answer ("Not peace") reveals contradiction. Internal conflict and embodied emotion sustain pressure through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to release borrowed guilt is dramatized through the unhooking action and yields concrete cost (dissolving threads, releasing confessions). Internal contradiction operates clearly: his role as guilt-absorber versus his need for personal clarity. The woman's late arrival feels convenient—she announces "I'm here to help you carry yours" without prior setup, which weakens the earned quality of his shift. Embodied emotion is present (trembling fingers, breath hitched) but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("welcome nuance into certainty") in the final third dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to teach vanishing remains abstract and never faces concrete on-page pressure that forces a choice with visible cost. The backward-aging mechanic is mentioned but never constrains a decision or creates friction; his body shifts from sixty-three to sixty-two without altering tactics or stakes. Interiority relies heavily on memory sequences (grandfather's orchard, sycamore childhood) that consume ~25% of the text without anchoring in present micro-choices that tilt his stance. The student remains off-page, reducing relational pressure to zero.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The skimmer's interior is present through embodied sensing (arrowhead vibrations, breath control) and the final stance crystallization—becoming stone rather than fleeing—feels earned by the constraint. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("pulse left wandering," "anchor") without concrete micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The protagonist's competence is asserted through lineage and mystic ability rather than shown struggling against genuine limits; the Hollow Maw threat is resolved through stillness without visible cost beyond waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlin's motivation is clearly rooted in his failure and the candle's whisper, with his final choice to walk away from praise showing earned character work. However, interiority relies heavily on declarative summary ("He wasn't here for redemption") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The keeper's unfinished edges and Marlin's recognition of "lingering luminance" carry specificity, but the protagonist's internal arc feels more told than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The closing beat—whispering "Louder" to the flame—lands with appropriate defiance, though the emotional progression from exile to mastery-rejection could be more granular.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's obsession with the color of sound is established early and drives him into the wreck, but his interior life remains diffuse—reading waterlogged journals and wandering feel more like atmospheric gestures than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic choice to light his own lantern and "sign" a vow lacks embodied cost; we see him pocket a key and strike flint, but the stakes of renunciation or what path is foreclosed remain abstract. The faceless figure's declaration that "the color of sound isn't found—it's made" lands as an epiphany delivered rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is vivid in places ("his pulse thrumming in his throat") but drifts into label-only metaphor ("cobalt despair, amber longing") without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear—interpret the prophecy—but her internal experience remains abstract. The "quietly enthusiastic about patterns" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost. The decision to "let the frequency pull her apart" lacks embodied resistance or contradictory impulses; she moves through the transformation without struggle. The ending hints at cost ("the choice to turn around") but the emotional price remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's contradiction—heartbroken yet hollow, collecting fears to give them shape—is clearly embodied. His micro-choices (pressing fears into monsters, walking toward the next town despite regret) alter present options and foreclose paths. However, the climactic act of crystallizing and naming fears happens rapidly without visible struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in the scene; the internal conflict is told through summary ("He already did") rather than dramatized tension. The final renunciation (carrying on despite knowing the cost) is earned but the embodiment of that choice lacks contradictory impulses wrestling on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's characterization is consistent and his devotion drives his choices on the page. The internal drive to right the imbalance is clear, and his "lukewarm mage" status creates grounded vulnerability. However, the villagers' judgment is told rather than dramatized through a specific interaction, and the final sleeping tableau undercuts agency at closure. Embodied emotion is present ("hands trembled," "breath hitched") but lapses into generic at peaks ("heart lighter than the air").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior arc is concrete—his desire to "feed" the reservoir shifts to "let it breathe," and embodied gestures (kneeling, nailing photographs, lighting them) anchor the change. The contradiction between guarding and grieving is felt, and his micro-choices (withdrawing photos one by one, lighting them) foreclose the path of silent hoarding. Minor deduction: the phrase "sapphire-hued liqueur his mother had once distilled" reads expository rather than anchored in lived memory, and "the reservoir's hunger" risks abstraction. The ending earns renunciation through causal pressure—twenty years of warning versus one night of release—but the mother's "forgiveness neither of them had ever voiced" edges toward diagnostic labeling without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical statements rather than embodied emotion under pressure. Her "secretly sentimental" trait is told ("she'd spent a lifetime disguising it as rigor") but never tested on the page through a choice with visible cost. The final transformation sequence lacks contradictory impulses; she simply "wouldn't resist it," which reads as capitulation rather than earned agency. The micro-choices (striking flint, tilting the crystal) are present but their emotional weight remains asserted rather than dramatized through bodily specificity or competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is character-specific with concrete embodied detail: "her fingers tracing the grooves" and "her breath hitched, not from fear but from the burden of knowing." The mentor relationship establishes prior causality for her skill and the buckle's significance. The final renunciation—walking away without answering the radio—demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (isolation, perpetual burden). Minor deduction: the "midnight pattern seeker" label feels ornamental rather than constraining on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—merging the split halves of his mind to defeat numbness—and the final action shows decisive cost. However, the internal contradiction remains largely told rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The jar-touching gestures and blood ritual work physically, but the embodied emotion feels more declarative ("crushing, glorious *all* of it") than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Veyra's presence applies pressure but her role tilts toward witness rather than crucible that forces Kael's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to restore laughter is clear and embodied through his tunnel ritual, with the pull cord handle worn smooth from use grounding his obsession. Internal conflict appears ("mournfully eager," the contradiction of coaxing false laughter) but lacks simultaneous pressure in scene—he never wrestles with the futility mid-act until the blower dies. The final shift when he climbs to join the household feels under-earned; no prior micro-choice dramatizes his readiness to stop conducting, making the turn more declared than discovered. The hourglass functions as motif but doesn't constrain a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyssa's interior voice carries consistent particularity—the aching teeth, the slippery time—and her final choice to hand over the pendant is earned by accumulated longing. However, the figure's nature remains abstract ("stretched between," "edges blurring"), reducing the relational pressure that might have forced harder trade-offs. The laugh at terror feels psychologically specific, but the dissolution into "vast, breathing page" abstracts the embodied cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—exile from the guild and pursuit of vivification—and his arc of feeding the crozier memories and doubt embodies internal contradiction. However, key moments rely on label-only interiority: "gnawing certainty," "exact pitch of the guildmaster's sigh," and especially the final beat where his hands move with "stoic sensitivity" without showing how that manifests in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The transformation at closure reads more asserted than earned through visible, embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior voice carries distinct texture ("serenely electric," the unlearning approach), but her final leap reads as unmotivated by prior causality—gravity reversal arrives without setup or earned cost. The mentor's teaching is told rather than shown shaping a present micro-choice. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from doubt to laughter without embodied struggle, and the jump feels like concept assertion rather than character-driven necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's characterization relies heavily on archetype (the knowing, unfazed guide through impossible terrain) and her competence never wavers under pressure. The gesture of feeding moments to the hourglass over years establishes history, but her interior lacks contradiction—she grins, adjusts, whispers names, all without visible cost or doubt. The final choice to "merge the lanes" feels like execution of expertise rather than a decision that forecloses a path; no live alternative is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior is detailed but too evenly articulated under pressure—his reflections about his mother's postcard and the gallery's purpose remain measured and philosophical rather than embodied and contradictory. The woman in gray functions as a conceptual mirror rather than a distinct character with her own pressure; their exchange feels more like thematic dialogue than interpersonal friction. The ending choice ("Again?") lacks visible cost; we never see what Elias forfeits by continuing this cycle, and the sinew thread "reforming in his pocket" reads as a soft reset rather than a path foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's motivation to learn alien navigation is clear and intensifies through the story, with her "balancedly curious" trait driving her forward. Her micro-choices—placing the chain link, teaching Kael, drawing the star map—advance the stakes. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract; phrases like "realizing it had been looking the wrong way its entire life" and "the horizon wasn't a line—it was a spiral" feel more thematic than embodied. The final choice to teach is earned but lacks visible internal contradiction or cost that would charge the moment with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. duty, listening vs. witnessing—that act simultaneously in scene. The trait "persistent curiosity" is labeled but not meaningfully embodied through micro-choices under pressure; it's told rather than dramatized in the atrium beats. The final moment where he "answers" the voice offers a stance shift, but the progression from kneeling recognition to resuming work feels more like emotional arithmetic than earned cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("Curiosity had always been his undoing") without grounding in concrete embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or embodied cost. His claustrophobia is mentioned early but never constrains a choice or complicates his descent—he simply proceeds. The internal texture leans heavily on abstract poetic assertions ("the weight of the invisible light in his bones") rather than micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses. The final decision to return feels declared rather than forged through visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation is consistent—fixing errors, seeking patterns in static—and her attachment to the porcelain shard grounds her. However, her agency at closure is passive: the "digital ghost" offers, and she accepts without meaningful internal conflict or cost visible in her choices. The heartbeat-counting trait is mentioned but never constrains a decision. The final smile and "ready to listen" posture feel unearned; no prior contradiction or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    Veyra's drive to translate the dying language is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—we see "copper-veined" traits and "the hunger that had driven her ancestors" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in the moment. The key turn ("She should have stopped then. But…") reads as a declaration rather than a dramatized struggle with visible cost on the page. The ending forecloses her path, but the reader traces the closure more through summary ("tried to run," "tried to harness") than through immediate, embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation (bitterness as religion, hunting his sister's abductor) is declared but never tested through concrete on-page choice; he picks up the arrowhead and then is acted upon by garden, phone, and herbalist without meaningful agency until a final passive surrender. The "choice" to "let the joke rewrite him" is asserted, not dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost—no action sequence shows what he gives up or how prior motives collapse. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves from bitter researcher to absorbed-by-garden without embodied struggle, and the metamorphosis happens to him rather than through a decision that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The violinist's interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied—"her fingers finally still" and "she had remembered how to listen" read as assertions rather than lived contradiction. The progression from playing to stepping down to final music lacks concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; the character executes a pre-determined arc without friction. Motivation is told through thematic statements ("the thing inside her own chest that had also been waiting to break free") rather than shown through bodily hesitation or tactical adjustment. The statues' transformation and the violinist's agency remain parallel tracks that never force a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation (delivering storm, testing drone gaps) with embodied tension ("chest ached," scar). Internal contradiction appears when he calls himself "respectfully rebellious" versus "terrible smuggler"—a verbal formula rather than dramatized conflict. Lira remains functional but thin; her trembling fingers and dry laugh show character-particular gesture, yet her arc (sorting letters, releasing storm, vanishing by dawn) reads as a symbolic echo rather than a pressure-driven choice. The final choice to keep delivering feels asserted rather than costly; we don't see what he forfeits or what path closes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's silence is established as character-rooted rather than convenient, and his hands-first approach to meaning-making feels consistent. The woman's presence remains abstract—no embodied fear, hunger, or contradictory impulse beyond the song. The final "offering" of silence reads as a declared epiphany rather than a choice under pressure with visible cost, and the shift to hand-shaping melody arrives without prior setup or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation—reaching into hyperbolic space to reawaken his mother's memory—drives the ritual. His micro-choices (anchoring the scarf with specific books, reading the silences) feel character-particular. However, the final shift from lonely to "a fold in the story" arrives through declaration rather than a pivot that forecloses a visible path; the cost remains conceptual and the renunciation of hoarding is told more than dramatized in a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian's motivation to vitalize dreams is present but operates at an abstract level; her hesitation ("The dream was beautiful here, untethered") reads as thematic meditation rather than embodied conflict between contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "press the photograph to her chest" and whisper "Stay" lacks visible cost—we don't see what path is foreclosed or what she sacrifices by refusing to return the dream to the library. Her embodied emotion remains thin: "breath hitched" and generic gestures replace the specific physical signature of someone wrestling with a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("the space between the strands, where the idea of freedom had been trapped"), and the reflective block on her mother/locket anchors a present micro-choice to open the ribbon. However, the man remains functionally flat—his "moth-eaten coat" and snarled demand are gestural shorthand without contradictory impulses. The final choice (pressing the map's center, telling him to "Go") feels more conceptual than embodied with visible cost; the locksmith smiles "unassumingly bold" in summary rather than through a dramatized tradeoff that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to recover stolen memories drives clear choices (using the fairy ring, whispering the word for "remember"), and his internal conflict between chasing the past and recognizing the gaps as "spaces held open" is embodied. The interiority carries specific texture ("crisp ache of a space where feeling *should* be"), though the sailor's dementia dismissal feels convenient rather than a genuine blind spot that compounds. The final confrontation with the memory eater wearing a friend's face arrives abruptly without prior setup, weakening the earned weight of that recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elspeth's interiority is concrete and contradictory—her "combative tenderness" manifests in micro-choices like pressing the mirror shard into Kael's palm. The apprentice's trembling hands and doubt are embodied rather than labeled. The arc from fear to annotation-work is earned through prior demonstration, and Elspeth's final withholding ("the cost of coming back") adds consistent complexity. Minor slip: Kael's mother is mentioned but never pressures the scene directly, reading as setup without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior landscape shows purposeful constraint—his "hunger... to shape the unseen" drives the seed-planting choice and the veil crossing—but the girl's sharp ribs and fading are told rather than embodied in micro-choices that reveal her stake. The protagonist's final departure carries visible cost (leaving the orchard, accepting "debt"), yet the villagers' sudden eye-shine and the children's instant recognition feel like emotional arithmetic rather than earned contradictory states. Interiority leans on stock metaphor ("calloused hands," "quiet, stubborn roots") without the perceptual signature that would lift it into high credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is richly textured with embodied detail (calloused fingers, the needle's worn eye, threads wound like bracelets) and his core choice—letting the knot unravel rather than fixing it—reverses his restorer identity with visible cost. The piece sustains contradictory impulses (the urge to mend vs. the need to release) acting simultaneously in the sanctuary scene. Minor slips: the woman's voice functions more as thematic echo than pressure-applying character, and the final smile labeled "broken thing, but it fit" edges toward self-commentary rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured through her perceptual lens—measuring "quiet spaces between what was recorded and what was remembered"—and her methodology is character-particular. However, motivation remains primarily told rather than tested: her desire to understand the henge never faces a concrete on-page obstacle or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The final choice to "listen" rather than step through reads more as contemplative stance than dramatic agency that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle under pressure are absent; she moves through discovery without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her analytical nature shapes how she processes the snow globe and Amelia's notebook through observation and connection-building. The sister photograph provides a secondary emotional stake that charges her final "letting go," though the renunciation feels somewhat told rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to file a false report and preserve the mystery is motivated and forecloses a path, but the embodied cost at that exact moment remains slightly abstract. Minor penalty for the therapized framing of "letting go" as a clean psychological arc rather than messier contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The balladeer's motivation to translate silence is established through grandmother's flower press and sustained through encoding actions. Internal contradiction surfaces when he recognizes the ghost wants "into him" and must choose between translation and self-preservation, embodied in the moment his fingers still and he thinks of his grandmother's hands. The final choice—slamming the bolt plate to unravel the ghost—feels earned, though the cost registers more as atmospheric release than visible personal foreclosure. The child waking at the end gestures toward continuation but doesn't deepen the balladeer's own alteration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's inquisitive trait is established and her physical journey is tracked, but interiority remains largely observational rather than decisional under pressure. The final laugh and decision to climb read as a realization rather than a choice that forecloses a meaningful alternative with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (throat tightening, breath fogging) but the arc from scullery maid to servant who "sees clearly" lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The diary owner Vera/Victor functions as a reflective mirror rather than applying direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's internal world is richly textured—grief pooled in atmospheric detail, his poetic method of reading clouds as emotion. However, the piece offers no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he drifts without internal conflict, already resigned to his fall. The final "surrender" reads as confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The artist's contradiction—chasing exactness while denying limits—drives the arc, and her final choice to "paint nothing" forecloses the knife with visible cost. Interiority is image-rich and embodied ("her hands remembered," "her fingers twitching"), though some moments drift into abstraction ("the way a glance could split a life") without grounding in scene pressure. The closing choice reads earned by the night's work, but the pivot from precision to void feels slightly telescoped given the density of prior obsession. Minor label-speak appears ("fractally precise" as guild joke) but stays controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's curiosity drives her investigation and the final choice to lead the crew through the hopscotch sequence, though the captain's immediate willingness to follow feels underprepared—Veyra shifts from "snapped" dismissal to cooperation without visible internal struggle. The crew functions as chorus rather than individuals with competing pressures. Embodied emotion is present (pulse jumped, grinned) but the pivotal moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Liora moves through discovery to solution without significant doubt or cost to her standing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith's motivation is concrete and embodied through her craft—the desire for "that precise *click* when a gear found its mate after years of solitude" anchors her pursuit. Her sister's loss provides clear stakes, and the final action (reaching into the mirror, taking the watch) demonstrates agency with visible cost: she becomes "the key" rather than merely a mender. Internal contradiction surfaces in her shift from repairing mechanisms to becoming part of one, though the transition could be more viscerally conflicted. Minor deduction for the child's appearance feeling slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora's motivation to help is present but underdeveloped; her internal contradiction between arriving as a stranger seeking respite and staying to build is told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Kael's altruistic stance is consistent but edges toward archetype—his dialogue carries subtext, yet his flickering-ghost interiority remains opaque, limiting felt cost. The collective of strangers who stay is functional but largely offstage; their individual stakes never pressure Liora's choices directly. The final "We stay" moment gestures at change but lacks a visible forfeiture or prior live option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to save the world is signaled but remains abstract; his interior life reduces to poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—inserting the puppet head—feels predetermined by the prose's dreamy inevitability rather than earned through visible struggle or trade-off. The cost (his own thread) is asserted but not embodied; we never see him hesitate, doubt, or weigh alternatives in concrete micro-choices. Emotional progression is smooth and elevated throughout, lacking the jagged texture of genuine crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's thirteen-year burden and her incremental choices to guide travelers through nut-placements build a coherent internal contradiction between duty and mercy. The girl's arrival forces a visible micro-choice that reveals Liora's hierarchy of values, and the final act of leaving the last nut embodies renunciation with cost. Interiority remains concrete and embodied throughout ("too sharp, too precise," the nut "warm from her fingers"). Minor deduction: the backstory about the previous caretaker and the fruit's curse reads as efficient setup but flattens slightly into exposition in the opening paragraph without immediate present-frame pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is established through his professional history and grief, with his polymer-chemistry background informing his perception of patterns and connections. The arc from grief-dammed engineer to someone who understands dissolution and flow is earned through on-page observation and the chrysalis ritual. Internal contradiction surfaces in his decade of bridge-building that "never mended what mattered," and the final wading into convergence shows a genuine shift with the cost of letting go his need to atone. The girl functions as external catalyst but her sudden appearance feels slightly convenient; still, Elias's choices drive the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to find "where stories begin" is signaled but remains abstract; her on-page choices (trading moonlight, incising slates) feel observational rather than personally pressured. The patron's hunger is embodied ("eyes flickered, hungry"), yet Liora's internal stakes never materialize as genuine contradiction or cost—she performs her role without visible friction. The final choice to keep moonlight "for the darkness it held" gestures at thematic weight but arrives without prior struggle, making the renunciation feel declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are established (tasting memories, tending grief) and his actions flow from them—traveling to the pavilion, distilling the soldier's memory, smoothing its edges. Internal contradiction appears when he lingers despite urgency ("The kitchen would be waking soon"), showing pull between duty and need. However, the soldier's memory remains abstract; we never see Elias struggle with its specific content in a way that forces a meaningful choice or reveals deeper character contradiction. The final smile and "Not anymore" suggest resolution but feel more like reassurance than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivations are clear—she weaves community harmony through music and language—but her interiority remains somewhat abstract. The scene with Elias shows embodied tension (his flexing hands, the bottle), yet Liora's internal contradictions are muted; her decisiveness feels more asserted than earned through on-page conflict. The shift from confrontation to collaboration happens rapidly without visible cost to her stance. Minor penalty for therapeutic framing ("empathetically decisive") that labels rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena's interiority is vivid and specific ("helix of equations," "cartographer of the entangled dark"), but her motivation to "unfold" memories feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. The backstory blocks (Mars prototypes, lover, child) exceed the reflection budget and flatten present pressure; they anchor via the mirror but don't shift present stance through micro-choices. The final walk reads as acceptance, but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene—she moves from observation to embrace without visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal conflict is told retrospectively rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lysara's prism-mind trait and grief over her brother provide clear motivation, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract description ("prism-mind fractured," "thoughts splintered") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to plant the seed and return as "a key" is signaled but lacks visceral cost on the page—we don't see what she forfeits or what door closes. Micro-choices under pressure (reaching for the jar, cupping the seed) are present but their stakes remain asserted more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is characterized through his embodied perception—hearing stress cracks as music, strumming fissures—and his symphonic mindset shapes micro-choices (pressing the insulator, adjusting grip). Internal contradiction is light: his drive to voice the sculpture's grief is consistent rather than conflicted, and no meaningful renunciation or cost forecloses a path. The final act (leaving the insulator) reads more as completion than change, limiting the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is consistently anchored in the tactile (worry stone dent) and his chess-tutor lens filters perception effectively. His final choice to give the stone away feels earned by the pattern of precise-yet-cautious deliberation established throughout. The girl reads as archetype more than individual—her speech and insight lack the idiom of childhood—and her motivations remain asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Internal contradiction is present in Elias (fear of playing vs. need to translate silence) but the girl's stance never wavers, flattening the relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's core trait—collecting silences—is rendered through concrete action (the device, the diary) and drives his choices. The final turn toward breaking silence feels somewhat abrupt; his lifelong avoidance is summarized rather than shown resisting in scene. The embodied contradiction between empathy-as-listening and the need to act is present but could be sharpened through micro-choices that test his philosophy before the ending pivot. Interior voice is consistent and particular, avoiding therapeutic language.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation is concrete and embodied through her olfactory sensitivity, driving her theft and cultivation choices. Internal conflict emerges in her hunger versus the Elders' disapproval, though the resolution feels somewhat easy—the Elders soften and the village accepts her transgression without visible cost to relationships or status. The final insight about trust arrives cleanly but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. Grandmother's voice and the journal provide texture, but the character arc from defiance to community acceptance smooths over potential friction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's motivations are clear and intensify through the discovery sequence, but her interior experience relies heavily on stock adventure-pilot gestures (breath hitched, grinned) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The mentor backstory seeds the quest but remains exposition; the final transformation ("wasn't just a pilot anymore") asserts change without embodying the contradictory cost of that shift. The moss spreading on her skin offers a concrete physical marker, yet the piece never dramatizes her struggle with or resistance to this alteration—she simply accepts and smiles, flattening what could have been genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra's internal contradiction is well-established—she once dismissed warnings, now chases anomalies—and her embodied stress (lungs burning, torn patch) grounds the pressure. The micro-choices (striking the flare, documenting then running) show hierarchy of values under threat. However, the backstory about the colleague's death and the flight engineer remains told rather than shown through on-page friction, and the final office scene's reflection ("Listen") edges toward declarative wisdom rather than earned embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation—to "certify wonder as essential"—is told rather than grounded in a lived contradiction. Her decision to "unfetter" lacks a visible internal cost or trade-off; she simply opposes the elders without dramatized hesitation or competing desire. Embodied emotion is thin: "misting breath," "closed eyes," and "smiled" are generic gestures that don't reveal character-particular sensation under pressure. The final choice feels unearned because no prior moment shows her risking something she values to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias carries interior contradiction (the guardianship as both duty and self-deception: "he had failed…but the lesson had been simpler than he'd wanted"), and the final choice to follow rather than guard feels earned by the question "What if you're wrong?" that unspooled his certainty. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("his fingers brushing the frost-bitten earth," "the flute warm against his skin"), but much of the middle leans on telling ("thirty years as a relic keeper…the slow unraveling of his own certainty"). The child's laughter functions as external pressure without full dramatization of Elias's internal conflict during the encounter; the turn feels philosophically declared rather than wrenched from contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—to understand "the mathematics of emotion"—remains abstract throughout. The borrowed personalities are described rather than embodied in distinct micro-choices; the widow's voice "clings" but doesn't visibly alter his syntax or decision-making on the page. The final turn ("You were never the printer. You were the page.") arrives as revelation rather than earned contradiction worked through prior impulses. The cost of letting go borrowed emotions is asserted in the ending rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    The courier's interior landscape is dominated by abstract metaphor ("the hum," "wonder," "the fade") rather than embodied emotion and contradiction. His decade-long quest and mentor's disappearance are told, not shown through micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values under pressure. The woman's sudden appearance and instant mastery lacks motivation, and the final transformation into pure metaphor ("his shadow stretching long behind him, then merging with the others") dissolves agency rather than crystallizing a choice with visible cost. Key moments—deciding to step onto the bridge, choosing to plant the final seed—read as predetermined ritual rather than character-driven decisions shaped by flaws or competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is characterized through contradictory impulses—he pursues proof yet fears inheritance—and the final choice to hurl the prism is earned by his realization about what his mother left inside. Embodied emotion is strong ("pulse hammering," "knees hit the damp earth") with minimal therapy-speak. Internal conflict operates simultaneously in the climactic beat where understanding and dread coexist. Minor deduction for the phrase "attentive mystic" which reads as a label rather than being shown through action across more beats.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The spinner's motivation is clear and embodied through weaving action, but her interior life remains static across decades—grief without contradictory impulses. The lover's response at the end introduces a second character whose renunciation mirrors hers, adding a symmetry that feels conceptually satisfying but lacks on-page friction or micro-choices under pressure. The sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; we see dedication but not the moment-to-moment cost of choosing to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The blacksmith's meekness and "slow-burning" determination are stated early but not shown through contradictory impulses in scene. His descent and silk-feeding read as resolute action without visible internal conflict or cost that would demonstrate genuine change versus endurance. The final image of steady hands suggests transformation, but the arc from trembling to steady is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Interiority remains abstract—"his heart the same"—rather than embodied and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("sensory map," "narratives," "threads of cause and effect") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to step through the seam feels inevitable given the setup but lacks visible cost—she grins and steps forward without forfeiting anything on the page. Internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized; her "pulse quickened" and she "didn't flinch" are stock reactions. The man's reappearance and hand-holding resolve tension without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's isolation and evolving relationship with the tower's prior keepers is embodied through concrete rituals (pocketing/returning the glass, stacking stones) that shift from private routine to active communion. The interiority is specific—"the ache of light that used to be"—and his final choice to stay forecloses the escape route his skiff represented, with visible cost (letting it rot). Micro-choices stack meaningfully: burning three letters, then engaging with the fourth, climbing the stairs, lighting the candle. Minor issue: the emotional arc from solitary grief to connection could show more internal contradiction; the progression reads smooth rather than knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority shows purposeful contradiction—her laughter as weapon, her prophetic speech unintended—but the character work suffers from ornamental gestures ("fingers that knew the weight of shadows") and generic embodiment ("her breath fogging the glass"). The central choice to deny the shadows dawn feels unmotivated by prior causality; we see ritual and stance but no earned internal conflict that makes this refusal cost her something visible. The backstory fragments (fishermen's reactions, two prior incantations) anchor her reputation but don't tilt a present micro-choice, remaining decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dye master's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete perception (the wing's iridescence, the ink moving), and the donor heart provides a bodily anchor for his search. The central motivation—understanding magnetism—remains abstract; the final realization ("the heart didn't magnetize stories. It recognized the cracks") arrives as assertion rather than through a specific on-page choice that demonstrates the insight. Embodied contradictions are limited; the character moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding without visible internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interior world is consistent and embodied through tactile work (mortar, trowel, sextant disassembly) with contradictory impulses present—he absorbs others' sorrow while maintaining his own emotional equilibrium. The moment he presses his palm to glass and feels "a sorrow, quantified" shows embodied emotion, and tears appearing "not from sadness, but from the sheer pressure of it" demonstrates nuanced internal complexity. The final choice to continue his work feels earned by his established role as conduit, though the cost remains oblique rather than sharp. Minor deduction: the astronomer's grief is felt but remains abstract; Elias's own stakes never tighten into a personal dilemma that forces him to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to restore the realm is clear and her agency drives the ending through her choice to sing. Her embodied interiority ("dug her nails into the soil until her fingers bled") shows commitment with physical cost. However, the arrival of villagers in the final third feels unearned—they appear without prior setup or dramatized motivation, functioning as convenient chorus rather than characters with their own agency. The transformation from dying to released lacks sufficient internal contradiction; Liora's arc moves too smoothly from isolation to communal restoration without visible psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is heavily reflective rather than embodied in the present. The guilt and empathy are asserted through exposition ("Her empathy was a curse") rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The climactic choice—locking the door—arrives without clear internal conflict dramatized on the page; we're told she "finally" answers but the path from guilt to release lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The thesis backstory functions as explanation rather than a live complication forcing on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's observational trait is established early ("always been the one who noticed"), but her interior life leans heavily on poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to plant crumbs and bake is motivated by character, yet the wheat's instant transformation removes sustained internal conflict—she shifts smoothly from question to action without friction. The prince's weeping at the end reads as received emotion rather than a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation ("extraction: to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") drives his task-oriented measuring throughout, but his internal contradiction emerges only late when the woman's face appears and he "trembles." The ending choice—stepping onto the bridge—arrives without visible friction between his orderly role and the personal longing that suddenly surfaces. The final paragraphs skip the cost of abandoning his ledger and his lifetime of measurement; the transition from records chief to vow-keeper feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's motivations are clear and consistently rooted in inherited debt and filial duty, with embodied emotion ("watch fob warm against her palm"). Her agency drives the climactic confrontation through calculated deception. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between hunting trust-breaking and becoming her father, though this could deepen further. The final renunciation—walking away with the sound "memorized"—earns credible closure, though the embodied cost at the peak moment leans slightly toward告 summary.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's arc from skeptic to convergence phenomenon has an internal logic, but the transformation feels primarily external rather than psychologically earned. The tin compass ring anchors some embodied moments ("burned against her skin"), yet the interior journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves from measurement to acceptance without friction or cost that feels personal. The piece gestures toward renunciation ("She didn't need it anymore") but the stakes remain atmospheric rather than grounded in a choice that forecloses something she visibly values.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's mnemonic gift is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost; the interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("the gift was a curse") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final painting sequence offers embodied emotion through physical action (knees hitting stone, arms burning), and the renunciation of charcoal for color reads as earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the mother's voice from the lock feels convenient rather than motivated by prior dramatization of the mnemonic trait.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's affliction (skin paling, joints stiffening near dishonesty) is vividly embodied and constrains his choices throughout. His decision to write ungilded truth at the end demonstrates earned change, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("his throat tightened" repeats as a go-to emotional cue). The final renunciation—not opening the new fragment—feels motivated by the Archive journey, but the visible cost could land more concretely on the page rather than being implied through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's seasonal muteness and devotion to her work are established early, but her interiority remains largely decorative rather than contradictory. The piece tells us she has "learned" and "spent years," but no micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses or hierarchy of values. The final act—gathering remnants and imagining the next sculpture—reads as ritual confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No meaningful internal friction or embodied struggle surfaces in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias-7's internal conflict is embodied through the "static in his chest cavity" and the box of fears, with clear contradictory impulses (preservation vs. destruction) that drive the climactic choice to burn the farm. The decision to step into the desert carries visible cost—abandoning his 127-year role—and his micro-choices (tucking the bloom behind his sensor, opening the box) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor weakness: the woman's backstory operates more as motivational furniture than live pressure, and some interiority edges toward poetic abstraction ("friction of two truths") rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to curate stories and facilitate healing is clear, but her decision-making shows limited internal conflict. The courtyard residents remain largely undifferentiated voices without distinct pressure on Mira's choices. The ending shift to "curator's work" feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost—Mira's stance doesn't meaningfully foreclose options or reveal what she has risked or renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interiority is vivid and her motivation is clear—she decodes the scientist's cipher through embodied action. However, her dance-as-solution feels under-dramatized; the piece asserts "her body the only machine capable of solving what logic alone could not" without showing why logic failed or what cost the dancing exacts. The scientist remains abstract, a collection of journals rather than a presence that tests her resolve. Internal contradiction is present (stealing vs. liberating) but not pressed hard enough to compel a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighter's grief-driven obsession is embodied through specific, ritual actions (coffee grounds, wildflowers, the stone), and his micro-choices under pressure feel motivated. Internal contradiction is present—his continued work lighting lanterns against his compulsion to excavate memory—though the chamber scene could show more moment-to-moment hesitation. The final renunciation (emptying his pockets) carries visible cost and forecloses the path, earning the change. Minor issue: the wife's vanishing is told rather than dramatized, weakening the emotional anchor slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The summoner remains abstract throughout—her choices (unfolding the wing, shaping silence, lunging) are presented as ritual gestures without embodied stakes or internal contradiction. Interiority relies on stock poetic phrasing ("hollow-eyed stare," "solitude pressing in") rather than character-particular thought. The failure moment ("She had failed") is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply rests, and the prophecy "sleeps" without on-page consequence that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to understand his whispering brownstone is concrete and drives his choices across the arc. The transformation from passive listener to active interrogator is earned through the seal-signing beat and the building's grief revelation. Veyra functions more as mechanism than character with distinct wants; his teacher role feels atmospheric rather than interpersonally charged. Minor: "patiently nimble" appears as a label without embodied cost in action.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's skepticism-to-belief arc is signaled early and earned through on-page choices (archiving memories, refusing to run), but her interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("tragically radiant," "the stubborn love that had kept her digging") that reads more poetic than embodied. The patrol confrontation shows agency, yet the cost of her choice is narrated rather than dramatized through bodily response or tactical friction. Her transformation from skeptic to "library" feels thematically announced rather than discovered through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The forger's interior life is largely told through abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His seventeen-year trajectory and final act of "forgiveness" are conceptually coherent but emotionally summarized; the trembling fingers and pooled ink offer some embodiment, yet pivotal moments—deciding to stay, guiding the Emperor's hand—lack the granular micro-choices and contradictory impulses that would make the renunciation visceral. The Emperor's sudden vulnerability reads more like plot necessity than earned interiority, and both characters speak in elevated, interchangeable diction that flattens voice distinction at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and her goal drives action, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The shell-pressing and descent show micro-choices, but the climactic confrontation with Kaelis feels more like revelation than earned psychological shift—she understands rather than wrestles with competing impulses. Kaelis functions primarily as exposition vessel; his transformation lacks prior causal grounding. The cost of hurling the shell reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a lived path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage is embodied through concrete actions—carving the shrine, handling the locket, interpreting the widow's grief. Her internal contradiction (claiming she "let go" while keeping fragments) operates on the page through simultaneous holding and releasing. The widow's arc from misidentified grief to redirected hope shows clear transformation with visible cost. Minor slip: the mother's accusation feels slightly under-earned given limited prior setup of that specific relationship tension.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is spare but consistent—his attention to pattern, deliberate gestures, and quiet teaching through demonstration feel rooted. Liora's gasped epiphany ("They *heard* me?") tips slightly toward unearned, though her initial skepticism and gradual engagement track well. The whistle-and-breath choices embody their values without heavy label-speak. The final handoff (Liora picks up the whisk, cycle begins again) suggests endurance but the cost of that choice remains implied rather than visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by a decade-long pattern of debunking conspiracies, but the turn toward acceptance of the "cure" lacks sufficient on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he shifts from skeptic to believer too smoothly. His final choice to "turn the key" feels unmotivated by prior internal conflict; the laugh ("of course the truth wasn't a conspiracy") asserts epiphany rather than earning it through dramatized struggle. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("religion of disbelief") and the climactic renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior life is vivid and embodied through concrete sensory details (fogging the glass, hands shaking), but his transformation lacks clear on-page contradiction that would reveal competing impulses in action. The shift from listener to speaker/prophet arrives suddenly without prior micro-choices dramatizing the internal conflict between allegiances. The final cost—becoming something other than himself—is gestured at through the reflection wearing "his face but not his doubt," but the choice itself feels declared rather than earned through struggle. Label-speak intrudes at key beats ("the hinge, little god") without sufficient embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through his concrete actions with the jars and music box. The girl's appearance and his decision to share rather than hoard demonstrates genuine internal shift. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice feels somewhat telegraphed by the thematic setup rather than emerging from dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The engineer's motivation is clear and her choice to turn the key despite lethal cost is earned by prior causality. Her embodied perception through vibrations and the molars-aching subsonic whine grounds the interior. The monks' "heretic" accusation and her counter-logic ("not about erasure...about matching") establish internal contradiction. However, the final transformation ("nerves rewriting themselves into something less human, more ethereal") edges toward abstraction without concrete micro-choices that anchor the shift, and "forgiven by physics" risks label-speak at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interiority is coherent and distinct—his patience is embodied through ear-to-stone listening and moon-path tracking. However, the sister's dismissal ("like a man waiting for permission to live") is told, not dramatized, and the final choice to walk onto the rising viaduct feels more declarative than earned by on-page contradiction or visible cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, listening, stepping onto ice) but they don't meaningfully foreclose options or reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than scene-driven tension that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's investigator role is grounded in concrete detail (stress fractures, drainage grate analysis), and his father's teaching provides clear motivation. Interior life shows embodied perception ("breath hitched," "hands shook") and contradiction (not believing in ghosts while following whispers). However, the final turn—running to the archives—feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that test his commitment to exposure versus safety. The character remains functional but the climactic agency lacks visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and his final choice to mail letters emerges from on-page contemplation of Harkin's gift. The contradiction between waiting for absolution and making it is embodied in his physical acts—winding the key, soldering, writing—though the epiphany about mercy being "built" skirts close to diagnostic clarity without full embodiment. The twelve-year-delayed letter provides visible cost, but the emotional arc from paralysis to action could show more friction; the shift reads smooth rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pip's steadily curious nature is embodied in concrete actions—prying the arrow free, testing new wing designs, leaping repeatedly despite crashes—but the motivation reads more as label than contradiction. The "yearning algorithm" concept and her dismissal of other gliders' warnings suggest internal conflict, yet no genuine competing impulse acts simultaneously in scene; she simply iterates. The final choice to leap again after the workshop collapses feels consistent but not earned by a visible trade-off with felt cost. The repeated crashes and modifications demonstrate endurance, but the piece never dramatizes a moment where curiosity conflicts with survival or doubt in a way that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation is clear and her brother's disappearance drives choices consistently. The interiority during the archive exploration shows concrete thought patterns ("They didn't just store data. It *consumed* it"). However, her decision to accept deletion at the end feels insufficiently motivated—the leap from discovery to willing erasure lacks the embodied hesitation or fear that would ground such a terminal choice. The final "smiled" and acceptance reads as convenient closure rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivations are established—his shadow-laced peacekeeper nature, his intuitive reading of conflict—but his interiority remains more atmospheric than contradictory. The decision to step onto the ice with the girl is signaled early and unfolds without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is present in gestures (exhaling, touching the fragment) but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization. The final choice feels predetermined by his nature rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interior life is textured with embodied sensation (parasol tip digging into palm, bones humming), and the ice-crossing beat demonstrates agency under pressure. The grandmother's initials reveal (*Endings Matter*) lands as convenient epiphany rather than earned realization—it's ungrounded in prior dramatized struggle and reads as authorial convenience. The cancellation decision lacks visible cost or trade-off on the page; we're told she postpones but don't see what she forfeits or confronts internally at that pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's interiority shows concrete embodiment—the letter "burned against his palm," wine tasting "of smoke and old regrets"—and his reflective stance deepens through micro-choices (carrying the letter, sketching shadows). The five-year backstory with Mira is anchored to present stimuli and tilts his understanding, though the final shift toward "holding the tension of two truths" reads slightly abstract rather than enacted through a live choice. The renunciation of alignment is earned but lacks a visible forfeiture that closes a specific option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysan's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile engagement with the parapet, her half-mask anchoring physical presence. Her motivation to preserve "quieter wisdoms" against the prophet's fervor drives choices with genuine cost—kneeling, consecrating through recalled silence, staying until borders hold. The voice in the pavilion functions more as thematic mirror than full character, but Lysan's micro-choices (pressing palm, adjusting mask, staying past exhaustion) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the prophet's followers remain abstract threat rather than immediate pressure, slightly diluting the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist is established through action (collecting photographs, framing them) and clear motivation (transmuting collective pain), but remains abstract. Her choices—kneeling, plucking lavender, arranging photos—feel illustrative rather than pressured by contradiction. The piece gestures toward internal conflict ("her chest didn't ache") but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously. Body and gesture remain generic (traced clasps, slight smiles) without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias shows clear motivation and contradiction—thirty years chasing language growth, now adrift when it stops—and his choice to collaborate at the end is earned by the crystal's revelation. Interiority is concrete ("breath shallow enough to leave the air undisturbed") and the woman's entrance forces a stakes-raising choice. Minor slip: the woman's motivation and backstory arrive unanchored, creating a slight convenience feel, but the final decision to leave carries visible cost (abandoning his solo obsession). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is vivid and embodied through ritual actions—kneeling, pressing chalk, arranging driftwood—but the "precognitively forgetful" trait remains largely ornamental, labeled rather than dramatized as a constraint that forces errors or choices. Internal contradiction appears in his carrying the tape he threw away, yet the final turn toward acceptance ("he didn't mind") feels abrupt rather than earned by prior causal struggle. The micro-choices (running toward the sculpture, pressing the tape to its chest) advance pressure but lack visible cost that forecloses a prior want.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied perception ("fingers tracing fractures," "pulse syncing with its relentless motion"), and his shift from mending to moving-with demonstrates earned change. However, the arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he moves smoothly from observer to participant without genuine internal friction. The final renunciation (leaving the hand spinning, walking away) reads as deliberate but arrives without visible cost: no dramatized loss or foreclosed relationship that would ground the transformation in sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation is clear and embodied through gestures (vinyl shard pressed to lips, staying until the nurse arrives) that reveal her contradictory impulses—kindness as both gift and "betrayal." Mrs. Calloway's arc from white-knuckled despair to clear-eyed goodbye is earned through the music's concrete effect (fingers tapping, shoulders unclenching). The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, though "decisively kind" reads slightly abstract. Interior contradiction operates in scene rather than summary, and the final renunciation (dropping the vinyl) forecloses attachment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—seeking answers about vanishing shadows—and her quiet deliberation manifests in tactile, methodical actions (adjusting lens, tracing metal, pressing palm). Internal contradiction appears when she smiles at the automaton's warning and chooses danger, showing want versus fear. The final choice to kick open doors rather than knock shows earned agency, but the shift from cautious scholar to bold transgressor lacks visible struggle or cost in the pivot moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's motives are clear and consistent—bone-setter habits drive her investigative approach, and her "forgiving skeptic" stance is embodied in micro-choices (picking up the tooth without screaming, pressing it to her palm). Internal contradiction is present but muted: she believes in lies more easily than truths, yet the story doesn't dramatize this tension under peak pressure. The bargain with the changeling feels sudden; the decision to "turn them into stars" lacks visible ambivalence or cost on the page, reducing the final choice's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is consistently texture-driven and embodied through her hands and sensory focus, avoiding label-speak. Her decision to teach the girl emerges from established pattern (keeper, polisher, patience), though the arrival feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure. The grandmother's backstory anchors present stance effectively. Elias functions as memory rather than on-page pressure, reducing interpersonal crucible work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is specific and embodied—"fingers tracing the pattern," "pressed the moss into his palm"—with micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The moss-handling and pendant-giving are deliberate acts under pressure. However, her motivation remains largely told ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Javier's arc is thin; his presence enables Lena's choices but he lacks genuine internal conflict or a visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and particular—the "voices...that whispered *not good enough, not true enough*" and his decade of "novels that bent reality into sharp, unyielding angles" give him clear stakes. His final choice to dissolve into the story carries weight, though the transition feels somewhat abrupt: the faceless figure's confrontation ("you never let us breathe") does the heavy thematic lifting rather than Elias's own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The embodied seashell-pressing and spiral-tracing anchor his physical presence, but the peak choice reads more as submission to external pressure than an earned internal reckoning with competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior state is legible through embodied action (trembling fingers, kneeling to feel the pulse), and her conflict between safe storytelling and risky truth-singing drives the core choice. The shift from tinkerer to song-keeper is earned by on-page action with visible cost (throat burning, chest tight). However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("the weight of what she'd almost let die") and the emotional progression feels somewhat tidy—fear to action to resolution—without sufficient complication or contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interior is coherent and voice-particular, with embodied patience shown through spinal curve and wrist steadiness. However, the character operates in near-total isolation without meaningful internal contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation or stance crystallization reads more as thematic assertion than a choice foreclosing a live path with felt interpersonal or tactical cost. Interiority remains abstract in places ("translate them into maps," "teaching it how to stay") rather than grounded in concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's motivation is clear—storing wonder for his daughter—and his reflective nature shapes micro-choices (aligning gears, sketching diagrams). Internal contradiction appears when he claims he's "not here to fix it—not exactly," yet proceeds methodically toward a functional mechanism; this ambivalence feels authentic. However, the daughter's agency is minimal (one eye-roll), and the wife exists only as an echo, so the emotional stakes rest on telling rather than on-page friction. The final choice to "leave it running" carries visible cost (exposure of the secret, thinning of echoes), but the transformation feels more asserted than earned through escalating pressure.

    Elira's motivation to collect burdens is signaled early, but her internal contradiction—coming to release yet becoming trapped—lacks embodied micro-choices that show her wrestling with the cost in real time. The realization "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" arrives as epiphany rather than earned through prior dramatized friction. The final vanishing reads as conceptual surrender, but the path from resistance to acceptance is told via metaphor rather than shown through on-page decisions with visible stakes. The child's fear lingering and the grotto's counter-pressure offer moments of tension, but Elira's agency in those beats remains largely passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The widow's interiority is concrete and embodied—"her hands learning the language of absence," the carving as containment rather than resurrection. Internal contradiction operates through the tension between practical daily rhythm and profound loss, shown in micro-choices like keeping the final lion rather than selling it. The renunciation at closure (letting the lions go "one cut at a time") is earned by the accumulating particulars of her craft and grief. Minor slip: the "half-gone herself" line edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied work surrounding it maintains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's interior world is concrete and particular—"time had frayed like the hem of her coat," the weight of collected stories "coiled in her ribs." The ghost confrontation dramatizes internal conflict through externalized iterations of self, though the twenty-five-year-old's interiority bleeds slightly into Lira's narration. The final choice to surrender to the lagoon is earned by the accumulation of collected failures and the physical leap embodies renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the ghost's voice occasionally converges with Lira's perceptual signature in diction and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's functional creativity is consistently embodied through on-page problem-solving (jury-rigging the bridge, mapping water flows, repurposing the terminal). Her interior voice shows contradictory impulses—the pull toward规则 versus the itch to solve—but the final choice feels slightly mechanical, announced rather than wrested from competing desires. The sextant discovery and hydroponics resurrection demonstrate competence, yet genuine struggle is muted; she calculates rather than fumbles, which flattens the cost. Micro-choices are present but the resolution lacks visible friction or a path foreclosed with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scribe's interiority is concrete and particular—"quill suspended above the parchment like a bird too afraid to land"—and the arc from paralysis to action is earned through the petrichor trigger and the decision to fracture the forecourt. Embodied emotion is strong: "his joints protesting," the palm pressed to wet crystal. The final choice to arrange the orrery "imperfect, asymmetrical, alive" forecloses the elder-approved path with visible cost, meeting the Earned Stasis test. Minor: the elders' disapproval is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the antagonistic pressure, but the scribe's internal contradiction (fear vs. desire) drives the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's characterization operates through concrete objects (sundial, ledger) and selective perception (canal's reflection, heron's flight). The decision to drop the ledger and keep the sundial shows internal contradiction with visible cost—releasing the mapped destinations but retaining the tool that "points inward." However, the line "the architecture of lies—the way they were framed, the way they sagged under their own weight" reads as diagnostic meta-commentary that tells rather than embodies her expertise. The final choice to steer toward docks after dropping the ledger feels earned but the intermediate beats often substitute poetic observation for micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is motivated by patient collection of stories embedded in objects, and his trait of infinite patience is shown through decades of seed-collecting. His action at closure—splicing the seed pod into the rope and whispering the fisherman's name—feels somewhat arbitrary rather than internally conflicted; the protagonist moves through reverent discovery without meaningful resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("fingerprints of those who'd shaped them before memory") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interior is present but largely static: he observes, interprets, and concludes without genuine internal conflict or cost. The prince's brother exists only as an absence—no relationship friction or stakes test occurs on the page. The final decision to "board the next ship" arrives without prior contradiction or choice architecture that would make it feel earned rather than declared. Embodiment is thin; "the thread grew warm in his palm, pulsing like a heartbeat" and similar moments feel asserted rather than grounded in sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric's motivation is dramatized through embodied action—trembling fingers, pressed ear to the egg—and the prince's drive is rooted in memory of his mother and opposition to mechanical stagnation. Internal conflict appears in the "quaking certainty that he was tampering with a genesis already doomed to fail," and the final moment shows contradictory impulses: laughter or weeping as indistinguishable responses. The piece sustains interiority through concrete particulars (warmed oil, spun glass needle) rather than therapy-speak, though the choice at closure is more acceptance than a path-foreclosing decision with harder cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's core contradiction (arsonist's daughter turned firefighter) is established, but her interior life remains largely abstract. The boy-rescue demonstrates competence without meaningful internal conflict—she moves through the sequence with professional smoothness rather than dramatized ambivalence. The village's judgment is told rather than felt through micro-choices under pressure. The final "she had long since learned to tell them apart" asserts resolution without showing the cost of that knowledge in a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's skepticism and defiance anchor her choices (refusing to believe in patience, then pushing the door). Internal texture is present ("sharp-edged" memories, the "luminous skeptic" framing) but some moments lean toward metaphoric assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The younger-voice confrontation ("They're not yours to take") offers internal friction but arrives late and resolves quickly without sustained cost on the page. Micro-choices (following breadcrumbs, pressing the box, pulling threads) are visible but the final departure lacks a foregrounded trade-off that charges the ending image with felt interpersonal or knowledge cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Veyra's interiority is abstract and ornamental rather than embodied—"troubling serenity," "sigh," "breath hitched" are stock gestures without character-particular contradiction. The choice to sacrifice memory feels thematically motivated but lacks on-page micro-hesitation or competing impulse in the moment; she simply "closes her eyes" and proceeds. The ancestor's voice offers wisdom without dramatized friction against Veyra's present need. Internal conflict is asserted ("wound and a blessing both") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carver's motivation is clearly established and his internal conflict between grief and craft drives choices. The spectral father's intervention is embodied through physical guidance of hands, though the carver's acceptance lacks visible hesitation or cost. The daughter's trembling at the table suggests emerging characterization, but her presence feels designed to receive the lesson rather than complicate it. The final smile and teaching resolve too smoothly without wrestling through contradictory impulses in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias carries a distinct interior contradiction—winding the clock with ethical diligence yet carving a ledger of communal silence into his father's rake. His motivation (atoning for the family's failure to speak) drives micro-choices under pressure: slowing the chime, pressing the rake to the bob, accepting future council outrage. The final smile and reach for the knife demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost (council wrath, perpetual outsider status). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the closing paragraph's "slow, deliberate act" edges toward thematic articulation rather than pure embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias possesses a coherent interior life—his "blithe nature not dimmed but *deepened*"—and his decision to untangle the knots flows from established traits (speaking to worms and dead things with kindness). The emotional embodiment is strong ("throat tightened," hands that don't shake), and the final choice to tell the widow what he saw carries visible cost in that he transforms ignorance into knowledge with stakes. However, the widow's motivation and arc remain mostly off-page, and the chess frame feels ornamental rather than a crucible that forces micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation is signaled early ("seeding what could grow"), but her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphors rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The dot-to-map sequence shows a micro-choice, but the stakes remain conceptual; no internal conflict forces competing impulses in scene. The final beat offers renunciation ("stepping back to watch what grew"), yet the cost is stated rather than dramatically felt—no visible foreclosure of a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to restore narrative through pirate broadcast is clear and consistent, and his choice to open the door and continue the broadcast with Lira emerges from prior pressure. Interiority remains specific ("dust on her sleeves shimmer, just for a second") and grounded in the copyist's trade. However, the final sequence—Ministry finding the empty alcove and phrase appearing citywide—shifts to summary after the core choice, and the vanishing feels convenient rather than earned by prior on-page constraint. The girl Lira arrives late and her agency is minimal; she functions primarily as validation rather than applying pressure that forces Elias to alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interior world is vivid and grounded in concrete actions—burning the portrait, scattering ashes with precision, wearing the mask made from her mother's teacup. The sister's accusation and Liora's response ("I reveal what they already were") provide glimpse of internal contradiction, though more micro-choices under pressure would deepen agency. Embodied emotion is strong (the mask's edges biting, the weight shifting), but the peak choice—burning because she "understood him too well"—feels more asserted than dramatized with visible cost in that moment. The renunciation is present but could be more causally earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is rendered through contradictory impulses—hoarding relics while knowing survival demands selling them, intellectualizing his pain while physically agonizing over objects. His final choice to stand in the tunnel's mouth with the cog is earned by prior causality: his mother's death, the council's indifference, his week of hauling evidence into the vault. The embodied detail is strong ("fingers twitched," "hands bled," "voice rough as rust"), though Veyra remains a functional messenger without interior pressure. Elias's renunciation forecloses survival with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("expectantly resigned sigh of a student who had forgotten their music"), and his micro-choices—humming the shape of a tune, placing the rosette where all can see—reveal hierarchy of values. The four remaining choir members are sketched with embodied detail (tremor, bullet-scarred folder) that serves pressure rather than ornamentation. Internal conflict is present but largely contemplative; the final choice to hum and invite joining is motivated, though the cost remains implicit rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his gift for tasting memories creates a distinctive perceptual signature. However, his arc relies heavily on reflection and summary—the shift from bitter chef to "gardener of moments" is told through exposition rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to share the fruit is presented as fait accompli rather than earned through visible struggle. Internal conflict remains abstract: "pruning away the rot" is metaphorical summary, not embodied decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's affliction of truth and his handling of the seed demonstrate consistent internal logic, and his physical embodiment (rough hands, scuffed boots) grounds him. The final exchange with the child shows earned vulnerability after years of burden. However, the motivation for planting the seed relies heavily on exposition about what his father told him rather than present-scene pressure, and the engineers' predictable disbelief feels asserted rather than dramatized. The trait "born with the affliction of truth" constrains one moment ("The truth rose in him, but this time, it didn't burn") but otherwise functions as backstory decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's interiority is concrete and her quest to understand why houses feel alive drives her choices. The orris shard placement and spiral arrangement show micro-choices under pressure. However, the character remains somewhat static—her "understanding" at the end feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization ("houses that had learned to listen") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would elevate this to high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's telepathic choices drive the human's transformation through three revelations, each narrowing options with visible cost. The human's shift from poisoner to participant is earned through contradictory impulses (desperation vs. doubt) visible in trembling fingers and fogged helmet. However, interiority leans toward label-speak at key beats ("structural weakness of their certainty," "incisively kind") rather than embodied perception. The final choice—pressing the seam, removing the helmet—forecloses the mission with death as cost, but the human remains more vessel than agent with distinct flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena's interiority is concrete and character-particular (mathematician's lens on recursion, proof-speak in crisis). Internal conflict operates live when she reaches the door: the trembling fingers and "could step through" beat show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—pressing the door, turning back—is earned by prior causality (the chipped die as deliberate flaw, her proof about closed systems), and the cost is visible: she leaves the smooth die behind and accepts perpetual motion as choice rather than trap. Minor deduction: "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" read as labels without sufficient embodied pressure testing those traits in micro-choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    The painter's internal contradiction between insomnia and hope is embodied through concrete actions—painting on dying leaves, responding to the brush's memory. The calligrapher functions more as symbolic catalyst than pressure-applying character. The protagonist's choices (what to paint, when to rest) feel motivated but the stakes remain abstract; the final surrender to sleep reads earned but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Minor deduction for the "methodically hopeful" construction appearing as tell rather than fully dramatized choice-under-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's choice to shatter the lens and begin carving her own initials feels earned by the lens's revelations, though her interior remains somewhat abstract during peak pressure. The displaced chorus functions more as atmospheric history than active relational crucible. Her transformation from guide to active rescuer is legible, but the beekeeper's absorption and her sudden understanding lean toward convenient epiphany rather than micro-choices under contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's obsession is vividly embodied through oil-stained fingers and years of reverse-engineering, but his final choice—stepping onto the stone—arrives without visible internal contradiction or hesitation that would reveal competing impulses. The interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("madness was staying shore-bound") rather than concrete, embodied struggle. The cost is conceptual (leaving the world) but not dramatized as a micro-choice with visible tradeoff on the page. Villagers are invoked but never pressure him directly, weakening relational crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lysander's motivation is clear (confront the cursed doppelgänger), but interiority relies heavily on stock Gothic phrasing ("the rust of old secrets," "resuscitation's cruel spark") rather than character-particular thought. The final choice—lunging through the thing to pull out the filmstrip—reads as physically embodied, yet the stakes remain abstract; we never see what living with the curse actually costs him in daily terms. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("I'm not here to fight" as a lie) but not deeply inhabited. The whispering advisor appears only in reported speech, diluting her pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leeward's motivation ("to dub obstacles into rhythm") is present but operates more as thematic statement than dramatized choice. His internal experience is filtered through heavily metaphoric perception rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "restless energy" and final thrill are asserted more than shown through micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he remains in the same exploratory stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elyas's motivation to decode the watchers is established and his interiority shows purposeful focus ("quietly driven, not by fear, but by the gnawing certainty"), but the protagonist remains largely observational until the final sequence. His micro-choices—kneeling, blowing the whistle, pressing his forehead—read as ritualized rather than conflicted. The final walk forward carries cost (whistle crumbles, city trembles), but the embodied emotion and internal contradiction needed to elevate the choice are abstracted by lyric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is competent and clear in motive—rescuing truth—but the characterization relies heavily on telling ("emotionally rational as ever, though his pulse betrayed him") rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. His interactions with Callahan feel stagey; the priest arrives as a foil rather than applying genuine pressure through their relationship. The final choice to slip into shadows reads more as escape than costly renunciation, leaving the change underearned. Minor positives: his micro-choices (photographing the page, laying out documents) do advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through consistent occupation-specific detail (surveyor's tools, trowel work, mortar repair) and a clear internal drive to preserve stories. His motivations are embodied in concrete actions—pocketing the inkwell, writing replies, sealing notes—but the interior contradiction remains thin: his wife left "for the sharp clarity of a life without ghosts," yet we see no on-page micro-choice where that loss pressures a present decision. The final dream and library exchange feel like gentle confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to trace "honest origins" and "lies woven into margins" is established and drives his choice to pursue the stamp's coordinates. His tranquil perception is embodied through deliberate movements and "steady pulse," though it occasionally trends toward label ("tranquilly perceptive"). The discovery scene shows internal contradiction—his claim that curiosity isn't his motivation rings false given his immediate pursuit—but the final choice to leave the chamber and return to work carries visible cost in foreclosed knowledge. Minor deduction: the character's professional competence faces no genuine blind spot or mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lantern maker's motivation (folding grief into the basilica's dream recording) is clear and embodied through concrete actions—polishing the gem, pressing it into the glass. Her interior state is shown through physical sensation ("the way it *pulled* at her skin, hungry") and memory fragments, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to "let go" and merge with the recording feels earned by her years of preparation, though the path from assembling the basilica to becoming part of it could show more micro-hesitation to deepen the contradictory impulses. Her shadow's detachment is evocative but remains abstract; a brief on-page consequence of that severing (a stumble, a missed perception) would ground the cost more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation—hunting unused potential—is clear and embodied through the geode handling and console interaction. Internal contradiction exists (survivor vs. perturbation) but her micro-choices feel more concept-driven than psychologically grounded; the shift from grief to "bleak exhilaration" arrives without visible intermediate cost. The final stance ("She was the perturbation") reads as a label rather than an earned interior reckoning. Embodied detail is present (burnt sugar smell, pulse hammering) but the wedding-to-hunter arc compresses three weeks into declarative summary rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interior is specific and embodied—"perpetually surprised by how little others saw," "chest tightened," the drone as extension of agency—and her final turn (taking the pilgrim's hand) is earned by the shared constellation reveal. The pilgrim remains functional but thin; his "hunger" is told more than shown, and his lunge feels pro forma. Internal contradiction is present (Lena's need to decode belonging versus her solitary methods) but not stressed enough to elevate the choice at closure into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is concrete—guilt over Harkin's disappearance—and his interior contradiction (skilled at manufacturing lies yet unable to reconstruct Harkin's truth) drives the arc. The choice to hurl the watch hand and then retrieve the note crystallizes his shift from passive penance to active agency with visible cost: attending tomorrow's appointment closes the path of evasion. The embodiment is strong ("breath came shallow," "fingers tracing grooves"), though the climactic moment leans slightly toward atmospheric reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is motivated by a consistent ethic—untethering stalemates, recycling mistakes into wisdom—and his micro-choices (offering the drawer pull, the cache location) track that hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction (thinking of prisoners as "seeds" while trading them like chess pieces) adds texture. Kaelis's hesitation and her nephew's raw wrists give embodied emotion, and the boy's final question ("Will they forgive me?") lands with credible vulnerability. Minor slip: Elias's interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("the weight of neutral territory pressed too hard"), but the closure choice—giving the boy time to try—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority shows embodied regret through the compass weight and pole-counting, and the final choice to turn inland is motivated by prior causality. However, the daughter's letter provides convenient epiphany-level insight ("You were lost the moment you chose the chart over me") that edges toward therapy-speak, and the bar scene's "Just late" feels like a thematic statement rather than earned contradiction. The progression from flight to staying is visible but the internal conflict often alternates in summary rather than acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liam's motivation is clear—neural scrubbing survivor seeking redemption—but interior contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatized. The final chess scene attempts earned change, but the journey from clinic to confrontation relies heavily on atmospheric wandering rather than concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("throat tightened") but often gives way to abstract introspection. The choice to sit and play chess feels more symbolic gesture than hard-won decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, with embodied grief ("crushed saffron," "fingers twitched") driving her conjuring attempts. Internal contradiction operates through action: she calls her brother's beliefs nonsense yet enacts them. The final acceptance ("she didn't fight it") feels slightly underdeveloped—the shift from resistance to bridge-state needed one more on-page micro-choice to fully earn the cost. Secondary characters (stag, brother-phantom) apply immediate pressure but remain abstract conduits rather than distinct presences.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to find her brother is clear and drives the journey, but the crucial moment of "letting go" arrives through dialogue exposition ("You have to repent") rather than earned through her own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The embodied details (trembling fingers, throat tightening) anchor emotion well in early beats, but the climactic renunciation lacks visible cost—she simply "unfastens" and the grief releases without the struggle that would make the choice credible. The brother's appearance as adult-but-unchanged reads more symbolic than causally motivated within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lien's interiority remains consistent—her three-hundred-year persistence and acceptance of failure read as earned. The "shadow work" and stitching manifest as physical micro-choices (picking up the needle, exhaling slowly). However, the interior remains largely contemplative; contradictory impulses do not act simultaneously in high-pressure beats, and the final step-through feels more conceptual than a choice with visible personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elira's destitution and philanthropic impulse are established early, and her final choice to hurl the vials into lava feels character-rooted. However, interiority remains thin—her reactions are often told through metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The move from observation ("understand the texture of transformation") to action (throwing bottles) lacks visible internal friction; she orchestrates coincidences but we see no micro-choices where competing impulses collide. The laugh at the prophecy reads as a gesture rather than a moment of genuine complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clearly rooted in the ledgers—a concrete, character-particular driver that avoids abstraction. His tactical choices (timing the blackout, using his lock knowledge) show competence balanced by genuine risk, and the final whistle suggests genuine emotional progression. However, interiority leans toward summary ("his heart hardening like steel") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the twelve-year backstory arrives as exposition rather than through micro-choices that tilt present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's curse of knowing "the moment before something shifted" is established but remains more atmospheric than action-driving until late. Her micro-choices—placing rocks, reaching for dust, pressing palms to sand—accumulate pressure, though internal contradiction is limited; she moves through the sequence with ritual certainty rather than competing impulses. The final stance ("just the one cursed to keep it") registers as acceptance with cost, but the protagonist's agency reads more as conduit than author of change. Embodied emotion is present ("fingers bleeding where the grains bit too deep") yet the therapeutic frame ("cursed to keep it") edges toward label-speak at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias as censored poet is established through ink-stained fingers and silenced verses, but his internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—he cycles between remembering and releasing without genuine friction. The wrist-scars moment ("roads or warnings") gestures at complexity but remains decorative rather than forcing a choice with visible cost. The tearing of the poem reads as symbolic release rather than motivated by prior causality; the shift from preservation to storm-editing lacks embodied struggle. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy the pain") without grounding in concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (turning questions into destinations) drives his sundial investigation with embodied detail—mechanical arm whirring, pulse quickening. His final choice to pocket the key and partner with Liora feels earned by the atrium duel. However, interiority remains thin: we see gestures and reactions but little internal contradiction or struggle between competing impulses. The twelve-year revelation lands as plot information rather than a moment that reweights his hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior contradictions operate simultaneously—the itch to leave versus the pull to stay—and the final gesture (giving Maren the violet) is an embodied micro-choice that forecloses flight with felt cost. However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward poetic abstraction ("stitched meaning into chaos") rather than character-particular thought, and the name-molting trait remains largely told rather than dramatized in pressure. Maren functions well as a pressure point, but her interior remains opaque; we see her actions, not her stakes. The closure choice is earned, but the path there leans on lyricism more than micro-decisions under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lena's internal state is consistently rendered through embodied action—winding a stopped clock, reading compasses, splicing film—and her longing is steely rather than maudlin. The reunion scene shows restraint ("You're late" / "So are you") with subtext carried in gesture and the clock's chime rather than exposition. Minor slip: the lover's "lifetimes learning how to apologize" edges toward告 sentiment without full dramatization of his prior absence as choice or renunciation. The final cost—sitting at a new piano, suspended above endings—reads as Earned Stasis with visible opportunity cost (the old arbor, the old waiting) rather than unearned wish fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to protect the island's memory is clear and drives her to bite the seed despite the cost. The moment when she realizes "the dreams weren't echoes" shifts her understanding, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract. Her internal contradiction between fear and duty works, and the violet-stained teeth provide embodied detail. The villagers' reaction at dawn and her final stance offer closure, but the interiority leans heavily on elevated philosophical register rather than immediate sensory experience under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's interior is richly embodied through his handling of the bonsai and compass, with micro-choices (pressing palm to sand, humming his mother's tune) that reveal values under pressure. The brother backstory anchors present grief without overwhelming the scene, and the final act of planting the compass demonstrates earned transformation. Internal contradiction is present—stubborn guilt versus the impulse to release—but the resolution feels slightly too smooth, lacking a visible cost that forecloses another path. The transition from regret to lightness needed one more moment of renunciation or friction to fully earn the change.

    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his scientific background, with embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure. His shift from control to witnessing is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak or stock phrasing; contradictions act in scene, such as his patience conflicting with prior urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her adaptive nature, intensifying with the brother revelation. Interiority is concrete, but contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous in scene. The final renunciation is earned with visible cost when she lets the ledger fall.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotions (trembling fingers, bleeding hands) and micro-choices (tracing heat-map, playing piano) earn her final decision to play the storm. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with no stock phrasing. The resolution forecloses a path with visible cost, scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's weary dedication is embodied through concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as feeling the lens's vibration and deciding to climb the lighthouse.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured—his astrophysics lens and attitude toward decay feel particular and coherent. His choices (keeping the dust, returning daily, finally taking a sabbatical) align with an emerging motive to witness rather than control. The emotional arc is quieter than it could be, with little on-page friction between his old ambition and new stance. The shift lands, but with more serenity than struggle, which slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and particular—her relationship to glass, frost, and the ledger feels lived and specific—and her realization about her brother lands with embodied cost (“settled like ash in her lungs”). The core shift from a maker of objects to someone who “follows the lines already drawn” is convincingly motivated by the fire and the ledger. Internal conflict between seeking her brother and releasing that quest is present but remains more thematic than sharply dramatized. The choice to drop the ledger is earned, though the emotional messiness of relinquishing the brother-thread could be thickened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s grief, resolve, and almost mystical sensitivity to sound are specific and embodied (“listened—not with her ears, but with the scars on her hands, the salt in her veins”). Motivation is clear and consistent: to “rectify what the storm had erased” and reclaim the *Capriccio* through sound. Her micro-choices—testing the piano, reinterpreting the case as cipher, deciding to sail back into the storm—arise credibly from that drive. Internal contradiction (terror vs compulsion, mourning vs creative awe) is present but could be made slightly more jagged in the peak beats to hit the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply sketched—“hands, cracked from salt and sorrow,” the last undertaker in a drowned city—with clear, consistent motives rooted in giving the dead rest. His key choices (keeping the lens, making the swim, using it, writing his own name) all align with that core drive. Internal contradiction is present but understated: his disbelief in “signs” versus his commitment to rest, and his stubborn endurance versus latent desire for his own place in the ledger. The emotional beats land, but the story stops just short of dramatizing a sharper, on-page clash between competing impulses in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives and values are clear and consistent, from the anonymous food runs to the public ringing, and his reluctant leadership reads convincingly. The relationship with Liora nicely externalizes the intergenerational stakes without over-explaining. Interiority is mostly implied rather than deeply embodied, especially at the peak confrontation, which slightly flattens emotional contradiction. Still, his choices feel earned and align tightly with the portrayed character.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—his lifelong pursuit to locate “where the unused love goes” and repair a specific past-life failure. Interiority is vivid and sensorily grounded, and the physician/patient memory reweights his present choices. However, his internal conflict is relatively smooth; once the shard appears, there’s little resistance or contradiction in him, so the final acceptance carries limited felt cost. This is rich, specific characterization, but not quite as ruthlessly pressured as the standard you’re aiming for.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives (unbuilding the maze, grappling with the “texture” of time) are clear and consistent, and her choices—using then rejecting the halo—feel grounded in who she is. Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory associations (ozone and lavender, the feel of thorns, the grain of wood). There is some implied but not deeply dramatized ambivalence about her attachment to the past versus the need to survive it, which keeps this shy of the very top band. Her final stance—designing edges instead of centers—reads as an earned evolution rather than a bolt-on epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena’s motives (liberate seeds/land via patience and cunning) are clear, consistent, and embodied in concrete micro-choices (decoding over months, triggering the trap rather than shooting/fleeing, scattering seeds rather than hoarding). Her backstory as a “chained liberator” and six years in a cell deepen her present-tense stakes without bogging momentum. Internal contradiction is relatively light—she hesitates only briefly at the vault—so she reads as a bit idealized, but not flat. The endurance-cost of her path is legible and gives her final walk away real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives (understanding absences, finding how trust sounds when it fails) are clear, particular, and consistently tied to his actions in the scene. His vocation, family history, and ritual of imprinting all cohere into a convincing interior logic. The final renunciation—letting the forge and greenhouse go under while carrying only the copper—feels earned and costly. Internal contradiction is present but mostly implicit; a slightly sharper rendering of his resistance to letting go could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is sharply drawn as an obsessive collector of “illuminated moments,” and her observational, pattern-reading mind is convincingly dramatized in the flower-code sequence. Her motivation to push against fate is clear and consistent through to the ending. Internal contradiction (fear vs. compulsion, cost vs. desire) is present but lightly sketched; her final “non-rising” doesn’t land with full emotional complexity because her feelings about that price aren’t deeply embodied on the page. The stationmaster functions more as a mouthpiece for the rules of fate than as a fully pressured relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in her craft; the glassblower sensibility filters everything from the thaw to the control room, and her final choice to activate the controlled collapse grows convincingly from guilt, loyalty, and a need to reframe her father’s legacy. The tension between abandonment and return, sanctuary and collapse, is embodied rather than declared. The main limitation is that her internal conflict never quite spikes into a truly agonizing moment of indecision on the page; she moves from recognition to action with a touch too much smoothness for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and particular—the stunt details, the water phobia, and the sense of erasure give her texture and credible motive for breaking into the library. The contradiction between her professional fearlessness and private terror is clear, though in this scene the water phobia functions more as theme than an active constraint. Her choice to bleed onto the shell and claim the ledger feels motivated by accumulated grievance rather than tidy epiphany. The girl is thinner but serves as an effective pressure point and mirror without derailing Lena’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eldrin’s motivation—mapping the night through collected silences—is clear, consistent, and embodied in how he handles the booklet and listens to the fort. However, his internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses or a real struggle between staying embodied and dissolving into the map. The final “choice” to let the booklet slip and become another coordinate feels fitting but almost serenely inevitable, with little felt resistance. This keeps the characterization rich but somewhat low-pressure for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    X-7’s curiosity and composure are clear and consistent, and its choices around the violin feel motivated by the “where do thoughts come from?” directive. The gradual shift from janitor-identity to multi-life consciousness is credible, though internal contradiction (fear vs. drive, resistance vs. seeking) is more implied than dramatized. Emotional states are largely filtered through conceptual language rather than embodied sensation, which slightly distances us. The final reclamation of a prior name/identity is earned but a touch swift for the profundity implied.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interiority is specific and textured—her history with tickets, mistrust, and the salvaged lens all feed her present-tense micro-choices. Her contradiction (distrust of words vs. desire to help others speak without them) is dramatized rather than labeled, especially in the moment she intervenes via the drawing instead of speech. The couple are sketched economically but with enough embodied behavior and subtext (“a concert ticket, passed back and forth like an accusation”) to feel human. The closing shift—her doodles becoming “clear” and her recommitment to this practice—feels earned, though the ease of her self-acceptance borders on a touch too smooth for truly top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vine dresser is specific and compelling: her ritual with the marbles, her choice to accept blame, and her quiet defiance in showing rather than arguing all feel earned and character-driven. Her love for the garden is embodied in setting details (roses where she wept, ivy spelling her name) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is lightly handled—she’s mostly serene, with little dramatized ambivalence under pressure—so the emotional arc feels more graceful than fraught. The elders function more as a collective force than distinct individuals, but they do shift credibly by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly motivated—he’s here to test his theory about time despite protocol and AI warnings—and his mechanic identity feels lived-in. His micro-choices (ignoring the anomaly flag, pulling and then fine-tuning the lever, finally resting his hand on it) track well with that drive. However, his inner conflict about violating rules, risking K‑11, or endangering the station is implied more than dramatized, so the felt cost to him as a person remains somewhat muted. The AI functions as a light foil rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s sensibility is vivid—his attraction to damage, silence, and coded images feels specific and consistent, and his choice to follow the ghost’s instructions grows naturally from that. The emotional arc from passive player to active interlocutor is clear, if quiet. Internal contradiction (fear vs desire, skepticism vs belief) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. The final renunciation—leaving without looking back—lands but could carry more felt cost if his prior attachment to the opera house were sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is rich, specific, and contradictory: she is called “unshakable” while secretly trembling at instruments and signs, and the tension between warning others and preserving her own margin of ambiguity feels lived-in. The fever, the charcoal-smudged illustration, and her hypersensitivity to small omens all build a coherent psychology. Her final choice to walk into the storm rather than speak into the radio is clearly motivated by her aversion to the burden of certainty and reads as an earned, costly renunciation. The only slight limitation is that the decision skews symbolic rather than fully dramatized against concrete relational stakes with other characters on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—testing his father’s confession and his own skepticism—is clean, specific, and tracks tightly to his choices, especially in turning the valve and then choosing not to run. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“his pulse jumped—too heavy for its size”) and avoids generic emotional labeling. There is some genuine contradiction between his scavenger pragmatism and his unwilling attraction to the uncanny, though that tension could be made one notch sharper on the page. The final stance—accepting a burden rather than proof—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s desire to dissolve into witnessing and silence is clear and consistent, and their rituals (returning to the refuge, folding the swan, refusing to read) reveal character through choice. However, internal contradiction is muted—there’s little on-page friction between their residual personhood and their chosen erasure. The significant “change” is more a continued endurance of a state than a pressured pivot, which slightly blunts impact. Still, the transformation into “another fold in the quiet” feels earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn—his “mellow” patience, work as a music therapist, and childhood memory of the ridge all cohere into clear, consistent motivation. Lila and Mira register as individuals through specific details (the metronome-like shirt twisting, the vial) despite limited space. The shift in Elias’s self-understanding at the end (“his job wasn’t to fix broken things—but to remind them…”) is earned by prior behavior. What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger sense of contradiction or cost in his interiority; he rarely feels genuinely torn or under emotional strain.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sharply etched as the last, patient historian whose whole being orients around listening to what remains; his care with objects (“like a man handling a wound”) and his physical responses give him specificity. Motivation is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction is muted—he yields to the pull almost immediately, with little on-page struggle. The choice to leave the silo carries implied cost yet isn’t deeply dramatized as a wrenching conflict. Overall, a strong, coherent characterization that stops short of complex ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s characterization is specific and textured—his belief in “open secrets,” the inherited ink, and the orchestrator-not-spy stance all feel idiosyncratic and coherent, and his choice to leave the lighthouse tracks cleanly with what we know. However, his internal conflict (duty vs. self-preservation vs. appetite for orchestration) is implied more than dramatized, so the cost of leaving remains a little abstract. The fisherman’s daughter and the cook function well as pressure and echo rather than as deep foils, which is appropriate for this length but keeps the relational crucible fairly light.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The priest’s motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions rather than banish—is clear and governs his choices, especially stepping into the indigo knowing the risk. His internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see much simultaneous fear/curiosity, just a steady commitment to inquiry. The relationship with the possessing entity has interesting status play but is underused as a true crucible. The novice is sketched effectively but lightly, mostly as inheritor rather than a fully individuated character.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Li Wei’s interiority is specific and textured—his ache is tied to concrete details like his mother’s sewing machine and the drowned village, not abstract sadness. The tension between his role as an oracle-for-hire and his private longing to “conduct” his own beginning runs through the piece and culminates in the final renunciation of writing. His actions (turning the shell, delaying the courier, stepping onto the balcony to shape air instead of ink) all align with that evolving motive. The only limitation is that his inner conflict is resolved with relatively little on-page resistance from external pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to break a recursive, inherited labyrinth of self—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (continuing across the viaduct, embracing the merge) align with that drive. The internal conflict between versions of self is conceptually strong but more stated than embodied; we’re told of “versions that peeled away” more than we inhabit their tensions in scene. The encounter with the hollow-eyed Elias is potent but brief, limiting how much relational pressure we feel before the merge. The final change (accepting gravity, losing the runes) is earned, but the cost could be more viscerally dramatized rather than largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—his relationship to vibration, the broken needle, and the boy’s dismissal all feel character-particular rather than generic disability angst. His core motivation (to find a way back into music/teaching despite deafness and numbness) is legible and his final choice to teach again reads as earned. The old woman is sketched efficiently as a grounded, specific guide whose status is clear in her hands and workshop. Internal conflict could be sharpened slightly on the page—there’s little active resistance once the record begins, so his turn back toward teaching feels a touch smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply etched: an aging, meticulous observer whose habits and worldview (curiosity vs non-interference, integrity vs secrecy) are dramatized in micro-choices like opening the tube and hiding the note. His emotional life is shown through embodied perception (pigeons, lavender, the recorder) rather than labels. The internal contradiction—lifelong watcher now watched—lands cleanly in the final beats. The only thing keeping this short of top-tier is that his fear and reluctance to be “found” could sharpen into one slightly more concrete, costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief, sensory vulnerability, and history with his mother are rendered with precise, embodied interiority, and his final renunciations (recorking the vial, smashing the lanterns, leaving) feel fully motivated. The "aromatically cautious" trait is dramatized rather than labeled, and his specific sensory responses (wet earth, burnt sugar, metallic tang) feel character-particular. Internal conflict between longing for his mother and fear of being unmade by scent is present, though it could surface in more explicit simultaneous contradiction at the moment he uncorks the vial. The final endurance/renunciation carries a visible cost and clearly forecloses a prior pattern of behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s worldview is specific and embodied through his tactile attention to rope, grotto, and starlight, and his “ethically playful” nature feels credible rather than cute. His internal contradiction—drifting detachment versus compulsion to engage with charged objects/choices—plays out convincingly in the rope decision and the ladder-making. The final shift from using the rope as escape/noose to shaping it into a ladder reads as an earned change of stance, with some cost in the unresolved question he carries away. The only limiter is that his emotional stakes stay more abstractly conceptual than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is particular, embodied, and motivated by a long, lonely practice of holding onto intergenerational music in the ruins; the girl’s awe gives her a live relational crucible. The stay-or-go tension is articulated but not really tested on the page, so internal contradiction stays more implied than dramatized. Her micro-choices (switching from her father’s melody to something new, aligning notes to the girl’s drawings) nicely reveal values around collaboration and the unfinished. The final “first note of tomorrow” feels earned but its cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora is sharply drawn—professional, empathic, slightly sardonic—and her key choice (to take the petal herself and give him the real ache) is well motivated by her nature and tools. The chemist is sketched efficiently through scent, gesture, and his half-truths. Internal contradiction is clearest in the chemist’s mingled cowardice and tenderness; Liora’s own conflict is more implied than dramatized, but still legible. The ending registers a credible change in him and a credible endurance in her, with some cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply sketched—his mix of mercantile instinct and inherited compassion makes his motives legible and character-specific. The librarian is more lightly drawn but still distinct through actions (repairing spines, late hours, extra coins). His decision to risk contact via the envelope/locket is well-motivated but comes with little visible internal struggle, so contradictory impulses under pressure are muted. The final shift into altruistic partnership feels earned but emotionally somewhat too smooth for top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reed’s motivation—to complete the arbor and bind herself and the village into a shared belonging—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in organizing the search despite the elders’ warning. Her interiority is mostly implied through action and image rather than deeply dramatized contradiction, which keeps her a bit cooler than she could be. The Reed/Syl mirroring via scars and craft is effective but underexplored emotionally. The final stance (not chasing Syl, accepting slow webs of kin) feels earned and in character, though the cost is gentle and could stand one sharper beat of internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elspeth’s motivation—to protect the moths, understand the echoes, and stave off the city’s collapse—is clear and consistent, and the boy’s eerie self-possession adds a sharp secondary pressure. Her choice to sacrifice the jar reads as aligned with her established sense of responsibility and history with the city. However, we get relatively little contradictory interiority or embodied emotional struggle around that decision; she moves from recognition to sacrifice with limited felt hesitation or cost on the page. The relationship dynamic with the boy is intriguing but under-explored given how pivotal their exchange is.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conjurer’s fixation on “the mathematics of emotion” yields a distinct, character-specific interiority, and his conflict between control (equations, preservation) and acceptance (ambiguity, loss) is well dramatized. His actions in the orchard—choosing to ask rather than resurrect, accepting the illusion’s dissolution—align cleanly with that conflict. The remembered details of his wife (braiding his hair, the note) are precise enough to avoid generic grief. The final renunciation (“some equations weren’t meant to balance”) feels earned rather than cheaply epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched: methodical, solitary, ruled by an ethic of preservation, and his breaking of the archives’ rules feels earned by longstanding, credible longing. His interior conflict—between “Never reveal the cache” and “suddenly needed to be the one who reached back”—is clear but could be deepened with a few more concrete, contradictory impulses in the moment of decision. The woman is more lightly sketched yet specific enough (routine, tension, always leaving early) to register as a real person rather than a prop. The final choice not to retreat embodies a meaningful change with an implied cost in exposure and broken rules.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motives—scientific curiosity, inherited responsibility, and a controlling impulse—are cleanly established and drive her choices, especially the decision to pull up the stakes and to hand the customer a leaf instead of a rose. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“her hands shook,” standing barefoot in the mud) rather than abstract. The internal conflict between control and surrender is present, though the final pivot to letting go is a touch tidy and idealized. Still, the arc feels earned within the story’s scale and length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s weary, compulsive curiosity and artistic fixation are clear and consistent, from prying up the brooch to descending the stairs and accepting the paintbrush. His insomnia, war-hauntedness, and relationship to the island all feel specific rather than generic trauma shorthand. The final acceptance of his role as the island’s “offering-picker” is earned by his prior decade of painting and his decision to follow the rain. Some deeper on-page contradiction (hesitation vs. surrender, fear vs. drive) in the chapel/cavern sequence could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motives and inner life are clear and specific: a lifelong chaser of the extraordinary who’s undone by a subtler magic. Her key choices—touching the pearl, asking “Show me,” and leaving it behind—track cleanly from that setup and result in a believable internal reconfiguration. There’s a credible before/after in how she relates to magic and to herself. Internal contradiction (her expertise vs. her blind spot) is present but could be dramatized a bit more under pressure rather than largely in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s vocation, temperament, and core desire (to assemble meaning from the city’s losses) are clear and consistent, and his shift from would-be herald to custodian of silence is well earned. The line “His hands trembled—not from cold, but from the weight of what he was about to do” grounds his interiority in a specific, embodied way. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-key; we infer his pull between proclamation and listening more than we see it contested in-scene. The final renunciation—tossing the valve—is credible and motivated, though its cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession with mapping, his grief, and his misbelief about precision outrunning loss are all clearly motivated and consistent. The key admission (“I don’t know where she went”) is earned by prior setup and shifts his stance in a believable way. Internal conflict is present—control vs. surrender to uncertainty—though it tends to be articulated rather than fully dramatized in embodied, contradictory impulses. His relationship with the sister is moving but sketched; she functions more as a thematic figure than a pressured relationship on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s grief, skepticism, and technical precision as a stargazer all inform her choices, and her shift from denial to active engagement with memory feels earned. Moments like deciding to transcribe “not as a spell, but as a rebellion against silence” reveal layered motivation. The internal conflict between disbelief and yearning could be sharpened with one or two more moments of genuine resistance near the climax, as she yields to the tile’s possibilities a bit smoothly. Still, she reads as specific, embodied, and psychologically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysander’s boredom, age, and pattern of perpetual leaving are sharply drawn and motivate his choice to drop the fragment. The internal conflict—fascination with rebellion vs. fear of truly “letting go”—is present but could be dramatized a little more in-scene rather than mostly in summary (“He had spent lifetimes leaving things behind…”). His decisive change at the end (reframing goodbye, accepting the void’s question) feels earned and character-specific. The lack of any on-page relational crucible keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lira’s characterization is rich and specific: the “con artist’s kid” who thinks in equations of risk and fairness, pulled between her father’s legacy and her own ethics. Her motivation—to invert the math of his cons and make a fair trade—clearly drives her choices with credible ambivalence (“Twelve lives for one ledger. A fair trade?”). The girl is vivid but more emblematic than deeply individuated, functioning mainly as pressure and mirror. The final shift from “me” to “them” feels earned, though the emotional cost of unleashing chaos could be slightly more internally contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer’s motivation—to catch time via “textures”—is specific, consistent, and embodied in his meticulous note-taking and bonsai curation. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“like pulling a drowned thing from the river and watching it gasp back to life”). However, there is minimal true internal conflict or visible cost; his compulsion is shown, but it never forces a hard trade-off or contradiction in him. The final stance (doubling down on listening and inventing) feels earned but emotionally low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Daniel’s erasure and compulsion to collect others’ fragments create a coherent, particular inner life, and his final act of embedding the label/page feels motivated by that arc. However, his interior conflict stays mostly on one register—haunted, observant, resigned—without much on-page contradiction or struggle between competing impulses. The cost of his choice (leaning into ghosthood vs. reclaiming identity) is more implied than dramatized. The result is strong, but not yet as knotted or pressured as it could be for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s contradiction—myth buster who secretly wants a miracle—is vivid, and his shift to “myth keeper” feels earned through the shell/cello interaction rather than arbitrary. His embodied responses (laughing jaggedly instead of panicking as the journal dissolves) are specific and character-particular. The final choice to stop scrambling for the pages and instead play/write on his skin credibly forecloses his old stance. The only limit is that the internal conflict resolves a bit swiftly once the shell “tells” him the new frame.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motives and inner split between order and Lumina’s chaos are vivid and consistent, embodied in the brass cuff, the chip, and her graffiti tactics. Her contradictory impulses—love of structure vs loyalty to the city’s fluidity—coexist on the page and credibly crystallize in the closing recommitment to “building a third” way. Jax is thin but functional as a foil rather than a full character. The emotional cost of her stance could be shaded a bit more sharply in the final beats to reach a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to witness and preserve the crater before exploitation—is clear and consistently expressed through his ritual with the canister and photographs. Interiority is vivid in places (“each click was a theft, a defiance”) and his restraint at the end (“Men of the space age didn’t cry…”) is character-specific. However, he remains largely single-toned (stoic, elegiac) with limited on-page contradiction or messier impulses under pressure. The final endurance/renunciation—leaving with only knowledge and photos—is earned but emotionally could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a competent, modest savant whose habits (the chipped teacup, the water barrel, his bond with Lumen) feel specific and lived-in. His motivation to correct the ship’s flaw is clear and consistent with his identity as a mender. What’s missing at this tier is meaningful internal contradiction or visible emotional cost; he never truly struggles or wavers. The result is rich characterization but a little too serenely unconflicted for top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s characterization is specific and coherent—the atlas editor who sees patterns in condensation and phrasing feels lived-in, and her choice to accept the “herald” role grows organically from that mindset. Motivation (finding beginnings, distrusting “coincidence”) is clear and threads the whole piece. What’s missing, slightly, is a sharper sense of internal conflict or hesitation at the peak; she moves from recognition to acceptance with little visible struggle. The ending renunciation (stepping into the water, leaving her old life) is earned but emotionally underplayed, keeping this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tuner’s motivation—to revive and rebalance the town—is clear, consistent, and filtered through his craft and worldview (“revival was not a shout but a rhythm, not a command but a conversation”). Interiority is mostly conveyed through action and metaphor rather than direct thought, which suits the piece’s lyric mode. However, we see little true internal contradiction or sharp emotional cost; his patience is asserted and embodied but not meaningfully tested beyond fatigue. The ending’s acceptance of endless labor reads as an earned stance, but its emotional complexity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s guilt, need for erasure, and reckless drive are sharply drawn and consistently embodied (“to let the pressure crush the guilt from her bones”). Her conflicting impulses—fleeing vs unsnarling the vial, seeking the hush vs fearing its cost—play out in concrete micro-choices. The arc from desperate self-rewrite to quiet endurance and refusal to answer the signal reads earned and specific. A minor softness is that her life with Elias and the team remains slightly abstract, so the relationship pressure could be grounded in one more concrete, particularized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to rewrite the story around his father’s name and his village’s curse—is clear and consistently dramatized (“I want to change the beginning”). His comfort with the uncanny (“He’d been raised on voices that weren’t there”) individualizes him. The main limitation is that his internal conflict is underplayed; he rarely wavers or feels genuinely torn, so contradictory impulses don’t fully peak on the page. The final choice to lie truthfully lands, but with slightly less visible emotional cost than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation (answering the bead’s call to wake Vesper) is clear, consistent, and beautifully embodied in her costly returns, and the keeper’s reactions add a grounded counterpoint. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; Liora never seriously wavers or reveals competing impulses on the page. Vesper is more image than psyche, though their presence does refract who Liora has been over time. The final renunciation—Liora unraveling so Vesper can stand—reads earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is richly drawn as a man of “frayed edges” whose compulsion to mend and weave ruin into meaning is consistent across the piece. His optimism and stubborn tenderness toward broken things motivate both his sleepwalking ritual and his final waking choice to leave the “cradle.” Internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply dramatized; he rarely doubts or resists, so we don’t see strongly contradictory impulses in scene. Still, the final shift from unconscious weaving to conscious agency feels earned by the accumulated portrayal of his nature.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (roots, memory, quiet skepticism about miracles) are clear and consistently embodied in his choices—digging, following roots, planting the seed, choosing to go deeper. His interiority is specific (“didn’t believe in miracles, but he believed in roots”) and his sensory reactions feel lived. However, internal contradiction is relatively mild; there’s little real friction between doubt and hope beyond a stated stance that shifts smoothly. The change at the end (accepting this as a beginning) feels earned but comes with limited on-page cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena is sharply sketched through her chosen name, low-tech preferences, and vocation; interiority is concrete and particular (“because it sounded like a place you could leave”). Motivation—to give people names that function as escape and anchor—is clear and consistent with her occupational detail. The small internal conflict around releasing the name at the mailbox is present but relatively gentle, so contradictory impulses don’t fully peak. The final endurance/renunciation (letting the name go, erasing the chalk) is credible but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is vivid and motivated—his commitment to the stars and to stories clearly drives every choice, especially his refusal to run and his decision to broadcast. His interiority is more archetypal than psychologically contradictory; we rarely feel genuine fear or doubt, so internal conflict stays muted. The courier functions well as a pressure-delivering secondary figure, though she’s more a device than a fully realized person. The cost at the end—his likely death and loss of the observatory—is credibly earned by his prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are clear and particular: she fetishizes the safety of the “moment before deciding” yet aches for connection, and every micro-choice (pressing the shard, evoking the words, relinquishing the letter) arises from that tension. Her interiority is sensuous and embodied rather than diagnostic, with the mediumship filtered through her relationship to regret. The choice to let the letter go without contacting her sister feels emotionally earned, foreclosing a path with cost. The only minor limitation is that the final loosening of her long-held ambivalence comes a touch smoothly, without one last sharper snag or irrational backslide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena is sharply etched: a trauma-tempered translator whose history in conflict zones plausibly underpins her present “unknotting” work. Her motives—reframing others’ pain while managing her own—are clear and consistent, and the shrapnel injury plus anesthetic detail ground her interiority in the body. The micro-choices (reading the cast, rephrasing the father’s static, how she interprets the brother’s scribbles, giving away the coral) reveal a coherent value hierarchy. The only limiter is that her internal contradiction—compassion vs. self-erasure—is more implied than actively contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation—to use light to recover and share lost joy—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete choices (taking the fragment, experimenting with the film, then staging the orchard display). Interiority is specific and sensate rather than abstract, but she experiences little true internal contradiction or doubt, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow. Her final stance (seeing the ruin as promise and recommitting to new paints) feels earned but low-cost. The absence of on-page relational friction slightly limits the crucible effect on her character.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s core tension—preserver vs. creator, certainty vs. curiosity—is clearly established and her choices (pressing the nickel to the sculpture, touching the painted nickel, choosing to paint a door, stepping through it) track cleanly with that motivation. Interiority is concrete (“escape the weight of certainty”) and embodied via her craft, though moments of reflection occasionally move toward summary rather than live contradiction. The fig-woman and old man function more as archetypal guides than full characters, but that suits the piece’s scale and mode. The final acceptance of the cycle feels earned, with the cost of leaving her old world implied rather than on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vividly sketched—a rogue, wry, principled scholar whose choices (repurposing the greenhouse, organizing the gardens, answering the “they know” warning by continuing) clearly stem from his defiant temperament. Interiority is present but fairly streamlined; he rarely shows simultaneous contradictory impulses or visible fear, which flattens emotional complexity. Secondary figures (botanist, librarian, teen) are flavorful but function mostly as chorus, not active pressure. The ending suggests ongoing risk but doesn’t dramatize a specific, painful foreclosed option for Elias personally.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s motivation—to alchemize war’s pain into beauty—is vivid and consistently dramatized in her choices to sing louder, write the manual, and engage the ghost. Her interiority is textured through image rather than abstract labels, and she feels particular rather than archetypal. However, her internal conflict is muted; she largely enacts a stable ethic rather than wrestling with competing impulses on the page. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis, but the cost is conceptual more than viscerally embodied in her.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s motivations and vocation are clear and consistent, and her final renunciation (breaking the chime) feels earned by the prior setup of her life’s work. Interiority is mostly conveyed through sensory-laden perception rather than explicit thought, which works, but her contradictory impulses (duty to preserve vs fear of what she’s unleashed) could be dramatized a touch more explicitly under peak pressure. The moment of understanding that “some things were not meant to be preserved. Only mourned.” credibly reconfigures her identity at real cost. Overall she reads as particular, not generic, though we stay in a fairly narrow emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motivation and “carefully reckless” nature are vividly established and consistently drive her choices, especially the decision to sing despite the archive’s revealed danger. The interiority is concrete and specific (e.g., “not from fear, but from the weight of what she was about to restore”). Her final shift—from distrusting her voice to laughing with surety—feels earned by the on-page ordeal. The only limit is that her internal contradiction (fear of harm vs compulsion to act) could be dramatized under slightly sharper pressure before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motives and values are clear and specific—her engineering pride, loyalty to her father’s gentler vision, and hunger to redeem his “betrayal” all track cleanly into the final choice. Her interiority is textured (reading glue as “a language,” feeling the chain as promise), and the conflict between safety, approval, and compassion is credible. The cost of defying the elders is implied rather than deeply embodied on the page, which softens the impact of her decision. The elders themselves are sketched effectively but remain mostly functional pressures rather than fully realized foils.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific: the tension between his past as a composer and his present as a pigeon trainer shows in small embodied choices (hands steady only for grain and harnesses, lying about ledgers, whispering a route instead of speaking of Luca). His motives—avoidance of pain, clinging to controlled routines, longing for Luca and music—are consistent and drive his actions toward the final hum. The relationship to Madame Holloway adds a credible external pressure and status dynamic without stealing focus. The only limitation is that the conflict with Luca remains mostly off-page, so the emotional cost of “maestro” to “liar” is powerful but summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s mix of rational design (“labyrinth of necessary distances”) and superstition/intuition under pressure feels specific and drives credible choices, especially his decision not to ask if Liora is coming back. Liora’s eerie precocity (“Some doors only open when you stop looking”) is consistent, though her exact motives remain more mythic than psychologically grounded. The father–daughter dynamic is legible and charged in their brief reunion, with his restraint at the ladder’s bottom reading as a real, if quiet, cost. A bit more on-page contradiction in Elias—panic versus belief—would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives (mapping currents as belonging, staying in the drowned lab) are clear and particular, and her quiet shift from solitary observer to someone who lets her hand be held feels earned. The feather, the maps, and her attention to the “respite” all reveal a coherent psyche. Internal conflict (craving connection yet self-exiled) is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized. Kael remains more symbolic than fully individuated, limiting relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recollectionist has a clear, particular motive and a coherent interior texture—her curiosity, gentleness, and latent complicity with the cave’s logic feel integrated with her choices (handling the seeds, taking in the memories, deciding to leave). The moment when her blood glows and she realizes the missing pieces were “inside her all along” is emotionally legible and earned by prior beats, though the formulation is somewhat familiar. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; she wonders about kindness vs. fragility of the universe but never has to act against a strong opposing impulse. The final acceptance of the burden of “a thousand half-remembered lives” registers as a real, if quietly drawn, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lior is sharply sketched as an obsessive pattern-worker whose primary motive—playing not for coins but to manipulate contingency—is clear and consistent. His interiority is more conceptual than emotionally conflicted, so we get little sense of competing impulses or real vulnerability beyond being misunderstood. The brief exchange with the moth-shawled woman hints at relational stakes but doesn’t meaningfully alter him. The final stance (continuing to play for an inhuman “listener”) feels earned but low-cost, closer to a character portrait than an arc.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tide dancer’s interiority is specific and grounded in her elective exile, guilt, and hunger to transform (“penance for reading the tides too well,” “memory was a kind of drowning”). Her micro-choices—grinding the jewel long ago, coming to the pond, choosing sky over sea—track cleanly with those motives. Emotional states are embodied through actions and sensory focus rather than labels. The main limitation is that her internal conflict (fear vs desire) is implied more than explicitly tested on the page, keeping this shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched through work-specific perception and ritualized behavior, with his love for his daughter and need for meaning grounding every choice. His motivation—to keep reading the bay and preserving the atrium as a way to make the mundane matter—feels specific and embodied. Internal contradiction is quieter: he denies “magic” yet behaves as if what he does borders on it, which could be pushed further under pressure. The final endurance (turning toward the day, reaching for another stone) is credible, though the emotional cost could land even harder with one more moment of fraying or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched: the burned firefighter whose scars mirror the forest’s, carrying a believable mix of guilt, avoidance, and tenderness. His micro-choices—the decision to bring the box, to open it, to draw, to text Lila, to leave the box—track cleanly with that interior conflict. The internal question (“How do you hand pain…”) risks slight abstraction, but the story earns it by tying it tightly to embodied action with the box and the stone drawings. The final renunciation (leaving the box, walking toward the untouched valley) feels like a credible, costly shift away from stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora is specific and vivid: a “logical dreamer” whose inheritance of the gauge and obsession with equations for hope feel organically tied. Her motives are clear and consistent—testing and reconfiguring hope as if it were a solvable problem. Internal change (from frustrated equation-scribbler to someone who understands hope as dynamic potential) is believable, if gently rendered. The main limitation is a lack of sharply dramatized internal contradiction or visible cost beyond relinquishing her prior conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s vocation, family history, and longing to understand the walls’ “dreams” create a coherent, specific psychology. His avoidance of his parents’ memory versus his compulsion to listen to spaces gives him a credible internal conflict that sharpens around the negative and the sealed door. Actions (following the hum, opening the door, staying to redraw the mural) feel motivated rather than convenient. The emotional register stays embodied and particular, though his peak choices could bear a touch more torn-ness on the page to fully maximize complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s characterization is rich: her ethical calculus around borrowed heartbeats, her refusal to look at her own possibilities, and her ritualized stillness all feel specific and earned. Motivation (providing mirages while managing their cost) is clear and consistent, and micro-choices like dropping the mirror before it can show her face reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction—needing the work yet fearing her own reflection—is present but could be pushed slightly harder on the page for maximal impact. Secondary figures (the mother, the soldier) are offstage but still exert credible pressure through their traces in her work.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Veyra and Kael are sharply etched, their shared history and weariness made specific through the notched clipboard and the recalled line “for the children we haven’t buried yet.” Their motivations—end the war versus distrust of treaties—are clear and consistently embodied in gesture (his hand on the hilt, her ritual calm). Internal contradiction is present but somewhat stated rather than fully dramatized (e.g., Veyra’s admission “Probably” hints at complicity but isn’t deeply explored in her interiority). The final endurance choice—she continues the work despite believing it will likely fail—feels earned, though not pushed to maximal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—architect of scarcity performing a tiny, irrational act of preservation—is sharply drawn without over-explaining him. Lines like “Not out of guilt. / Not out of hope.” crystallize a believable self-deception that matches his “careful, amoral math.” The micro-choice to entrust the egg to salt rather than vault or self is specific and character-revealing. I might want one slightly more embodied beat of hesitation to deepen the emotional cost of that act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation—to defy enforced silence and free forbidden voices—is clear, consistent, and embodied through her precise, ritual-like actions with the threads. Her emotional texture skews toward calm competence with light irony (“She had been called worse”), which fits but leaves internal contradiction underexplored. The choice to absorb the echoes and accept their weight feels earned and coherent with her “chaste courtesan” self-mastery. I most felt her as an individual in the way she handles the warnings in the threads without flinching, suggesting a long-habituated relationship to risk and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias reads as a specific, lived-in artist whose ethics and craft are tightly linked, with concrete micro-choices (returning to the bar, choosing to “let the puppets stumble”). His internal conflict between control and harm is clear and character-specific rather than generic. The miner’s offstage accusation provides a sharp, motivating wound that feels earned. The final stance shift is convincing but perhaps a bit too cleanly articulated for someone still in active moral confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lior’s motivation—to honor what the world forgets—is precise, consistent, and drives every choice from constructing the spiral to staying to watch it unravel. His “not grief, not exactly” stance and esoteric realist identity give him a particular, believable interiority. The Earned Stasis at the end (he recommits to this fragile, futile practice) feels true to his character, though internal conflict could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine doubt or temptation to stop.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s motivation—to atone for her complicity in the language’s death and to preserve the lost names—runs cleanly through every choice, especially her decision to “reconfigure” rather than simply unravel the rope. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“the way a lost wax casting remembers the hollow it once filled”), avoiding stock emotion. The internal conflict between clinging to purity of preservation and accepting change is clearly dramatized in the act of altering the ancestral rope. The one slight limit is that her flaw (silence/rigidity) is primarily relayed rather than tested against an on-page opposing person or force, keeping the crucible mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lior’s motivation (curiosity about the storm/paths and the grandmother’s riddle) is clear and consistent, and her shift from seeking explanations to surrendering certainty is earned. The line “You were always the one who asked why” crisply crystallizes her flaw and desire. Internal contradiction (wanting answers vs needing to relinquish them) is present but mostly conceptual rather than fully embodied in messy, scene-level impulses. I’d like one more grounded, irrational reaction under pressure to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Qishti is sharply etched—a frugal, aging astronomer whose habits (counting tiles, ink-stained robes) and worldview shape every action—and his arc from cautious empiricist to someone who kneels before the unknown feels earned. The internal tension between his scientific reflex and the quasi-religious threshold is present (“a threshold not of science but of faith”), though it could be stressed more pointedly at the descent and altar moments. His motivation for pursuing the mystery (understanding rather than treasure) is clear and consistent. The main limitation is that the emotional cost of his final shift is more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior’s motivations and contradictions are sharply etched: he both clings to and rejects resentment, dramatized in his breaking and then replacing the pin. His relationship with Kael is specific and textured—child vs. scarred adult versions, with clear status shifts in the dialogue. The emotional turn toward tentative grace feels mostly earned by prior beats, though the reconciliation borders on tidy given the depth of the grievance hinted. Kael is slightly more emblem than fully individuated person, but still functions well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-POV interiority is rich and particular, with the mirror maker’s grief, guilt, and ambivalence embodied through his tactile engagement with tools, fog, and memory. Motivation—to escape memory yet also resurrect/understand his brother—is coherent and drives all choices, especially the surrender to fog and final step through the “door.” Internal conflict between grounding and dissolution is present but could be sharpened with one more explicit moment of resistance before he yields. The relationship to the brother is vivid despite his physical absence, mainly through the sextant and recalled line, giving the arc emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mender’s interiority is specific and embodied—the trembling fingers, the ache at the daughter’s “endearingly feisty” chin—and their motive to understand/repair with the daughter is clear and consistent. Contradictory impulses (duty to vows vs. loyalty to the daughter’s autonomy) are dramatized rather than told, especially around the priests’ contract and the apple. The final choice to take the ribbon, bite the apple, and leave the doll is an earned reconfiguration of their earlier stance, with a visible cost in pride and certainty. The daughter exists only via memory and magic-voice, but still feels particular rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veyra’s curiosity and long-term entanglement with anomalous artifacts are clear and specific, and her willingness to lean into danger feels earned (“Danger was the point.”). Her core motivation—to understand and engage with forbidden knowledge—stays coherent and drives every choice. Internal contradiction (wariness vs. hunger) is present but lightly sketched, so her final stance costs her more conceptually than emotionally on the page. The lack of a more embodied, conflicting emotional beat at the peak keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as brilliant, exploitative, and attuned to absences; his willingness to weaponize the traveler’s grief is convincing and morally uncompromising. Motivation (beat the traveler to the Library, steal its power) is clean and drives his tactics. The late, stunned realization that he’s become “a gap” reads as earned stasis more than a radical transformation, but the final weeping and forgotten name land with credible cost. The traveler is thinner but sufficient as a pressure source rather than a co-equal character.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s motive to reclaim her twin is clear and consistent, and her handling of the swatch and ledger shows concrete, goal-directed micro-choices. However, her interiority remains mostly single-note—driven and haunted—without much on-page contradiction or hesitation under pressure. The sister is more image than person, so the reunion carries more conceptual than relational nuance. The final choice to stay and speak for all the lost names is moving but could carry sharper felt cost or ambivalence in Liora’s inner life.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is sharply sketched—"a woman who thrived in the spaces between what was recorded and what was lost"—and her archivist mindset plausibly drives her puzzle-solving and her final renunciation of recording. Her actions (unbraiding/rebraiding the rope, stepping through, accepting merger) track cleanly with that characterization. Internal contradiction is present but faint: she moves from cataloging to embodiment with relatively little visible resistance, so the cost of that shift feels more implied than dramatized. A touch more friction or fear around “becoming part of it” would fully earn the transformation at this prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eldrin’s motivation (preservation, not escape) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his occupational lens as a mapkeeper is well realized. However, his interior life remains relatively simple—there’s little on-page contradiction, moral ambiguity, or visible flaw complicating his dedication. The emotional beats (trembling fingers, controlled breath) are embodied but quite measured, keeping him closer to archetype than fully individuated person. The final “rest” feels earned but low-cost because we haven’t seen him truly torn.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The custodian’s loneliness, stubborn hope, and retrocognitive burden are rendered with concrete, specific interiority ("just another kind of loneliness—seeing echoes of what had been, but never what could be"). Her core motivation—to rekindle the beacon in search of meaning—is clear and her actions consistently pursue that. Internal conflict exists but is relatively soft; she never seriously contemplates not trying, so contradiction under pressure is muted. The closing shift in her understanding of what the beacon is for feels earned by prior experience, if a bit tidily articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Summer-Quill’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, from her “preemptively nostalgic” self-diagnosis to the way she uses others’ memories to sand her own edges. Her core motivation—to fix a self through collecting—is clear and organically leads to the renunciation at the end. The shift from measuring/conjecturing to simply listening feels earned by the offered memory and the river/vault reframing. The only limit is that her internal conflict stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through sharper embodied contradiction in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is sharply drawn through vocation, habits, and sensory focus; her motivation to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” coheres with her history of chasing light. Her choices (climbing, reading the mosaic, lighting the knot, launching rockets) are motivated and consistent. Internal conflict is relatively muted—she doesn’t significantly doubt or waver—so the arc leans more toward steadfast endurance than a charged contradiction. The final sense that “the world was heavier… But so was she” gives credible, if quiet, change and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chronicler is vivid, internally consistent, and particular in perception, with her motives (attunement to transitions, reluctance to answer bluntly) clearly driving her choices. Her quiet conflict—between speaking directly and honoring the subtler “texture of time”—is embodied in the decision to give the cicada rather than answer the fisherman’s question. The fisherman himself is more sketched than developed, but his grief and status relative to her are legible and effective. The endurance/renunciation at the end (she keeps chronicling; he carries the cicada) feels earned and carries a soft but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The child’s inner logic—equating safety with shrinking and seeking silences as expansion—is vivid and specific, and their choices (climbing, taking the bloom, opening the bunker) are consistently motivated. The collecting of silence-flavors works as a defining quirk that becomes a moral vector rather than a gimmick. What holds this short of top tier is the underdeveloped emotional contradiction around the father at the climax; the decision to leave him carries concept-level cost but almost no felt tug-of-war on the page. A bit more simultaneous attachment and revolt in that final beat would deepen the characterization significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is rendered with specific, embodied competence and a clear, if mostly implicit, motivation: he has “spent thirty years learning the language of stillness” and now practices that craft on behalf of others. His choices with the dial, the spoon, and his sparse but pointed speech all arise organically from that vocation. The passenger is deliberately more archetypal, which fits the design but keeps the relational pressure and mutual contradiction relatively soft. The ending gives him an Earned Stasis—continuing the work with a slightly “lighter” terrace—rather than a sharp internal turn, which is appropriate but limits upper-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elsin’s motives (preserve lore, avert a corrupt ascension) are clear, consistent, and drive each choice, and we see her competence and history through concrete actions like decoding murals and operating the hatch. The key turn—choosing to unmake the throne instead of claim it—feels meaningfully rooted in her identity as the last lore keeper. However, her internal conflict at the climax is relatively smooth; there’s limited on-page struggle between temptation and renunciation once she “understood now.” A touch more contradictory impulse under peak pressure would raise both complexity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lior’s interiority is specific and coherent: the “clean” silence after his first accidental cutoff and the accumulated shadows as “stones in his pockets” make his withdrawal feel both seductive and costly. His final choice—to turn the ring and step through—flows from the established contradiction between his role as a “tender shadow keeper” and his compulsion to burn bridges. The visible cost (abandoning the sanctuary and the protective isolation he’s built) is legible, though the emotional ambivalence at that moment could be textured a bit further. Overall, he feels like a real, flawed person rather than a thematic mouthpiece.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lina is sharply etched: a pyramid-scheme survivor whose history with her mother and *Luminous Ascent* clearly shapes her suspicion, leverage-minded thinking, and attraction to mischief. Her contradictory impulses—wariness of promises vs. curiosity and defiance—are dramatized in the way she texts back, twists the bolt, and ultimately refuses to check the final message. The closing stance (walking into the desert with the diamond, ignoring the buzz) feels earned and forecloses the path of endlessly translating other people’s “pressure.” Minor limitation: her emotional reaction to the terrifying Eidolon vision could be slightly more embodied to fully match the intensity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is particular and consistent—his sense of himself as “dynasty ender” and his skepticism about the “bridge of intuition” are well seeded and then revised. His motive (to understand his legacy and the hidden truth implied by the letters) is clear and governs each micro-choice with the crank and mirror. What’s missing for a higher score is live contradiction on the page: he pivots from doubt to acceptance very smoothly, with little felt resistance or emotional mess. The final shift from failure to “first to cross” is earned conceptually but could carry more visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The knight’s silence, guilt from the siege-performance, and reluctance to join the “allegiance” create a coherent, particular interiority, and his choices (unsnapping the gauntlet, speaking, stepping onto the stage) feel motivated by that history. The blend of weariness, fear, and stubborn refusal to applaud gives him a distinct psychological texture. However, his internal conflict at the decisive moment is more implied than fully dramatized on the page, which slightly blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the posture, the archivist habits, and the echo of his own closed file make him feel particular and lived-in. His motivation—to gently counter institutional erasure—flows cleanly from his history and job. The main limitation is that his internal conflict stays relatively soft; we never quite see him tempted to look away or to remain purely clerical. Still, his choice to act (researching, sending the envelope, and then opening Maria’s file with new intent) reads as an earned, character-rooted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena is sharply sketched as an underestimated, methodical archivist whose "insignificance" is her survival strategy, and her choices clearly drive the plot. However, her interior conflict is relatively low-friction—she repeatedly insists she is “not a hero” but rarely wavers or contradicts herself in the moment, so the final stance feels more affirmed than earned. Embodied emotion is present but often summarized in declarative lines (“She wasn’t a hero. But she was…”) rather than dramatized through conflicted impulses. The relationship with Rook is mostly conceptual, providing stakes but little relational crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The saxophonist’s core drive—to hush the prophecy and then to keep answering its call—is clear and consistent, and the final fear of “true silence” is a strong, character-specific note. His history with the grotto and the woman’s prophecy gives him texture beyond a generic mystic protagonist. However, his internal conflict (wanting the prophecy gone yet returning to serve it) stays more implied than dramatized in specific contradictory impulses in-scene. Embodied emotion leans heavily on atmosphere rather than concrete bodily reactions under strain, which slightly flattens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s vocation and temperament are sharply etched through tactile actions—sorting by the “stories they carried,” building a monument of singing seeds, eating the sapling’s leaf. Her acceptance of enormous responsibility and bodily transformation feels internally consistent, but the lack of visible hesitation or contradiction (“Liora didn’t flinch”) flattens potential complexity. Emotional states are largely implied via ritual rather than dramatized conflict, which keeps her just shy of fully three-dimensional. The final choice to jump reads credible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tinkerer’s compulsion to fix broken things is specific, embodied (trembling hands, pockets full of gears), and consistently motivates his choices down to the final renunciation of “fixing.” His shift from needing control to accepting uncertainty is clearly earned through the accumulating encounters with the clock, compass, and waterfall. The internal conflict—comfort in brokenness vs craving a plan—could surface a touch more sharply under direct pressure, but it’s present and coherent. The resting choice at the end reads as credible endurance/renunciation with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation—professional rivalry braided with fear of “the weight” of a name—is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially staying after the search party and risking the crucible. Interiority is specific and character-linked (her alchemical lens on balance, kintsugi, and transmutation of self). The arc from dismissal of Veyra’s “sentimental” kintsugi to embracing self-transmutation is earned, though the realization edges toward tidy insight. A bit more on-page resistance or uglier contradiction at the crucible decision could deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is sharply etched: a reluctant collector, shaped by maternal loss, with “modest fearlessness” and a specific way of relating to the dead. Her motives (following the warped laughter, seeking not just release but rightness) are coherent and embodied in small choices like scattering petals and asking for a joke. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—she bears grief as collection, yet chooses integration—so the emotional crucible never bites as hard as it could. The closing lightness of her satchel feels earned, though the cost remains subtle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liran’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“proprioception screaming” and the torture-conditioned knee/throat responses feel particular and lived. His core motive (to survive and integrate the “mathematics of mercy” his captors sought) is clear and carries through to the shrine scene. The earned shift from shaking, fragmented survivor to someone who can walk out steady with a re-signified strap reads as a genuine before/after. Internal contradiction (rage vs. mercy, fear vs. willingness to submit to penance) is present but could be surfaced more explicitly in on-page micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lior’s motivation (seeking an anchor, honoring overlooked histories) is clear and consistent, and her perceptual habits (“translating between worlds—not with words, but…”) feel character-specific. However, internal conflict is muted: we seldom see contradictory impulses under pressure, just steady receptivity. The closing shift—from bridge/translator to active retriever of the “between”—is earned but emotionally low-temperature. A touch more friction or cost in her choices would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is distinct—a blue-collar horologist/technician who reads dust and ghosts—with clear, consistent motivation (inspect the “fatigue,” then free the mechanism’s captives once he grasps the stakes). His choices (listening at the ceiling, opening the seam, deciding to “unmake”) feel earned and aligned with his particular skill set. However, internal contradiction is minimal; his shift from inspector to saboteur is believable but emotionally under-explored beyond trembling hands. A touch more visible ambivalence or personal cost at the decisive moment would deepen him.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s role, history, and immediate motive (stopping or channeling the rupture via the forbidden whisper) are clear and consistent, and his final decision to let the library fall feels motivated by his lifelong containment work. However, interior contradiction is mostly implied rather than dramatized—he moves through events with a near-serene competence, so we don’t feel much messy push-pull between fear, duty, pride, or despair on the page. The realization that “the system wasn’t the world. It was him.” is conceptually strong but arrives as a clean revelation more than the culmination of visible internal struggle. The cost—allowing himself and the library to dissolve—is legible and fits his arc, but a more embodied, conflicted emotional beat under pressure would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—shifting from failed revolutionary to guardian/revisionist of his culture—is clear, specific, and consistently borne out in his choices. His history as “a poet before he was a revolutionary” colors how he responds to defeat, and the final acceptance of beauty in time feels earned. Internal contradiction (vengeance vs revision, grief vs aesthetic awe) is present but could be dramatized more actively in-scene rather than primarily summarized. Taelis functions effectively as a foil, though the relationship pressure is brief and could sharpen his conflicts further.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s vocation and worldview (“mending what isn’t torn”) give him a strong, particular interior life, and his choice to press the stone to his chest is clearly rooted in that history. His acceptance of cost (“Elias understood hunger… But he was a fool”) feels earned rather than convenient. Internal contradiction—his compulsion to fix versus the recognition that this must end—registers, though it’s gestured to more than deeply dramatized. At this length, he’s vivid and specific, but the emotional struggle could sharpen one more notch before his self-immolating choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—he’s driven by grief, inherited obsession, and a need to test his father’s mystery—and the final renunciation (burning the notes, “collecting silence”) feels earned. His interiority is specific enough (“He feared the explanations that wouldn’t come”) but rarely contradictory; we see more of his convictions than of live, in-the-moment ambivalence. Psychometry, his profession, and his relationship to his father do inform his choices rather than sitting as labels. The arc lands as an earned stasis/renunciation, but an elite version would show sharper internal friction as he confronts the arch.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and sensibility are clear and particular—his driftwood work, curiosity about the slide, and instinct to leave a carving all feel of a piece. Interiority is embodied in his tactile relationship with wood and stone, not abstract labels. However, he faces little real internal contradiction; his shift from skepticism to understanding happens smoothly without much visible resistance. The final choice to contribute his own “layer” is earned but relatively low-cost and emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation—to understand the night-blooming flowers and the silence around them—is clear and consistent, and her quiet obsession with the window and murals feels rooted in character. Interiority is concrete and sensory rather than abstract, with good use of embodied perception (pigment-stained fingers, bare feet in melting snow). The final renunciation (not painting the jasmine, leaving the pavilion) is earned but carries relatively little felt cost on the page. Internal contradiction (need to understand vs. need to be still) is present but could be sharper and more conflicted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—a weary, principled archivist whose history with “silences of history” grounds his motives and gives his choices weight. His shift from archivist to “medium” and finally to someone who releases truth rather than hoarding it is credible and foreshadowed. Internal contradiction (duty to preserve vs. ethical need to free) is present but could be dramatized more viscerally in the lagoon scene itself. The Historical Revision Board officers are functional antagonists rather than characters, but they apply clear pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s motive—refusing false comfort yet unable to relinquish the town—is clear and consistently dramatized through his attention to the bottle and his disciplined concentration. His interiority is specific (“working memory was his crucible now”) and embodied enough (creak of bones, sticky child’s hand) to feel lived. There’s some room for deeper contradiction or sharper cost at the end—he transitions fairly smoothly from isolation to purpose without much on-page resistance. Still, his final choice to let the bottle go and accept ongoing work reads earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched: an aging, meticulous oath scribe whose craft and memory shape every perception; his fear at being called “the hinge” is specific and embodied. Motivation—to preserve the shapes of vows—is clear and credibly drives his rituals and choices. Internal conflict (duty to archive vs dread of prophecy and hubris) is present but remains relatively low-key, mostly at the level of attitude rather than a wrenching dilemma. The final choice not to record the prophecy but to preserve his fear instead reads earned and character-specific, though the emotional cost could be shaded slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s motives (protecting the seed-hoard, resisting the vortex that consumed her mother) are clear and drive every action, and her embodied focus (“furiously tranquil”) feels specific. However, her interiority skews toward unwavering resolve; we get little simultaneous push-pull between fear, grief, and defiance in the peak beats. The final serenity is earned but relatively smooth, with limited sense of an alternative path she’s giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated by responsibility and a near-obsessive attentiveness; his choice to rework the bindings against what the abbot would approve is well-grounded in the preceding interiority. Interiority is specific and embodied (“his calloused fingers tracing the stone,” feeling the bell’s hum), though his emotional palette stays mostly in one register of quiet competence. The “credibly curious” label is supported by his methods and night of calculations, but he’s not strongly torn between competing impulses in the moment. The closing endurance—waiting out the storm, trusting his work—reads as a believable, modestly costly stance rather than a transformative change.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Eli’s motives and worldview are clear and consistent, and his choice to stay with the star and later leave the station grows organically from his long, solitary devotion. However, he experiences relatively little genuine internal contradiction under pressure—he is affirmed more than tested—so the final realization about vulnerability feels more like a crystallization than a hard-won reversal. Embodied emotion is mostly strong (“his breath a cloud of vulnerability”), but a few insights drift toward generalized aphorism. The cost of his choice (risking protocols, leaving his life’s post) is present but could be felt more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beekeeper’s motivation—guarding a wordless covenant through lifelong silence—is specific, coherent, and tracked cleanly to his key choice around opening the box. Interiority is mostly implied through gesture and history rather than explicit thought, but it still feels character-particular. The Earned Stasis of “He did not speak. / He never would.” is thematically and emotionally credible, though his inner contradictions (doubt, anger, temptation) remain somewhat underexplored on the page. The ghosts function more as a pressure-field than individuated characters, which fits but limits relational nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific (the ritual with the dead watch, the ache of “running out” of time) and his curiosity and grief plausibly drive his actions. His role as a timekeeper under pressure from a broken world feels character-particular, not generic. The final change—accepting there is “work to do” in continuing Marlen’s unraveling—is emotionally earned but the cost of that choice (what he sacrifices, or risks) is only lightly implied rather than felt. A touch more contradiction or resistance in him undercutting the neatness of the epiphany would deepen this.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s sensibility and motivation—his compulsion to collect and honor broken things—are specific, coherent, and enacted through concrete choices (taking the feather, ignoring the snapped kite at first, retrieving it later). Interiority feels organic to his temperament, not generic “writerly angst.” The final acceptance—“The day was incomplete, the poem was incomplete, he was incomplete—and that was the point”—is earned by everything that precedes it. Internal contradiction (wanting to “weave dawns” yet embracing fray) is present but could be pressured a bit more directly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motivation—to devote her remaining life to tending and transforming the orchard in defiance of rigid doctrine—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through tactile choices (refusing the “quiet corner,” kneeling with painful knees to wrap the sapling). Her interiority is embodied and particular (“as if the trees hadn’t leaned into the wire like lovers”), and her values are legible in micro-choices, especially in her debate with Tomas. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (accepting death while still fighting the elders’ ideals), so the arc feels more like steadfastness than deep inner conflict. Tomas’s curiosity-to-commitment mini-arc is believable, though lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s history with her father, her professional ostracization, and her intellectual skepticism create a coherent, specific motivation for pursuing the tower, and the amber fly reactions externalize her interior pull. Her core contradiction—skeptic who’s drawn to a quasi-spiritual “invitation”—is present but could be dramatized with more in-the-moment resistance before she commits. The final choice to go with the figure feels emotionally plausible yet slightly under-struggled given the life she’s abandoning. Still, her hierarchy of values (curiosity, belonging, redefined faith) is legible in each micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman is vivid, with clear vocation, habits, and a quietly obsessive devotion to re-greening the battlefield. His motivation is legible and consistent, and small choices (where he scatters which seeds, how he maps the land) reveal his values. What’s missing at a top-tier level is on-page contradiction or moral friction—he never seems truly torn between competing impulses or costs. As a result, he feels strong but slightly static rather than fully three-dimensional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rook is sharply etched as an old, grief-saturated tracker whose instinct to seek the dead turns toward seeking connection, and his past as a raider’s hound is economically but effectively sketched. His motivation to follow the cylinder’s riddle and the remembered woman is clear and consistent, and his embodied age (creaking joints, gray muzzle) grounds his choices. However, his interior conflict is relatively muted—he feels more fated than torn—so his final surrender reads as beautifully apt but not deeply contested. The piece leans more on mythic inevitability than on messy, contradictory impulses at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation—clinging to “true north,” keeping the family custom alive, needing to turn confusion into exploration—is clear and consistent, and her final leap reads as a credible extension of those traits. Interiority is sensory and specific (the feel of the rail, the sketchbook, her breath on the glass), but her internal conflict stays relatively soft; she never seriously entertains not going. The “blessed pariah” status is evocative yet under-exploited interpersonally, since no other character is on the page. The change from pariah to renewed observer is earned, though the cost of leaving the station is more implied than fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lirien’s motivation (retrieve her master’s legacy and “amend” time/sky) is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and the Keeper’s fear of the unknown reads sharply in his shrine-like chambers and trembling hands. The chivalrous thief code (“she stole only what the world had forgotten to cherish”) personalizes her and informs tactics. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of internal conflict or genuine doubt under pressure—she never seriously wavers, so her final stance costs her relatively little. The relationship beat with the Keeper is strong but could deepen if his resistance or her empathy produced a harder, more conflicted micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s vocation as “the last historian of small gestures” and ex–crisis actor gives her a distinct psyche, and her choices (walking spells, engaging the chessboard, confronting the penumbra) track cleanly with that motivation. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her hands trembled,” the bishop biting into her palm), with a particular way of noticing that feels character-specific. What’s missing at this level is a sharper sense of contradiction or internal cross-pressure under peak stress; she rarely feels genuinely torn, only resolute. The final stance is earned, but the cost to her self-concept could be more explicitly pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—the mercury-glass eyes, the childhood suppression of his gift, the “frequency just below hunger” all feel character-particular rather than generic. His core motivation (answering the call of the stone / facing the cost of his buried talent) is coherent and his final acceptance of the “Keeper of the Unsaid” role is earned by earlier beats. The main limitation is that we see little active resistance or competing impulse at the climax; once the stone appears, he moves toward acceptance with minimal on-page struggle. A touch more friction in the moment of stepping through the door or taking up the pen could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s motivation—atonement for the “fourth move” and past abandonment—is clear, specific, and drives every action from decoding the tapestry to accepting defeat. His inner shift from strategizing for power to choosing to “stay” rather than win is credibly earned by the labyrinth and the girl. Contradictory impulses (pride vs shame, leaving vs remaining) are implied but could surface a bit more explicitly in moment-to-moment micro-choices. Still, the final choice to play on and accept checkmate lands as a genuine, paid-for change.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s characterization as a defiant, word-obsessed dissenter is clear and specific, and her history of punishment grounds her current risk. Her motive to expose the spire’s lie is coherent and drives every choice from climbing sideways to carving while bleeding. What’s missing for an even higher score is on-page contradiction—she rarely hesitates or shows simultaneous competing impulses under peak pressure, so the internal conflict feels relatively streamlined. The final endurance/renunciation (walking away from the shattering without watching) is earned but lightly costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemist’s inner conflict—compulsion to mend versus dread that it “won’t be enough”—is clear, embodied, and carried right into the final choice to let go. Motivation is coherent (a lifelong pattern of repair, now scaled to “the soul of the world”), and their micro-choices under pressure (not counting breaths, narrating to the void, stepping forward) feel specific rather than generic-heroic. The closing transformation from control to surrender is convincingly earned by what precedes it, with real cost in the loss of their workshop and solitary identity. The only minor limit is that their history remains archetypal rather than idiosyncratically personal, keeping this just shy of fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is vivid, with grief, artistic compulsion, and devotion to his mother cohering into a clear throughline from painting the vanished quay to jumping into the cave. His motivation—to fulfill the promise and reconfigure his relationship to loss—is consistent and earns the final leap. However, his internal contradiction (attachment to the quay vs. surrender to the cave) could be staged more in-scene as active struggle rather than mostly implied. The relationship with the mother is powerful but entirely retrospective, limiting the on-page crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is vivid, specific, and motivated: his grief, inherited belief in the cork, and need to be heard all concretely shape his choices. His tension between quiet conviction and deference to Harkin is present, though not deeply torqued into overt internal contradiction under peak pressure. Harkin’s brief softening and pocketing of the cork credibly reconfigure their relationship. The final renunciation—Elias no longer needing the cork—feels motivated and earned with a gentle but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s characterization as the “patchwork navigator” is vivid and specific, with her mapping of loss clearly motivated by the lighthouse disaster and survivor’s guilt. Her emotions are embodied in tactile habits (tracing cracks, handling the censer foot) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—she both distances herself from the living and yet answers calls that might be echoes of herself—though this could be sharpened under peak pressure. Her final choice to provide “the way back” feels earned by the accumulated habits and backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s motives (survival, guilt over his sister, fear of the eye’s “cure”) are coherent and grow under pressure, and his final renunciation—burying the eye—is well earned. The internal contradiction between wanting relief from pain and refusing revelation is present but could be pushed harder in-scene rather than mostly via remembered voices. His embodied responses (the finger twitch, the truffle taste as “a lie, but a gentle one”) are specific and character-particular. Relationships are mostly off-page, so those stakes stay conceptual rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s characterization is specific and textured—his jars of preserved storms, his attention to “gaps,” and his handling of the boutonnière all feel like choices only this man would make. Motivation (to decode the stranger’s gesture) is clear and sustained, and his final stance—accepting the role of carrier/witness—is earned. What’s missing at an elite level is sharper on-page contradiction or visible internal struggle; he understands and accepts his function a bit too smoothly. The piece leans more on atmospheric eccentricity than on a crucible moment that exposes competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply etched: a cautious map dealer, skeptical by habit, pulled into a mythic task by guilt and curiosity. His motivation—answering a long-broken promise—feels earned and consistent with his occupation and temperament. Interiority is specific (chip’s warmth, the ants’ inspection, the remembered stories) rather than abstract. The main gap is that the exact emotional texture of the old promise (what he fears he’ll find or lose) could be embodied a bit more viscerally at the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The queen’s motives are clear and particular—fatigue, disbelief in omens, and a buried childhood bargain all converge into her choice to climb and submit. Interiority is textured (“because of course it was always a trade”), and her laughter at the moment of threat feels character-specific rather than generic. The final transformation into “a constellation given flesh” is earned by the earlier hints of her long complicity with the grotto. I’d like one more sharp beat of active ambivalence right before she gives in to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s drive to “capture presence” and Liora’s counter-stance are clear, and his conceptual shift to becoming the weight of the moment is motivated by their shared history with the shell. Emotional texture is embodied in details like the hum of the shell and the remembered forehead touch, not just labels. However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual (take vs. return) rather than dramatized into hard, costly choices, so the change feels gently earned rather than searing. The relationship is warm and specific, but there’s little real risk or fracture in how they interact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s internal contradictions—jealous of his own past selves yet exhausted by chronicling—are specific and embodied (“feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs”). His choice not to lie about flying and to invite the younger self to burn the scroll feels earned by that history. The younger/older dynamic is efficient but vivid, with status subtly shifting when the older hands over the scroll. The final sense of release (“For the first time in years, his hands didn’t tremble”) pays off his earlier paralysis in a credible way.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn through specific losses and competencies (ex-aromatherapist, now reading people via objects), and the woman’s brief presence still feels particular rather than generic. His motivations—translating objects into emotional meaning, compensating for lost smell—are coherent and drive his choices, especially what he chooses to tell her and how he frames the screw. The closing act of sketching her hands instead of logging a repair nicely crystallizes his values with a quiet, earned cost (accepting that some things can only be witnessed). The only soft note is that his realization about his loss as “a kind of map” edges toward neatness rather than messy contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lian’s motivation—to transform her scars and relationship to storms—is clear, specific, and drives every choice (going to the platform, carving *release*, using the crystallized tip on her oldest scar). Her interiority is textured, with fear, reverence, and stubbornness coexisting rather than a single tidy emotion. The scars, teacher, and grandmother each sharpen a different facet of her psyche rather than serving as generic backstory. The final shift from fearing the “space between storms” to seeking it reads earned rather than declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara and Elias both have clear, consistent motives—regret, damage control, and a stubborn sense of duty—and their history is efficiently sketched through specific choices (her public accusation, his score-selling). The reconciliation choice at the end feels earned, and the cost (the orchard’s loss and years of miscommunication) is legible. What’s missing for a higher score is deeper in-scene access to Mara’s contradictory impulses; she mostly behaves as already-decided rather than visibly wrestling with pride, anger, or fear in the moment. Elias’s emotional arc is strong but similarly streamlined, with relatively little irrationality or mess under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness has a clear, consistent motivation (“to unravel the cosmic illusions”) and his key choices—refusing to answer the temple’s question, tearing the dictionary, then choosing not to reopen it—track cleanly with that drive. However, his interiority remains more archetypal than individuated, so the emotional cost of ending history and his own role as “hinge” is more implied than embodied. There is little sense of contradictory impulses in the moment of tearing the dictionary, which slightly flattens what could be a profound internal conflict. Strong symbolic arc, but not yet a fully lived-in psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives (duty, inherited craft, belief that clocks measure edges, not time) are clear and drive his choices, and his fear/compassion in relation to the ship provides credible inner conflict. The inherited ritual from his father roots him in a specific history and psychology. However, his emotional contradiction at the climax—saving himself/the fabric of time vs. saving the ship’s crew—could be rendered with one more beat of embodied hesitation to fully earn the cost. The “gatekeeper” reframing at the end is strong but a touch stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motivation—transmuting professional pattern-recognition and unresolved grief into a need to reimagine “systems”—is sharp, specific, and consistent, and her final choice to leave the scanner behind feels earned. The intrusion-detection background and the sister’s death both inform how she sees the mushrooms and what she wants from them. Internal conflict is present but relatively low-friction; she moves fairly smoothly from skepticism to participation. Elias is sketched efficiently but serves more as a foil and witness than as an active crucible for her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lila’s motivation is cleanly established (defying the cardiologist to seek answers her own way) and tightly braided with her upbringing in probability and skepticism. Her internal conflict between rationalism and enchanted thinking is dramatized through micro-choices (coming to the library, choosing blue, then refusing to choose at all). The father–daughter dynamic is vivid despite him being off-page, though his presence could exert more concrete, immediate pressure in the climax. Emotional embodiment leans more conceptual than visceral, but remains character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and consistent: the wrong-number operator who chose exile and ritual is vivid and psychologically plausible. His micro-choices—answering every call, spinning the harmonica, choosing “Try again tomorrow” then hanging up first—align with a believable, half-ascetic desire for controlled connection. Internal contradiction (his need for contact vs. his cultivated distance) is present but could be pushed harder under pressure in this particular call. The caller is effectively sketched but remains more emblematic than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s vocation, grief, and sense of duty are specific and consistently embodied, especially in lines like “she had steeped the memory of him for years,” which fuse personality with method. Motivation—to rebuild a covenant through memory and objects—is clear and drives every action in the scene. Internal contradiction (bitterness vs. tenderness, preservation vs. letting go) is present but understated; it could sharpen under a bit more on-page pressure. Still, her final endurance stance (“The covenant was not yet complete, but it was breathing. And for now, that was enough.”) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s competence, skepticism, and transactional worldview are sharply drawn, and her decision to surrender the rock functions as a believable, character-rooted renunciation of leverage. Her motivation—to find Carter and weaponize belief as “aid”—is consistent and legible throughout. Internal contradiction (not believing in magic yet relying on quasi-magical rumor) is present but kept subtle rather than deeply dramatized in-scene, which slightly limits emotional depth. Secondary characters are sketched with economy but still apply relevant pressure (Mira as gatekeeper, Carter as conceptual pivot).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s motivation—to navigate his grief via the stillpoint—is clear, specific, and consistently embedded in his sensory experience of the world. His blindness is not token; it reshapes perception (tasting frequencies, feeling notes) and gives his vocation as a mapmaker emotional bite. The final internal shift (carrying the stillpoint within him) feels earned, though the emotional reversal is slightly smooth and clean for the level of loss implied. Internal contradiction (yearning vs. fear or reluctance) is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivations (to make meaning from mistakes, to “interpret” the universe) are clear and consistent, and his quiet shift from retroactive correction to forward-facing engagement (“Then we plant again”) is well earned. His data-minded stubbornness versus regret forms a subtle, credible internal tension. Emotional embodiment is present but relatively restrained; we see more thought-texture than felt, contradictory impulses under acute pressure. The final stance feels authentic but the cost of relinquishing his old corrective fantasy could be shaded with a touch more visceral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Both Elias and Liora feel particular and textured—his signing as worldview, her whispering charisma that hardens into aggression—but interior conflict stays mostly implied rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses in the peak beat. The motivation to reclaim/remember is clear and consistent, and their actions track well with that. The relationship dynamic is strong, especially in the way they coordinate against the faceless singer, but we never fully see a values clash between them. The final stance (“we remembered them back”) feels earned, if a touch tidy emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s psychology is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: arsonist/savior, vanity/self-erasure, devotion to a promise versus horror at its potential. The realization that “the vandalized self-portrait hadn’t been an act of rage—it had been a map” elegantly reframes his earlier behavior as both self-loathing and strategy. His final choice to burn the ledger is fully motivated by that mix of guilt, love, and fear. A minor limitation is that his relationship to the archivist is sketched rather than deeply dramatized, keeping some of his tenderness at an abstract distance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation—recovering ownership of her mind and rejecting non-consensual “progress”—is clear and consistently rooted in her history as a test subject and quiet saboteur. Interiority is vivid and particular (“vault of auroral sorrow”), and her final act of release feels earned by earlier sabotage and resentment. Internal contradiction is present but light; she’s troubled yet fairly resolved in her opposition to the doctors, so the arc is more crystallization than deep moral struggle. A slightly sharper sense of competing impulses at the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s characterization is specific and textured: his job, his skepticism, his habit of reading walks, and his relationship with the coin all feed directly into his choices. His core drive—quiet persistence and listening versus brute force—is dramatized through how he accepts and answers the woman’s challenge. Internal contradiction (wanting to leave the labyrinth yet being bound to listen to it) is present but could be sharpened under peak pressure. The woman is intriguing but lightly sketched; she functions more as catalytic force than fully realized foil.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guardian and the boy are both sharply etched in a small space, with clear motives (her nonverbal tending of “fractured souls,” his shame around the father) that align with their actions. Interiority leans a bit on authorial summary (“She knew the shape of his shame”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the boy, so his shift feels slightly smoothed rather than jagged. The relationship with the father is off-page but still legible through specific details (stolen nails, star-naming, the note). The final change—boy lighter, father softening—is credible and earned, if somewhat gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—protect the library through strategy rather than noise—and his actions (notes to students, prep in the grotto, accepting a non-final “win”) align with that. Interiority is particular enough (“planting forests of second thoughts,” the pawn in his pocket) to feel like a distinct person rather than a stock martyr. However, his internal conflict is muted; we don’t see him genuinely doubt, fear, or miscalculate in a way that complicates his choices. The endurance at the end is credible but carries relatively low felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s history (dock work, piracy, theft of the scrimshaw) and his embodied relationship to the sea give him specificity, and his quiet acceptance of the call is consistent with a man already half-detached from land. Motivation—to answer something he has always belonged to—is clear and threads through his micro-choices (touching the scrimshaw, walking past the dockworkers, “unfolding” rather than jumping). However, internal conflict is relatively soft; he feels little real hesitation or competing loyalty to the island or its people, which slightly flattens the emotional stakes of his transformation. The final sense that he has “only remembered” who he is is earned, but the cost to his old life is underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena is sharply realized: the performer turned numb caregiver whose “blank face” hides a volatile interior, and the choice to scream then teach whittling flows convincingly from that history. Her habits (stillness, whittling, carrying the bouquet) and her refusal to cry all feel like embodied leftovers from the Mandate. The internal contradiction—clinging to preserved grief while craving real expression—is dramatized rather than explained. Harkin, though sketched briefly, has a clear, distinct presence and his muted responses apply gentle but real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s motivation—to return to the atrium for “the tremor of certainty” and ultimately to move beyond it—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her poet-identity, and her micro-choices (touching each pillar, letting the hum “rewrite her”) all flow from that. The internal conflict between reverence for the sacred and the urge to transgress it is present but often expressed as thesis (“respect was just another kind of fear”) rather than dramatized through more resistant hesitation or cost. Her transformation into “the thing that reshaped” boundaries is convincing and earned by prior beats, but its emotional price remains mostly conceptual. The absence of on-page interpersonal friction limits how fully we see her flaws under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is vivid and particular—colorblind painter, plant-communicator, wary of silence—so his gentleness and perceptual strangeness feel lived-in rather than quirky. His core motivation (seeking aliveness in the aftermath of the phoenix and in imperfections) cleanly supports his choices around the cracked vase, the concertina, and Liora. Internal conflict (fear of silence vs desire for connection) is present but underplayed, so his final openness costs him less explicitly on the page than it might. Liora and the old woman function well but stay comparatively thin, essentially as foils and catalysts rather than fully pressured agents.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation—seeking the “texture of connection” and honoring her grandfather—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her choices (using the lens, persisting when the device “is not supposed to do that”). Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in how she relates sound, connection, and pilgrimage. However, her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see a sharp, contradictory pull that forces a painful trade-off. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving the bell, accepting an unfinished pilgrimage) is earned but carries a relatively gentle, low-friction cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s grief, craft-obsession, and mentorship bond are specific and embodied (“her grief coiled tight as the wire she twisted”), and her choices—switching from lilies to cranes, tattooing herself, teaching others—track cleanly from those traits. The internal shift from hoarding grief to sharing it is credible and prepared by the mentor’s maxims. There’s a touch of tidiness in how smoothly she pivots once she finds the copper flower, but it still feels earned rather than schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched—"onyx-ink cartomancer" with indigo-stained fingers and a methodological, unsentimental curiosity—and his choices (buzzing the client up, reading her data like cards, handing over the tape) are coherent and motivated. The former quant is sketched efficiently, with one strong complicating note (her brother as the guru) that adds moral texture. Emotional conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied, which flattens potential impact around the brother reveal. The final stance—turning his tools on "the culture itself"—feels earned but carries limited felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian’s motivation and internal tension are clear: a lifelong drive toward forbidden knowledge countered by disciplined fear of repeating past catastrophes. Her method (“to know is to resist repetition”) and choice to unmake rather than decode the pagoda credibly shape her actions. Interiority is textured but she remains a bit archetypal—“the saffron-veil historian” more than a fully individuated psyche. The final peace feels slightly too tidy for the scale of the inner risk, softening the sense of ongoing contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s perceptual signature (“dusk noticer”) and half-emptiness are specific and motivate her final choice to trade her shadow. The hope-entity and poet backstory give her a credible ethical stake rather than a generic noble sacrifice. However, her internal conflict at the decisive moment is underplayed; she yields her shadow with very little dramatized ambivalence or fear, which slightly softens the cost. The curator functions more as a witness than an active pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and layered: guilt over the con, a compulsion to mend, and fear that his softness is a flaw all pull against each other in scene. His choices—to give away real medicine, to leave tincture for the apothecary, to write restitution letters, to go help strangers—consistently reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. Interiority is concrete and specific (“the fear that kindness was weakness”), not abstract diagnosis. The final stance—seeking balance rather than forgiveness—feels earned and credibly unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally consistent: her professional obsession with “chasing closure” meshes cleanly with her new plant-telepathy and her scar-focused perception. The internal conflict between decoding wounds and simply bearing them is active on the page and culminates in a credible renunciation at the end (“Some stories weren’t meant to be read. / They were meant to be carried.”). Emotional states are embodied through scars, breath, and sensory overlap rather than labels. The only thing keeping this just shy of top-tier is that her pre-surgery life and any relational pressure (e.g., with her mother) remain largely conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s desire (to locate the unsent goodbye letters / “unused love”) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile, specific choices—handling the film, feeding the projector, deciding to turn it off. Her interiority is particular and embodied (celluloid warming, breath fogging glass) rather than abstract labels. The final renunciation—accepting “Goodbye” and letting the dark have its say—feels earned by the accumulated evidence that he did love her but chose silence. The only softness is that her contradictory impulses (to hoard vs. release) could be made a touch sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s characterization as a “moonstruck dreamer” with stardust in her bones is vivid and coherent, and her choices (stepping under the arch, engaging the well, accepting the role of key) follow intelligible motives. However, her internal conflict is minimal: she moves from call to acceptance with near-total compliance, so we never see a substantial tug-of-war between safety and surrender to this vast task. The moment she realizes the place is “a prison for ideas too wild for the world” could carry more ambivalence or fear; instead, she slides almost instantly into fulfillment. The closing acceptance (“She had become the path”) is earned but lacks a clearly felt cost beyond a gentle melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hollow’s core drive—dutiful emptiness shading into protective purpose—is clear and consistent, and his final shift from “Hollow” to a man with “a cargo worth carrying” is earned. However, his interior life is sketched more archetypally than idiosyncratically; we infer his loneliness and quiet hope rather than feeling contradictory impulses grind against each other in scene. The choice to safeguard the spark is moving but not deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The philosopher’s interiority is vivid and sensorially grounded, and his desire to “unravel the hum” gives him a coherent through-line. The final shift—accepting becoming the hum and no longer needing to wander—feels motivated by the preceding visionary sequence. However, he reads more as an archetypal mystic than a fully individuated person with contradictions and blind spots; there’s little friction or genuine struggle under pressure. The cost of his change (what he gives up by dissolving his previous stance) could be more sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s inner conflict between guiding others across and finally choosing to stay is clear, specific, and embodied in small choices (pressing the punch into her own palm, letting it fall into the shallows). Her history as a ferry guide and the recurring star stamp efficiently reveal her values and guilt. The final renunciation—joining the vigil and leaving the punch—is well motivated by prior beats. The one limitation is that emotional complexity edges toward tidy insight rather than lingering contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—a bellhop defined by service, numbness, and a history of complicity—and his key choices (breaking the seal, handing over the bolt, deciding to “tell them the truth this time”) are motivated and coherent. His internal conflict between preserving “safety” and allowing dangerous sound back in is present but mostly conceptual rather than fully embodied in moment-to-moment hesitation. The pianist is more emblematic than fully human, though his burned body and stitched mouth give him weight. The final endurance choice (“He stayed”) feels earned, but could carry even more cost if Elias’s fear or investment in the existing order were dramatized more concretely earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veythas is vivid and particular, with strong externalized character (stone-bodied, long-lived, quietly authoritative) and clear motive tied to Lirien and the throne’s lie. However, his inner conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized—three hundred years of ignoring warnings vs. the sudden choice to act now is gestured at but not emotionally worked through on the page. The sacrifice of Lirien’s name lands, but we don’t fully inhabit his ambivalence or grief in that moment. The pretender himself is more a function than a character, which keeps the relational crucible narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation—to prove these “lost” paths exist and to follow them—is clear, specific, and drives both her private rituals and her final choice. Her interiority is vivid in images (the torn atlas, the grandmother’s rhythm) rather than abstract labels, and her final refusal to “report this” feels earned. Internal contradiction (duty vs obsession, fear vs pull) is present but could be dramatized more explicitly under peak pressure. Voss functions as a credible but lightly sketched counterweight rather than a fully realized crucible relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena is sharply realized through concrete quirks (bare feet, opera glasses, impatience) and a clear hunger for meaning that drives every choice. Her “awkward confidence” shows on the page in her refusal to obey the lull and her willingness to touch the stones first. Internal conflict is quieter (hope vs fear of nonsense) but present and credible. The scout is thin but functional, adding just enough relational pressure at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is vivid, with clear motives (“Tradition isn’t a cage… it’s a ladder”) and a specific sensibility as gardener-listener to plants. Her decisive choice to unseal the amber is well-motivated by long-held beliefs and accumulated pressure. However, she feels almost entirely assured and right; there’s little embodied contradiction or fear in the moment of transgression, which flattens the emotional cost. Relationships (with grandson, Council) are sketched effectively but could cut deeper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied, with clear contradictory impulses (wanting to hate the tourists vs. not correcting the child, wanting to freeze vs. daring to imagine a future). Her actions—clutching and then releasing the photograph, substituting the leaf—align cleanly with her motives and history. The therapist frame edges toward light therapy-speak but is grounded in tactile choices (palms into thighs, breath counts) that keep the arc earned rather than abstract. The final endurance/renunciation (photo vs. leaf) forecloses a path with a palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied—her fear, artistic frustration, and pull toward “necessary dark” are all legible, and her final choice to become canvas rather than painter feels earned. Motivations (to see/descend into the dark, to reframe brokenness) stay consistent and intensify with the lighthouse’s constriction. Internal contradiction (clinging vs unmaking, fear vs surrender) is present, if more thematic than situational. The cost—self-dissolution of identity as “artist”—is implied clearly enough to register.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation (guilt over past failure, obsessive hunt, shift from killing to understanding) is clear and coherent, and we get a distinct emotional texture in “serene anger.” His key choice at the end—to follow rather than destroy—feels earned by the preceding realization about time fracturing. However, internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized in-scene; we rarely see him actively torn between impulses in the moment. A touch more embodied struggle around the decision to step through would elevate this to truly top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives—duty to the Vaults versus fidelity to truth—are clear and consistent, and her final choice to trigger the leak feels earned by prior doubts (“entering false compliance reports while hiding the discrepancies”). Her embodied reactions (warm letter, shaking hands, fogging breath) generally feel specific rather than generic. The “I’ve just *remembered*” line reads a touch schematic, compressing a complex stance into a slogan rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motivations—staying with the roses despite the tower’s collapse and her father’s insistence she leave—are clear, embodied, and particular. Her contradiction (daughter of a bounty hunter who refuses violence, using a knife only to inscribe words) is used well and culminates in an earned stance of endurance. The emotional texture (“pain grounded her,” listening to plants) feels lived-in rather than generic. The arc is a nuanced deepening rather than a large turn, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fisher’s grief, discipline, and long apprenticeship to silence feel specific and embodied, and his key choices (digging where the soil refuses to hum, commanding silence, then letting the final echo go) are convincingly motivated by that history. His cool-headedness under cosmic and personal pressure is consistent and character-particular rather than generic stoicism. The tension between his yearning for his daughter and his hard-won knowledge of which echoes to drown gives the ending real cost. A slightly clearer on-page flicker of temptation at the final “child’s hand” moment could deepen the sense of contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lydia’s internal life is specific and motivated—her mix of filial loyalty, professional duty, and inherited regret feels coherent and drives her choices. The fire, the cufflinks, and the pen nib all reveal her through what she clings to and what she questions. Her final decision to publish is emotionally credible, though the moment skews a bit clean and assured; a touch more mess or fear would deepen the felt cost. Secondary characters apply light but functional pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, from marking grieving mothers to trying to erase “the cry at 3:17 a.m.” and finally choosing to stay with the baby. Interiority is specific and embodied through objects (amber, tattoo, firmware) rather than generic labels. The contradiction between wanting silence and needing to witness is dramatized rather than told. A slightly deeper sense of her life beyond this event might push the character into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior is sharply etched—his refusal to scrub, his attentive listening, and his comfort with “whimsy” all feel specific and grounded. His micro-choices (keeping the flake, beginning the mandala, plunging his hand into the void, then quietly seeding subversion in the square) align coherently with a core value system. What’s slightly missing for top-tier is a more embodied sense of conflicting impulses or visible cost—he rarely feels genuinely torn or afraid despite the magnitude of what he’s doing. The result is rich characterization with only modest internal contradiction or on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn through tactile actions and morally charged choices; “gentle radical” and “the Mender” are actually dramatized in how he works and faces the commander. His grief-as-weapon motivation is clear and consistent, and the moment where he invites death rather than abandon his work feels earned. The commander’s rapid softening is credible because of the shared grief and his opening line already hinting at unease, but his inner conflict is only lightly sketched. The emotional cost is present but could deepen with one more embodied hesitation or contradiction in each man.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lydia is sharply etched: the stage-addicted ghost whose “itch in the bones” and synesthetic perception feel specific and embodied, and her quiet acceptance of being “never the star” gives her real pathos. Elias is thinner but adequate for the length; his despair is legible through posture and micro-reactions more than interiority. Motivation is clear and consistent for both—she’s compelled to intervene, he’s poised to die—though his internal contradiction (wanting both oblivion and the futures she shows) could be more textured on the page. The final renunciation of suicide and Lydia’s resigned return to the wings feel earned and aligned with prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s blend of tenderness and skepticism is sharply drawn and governs every major choice, from pressing the sliver to her temple to deciding to paint a door instead of immediately stepping through. Her motivation to understand Mira’s path, not avenge or “save” her, feels specific and earned. The internal conflict—follow Mira’s dissolution vs. remain an embodied artist—is present but could be pushed a bit harder at the moment of the door’s appearance. Mira’s characterization is necessarily oblique but still distinct through remembered behavior and the single painting she leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lior’s vocation and rebellion motive are clearly established and consistently embodied in how they read the environment, especially via the heat-map reactions. Interiority is specific (“factually mystical,” the breath hitch at the fossil’s memory) and character-particular rather than generic. However, their internal conflict is muted: they move from outlaw curiosity to fulfillment with little felt resistance or cost, so the final “claiming” of the role reads slightly easy. A touch more ambivalence or competing impulse under pressure would deepen their arc.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, tools, and history with the buttons give him a strong, particular interior life, and his quiet, dutiful temperament is consistent with his choices. His motivation to protect the hourglass and decode the prophecy is clear and drives all his actions. What’s missing, at this caliber, is sharper on-page contradiction—his fear of the hourglass breaking doesn’t clash strongly enough in-scene with the risk he takes or a desire to refuse the burden. The final realization (“The hourglass doesn’t break. We do.”) reads earned but emotionally could dig one layer deeper into personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s characterization is vivid and specific: the burned spy whose prudence and daring are both dramatized (her reluctance to open the pillbox versus ultimately choosing to). Her interior conflict is clear and embodied—burn scars, shallow breath, fixation on the pillbox—rather than abstract labels. The relationship with the man in the greatcoat is efficiently sketched as a fraught former alliance that applies direct pressure. The only minor shortfall is that her final decision lands a touch cleanly for someone so traumatized; an extra note of unresolved fear or self-deception could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.3)
    Characters are cleanly sketched and distinct—the coachman’s disciplined patience, the merchant’s impatience, and the girl’s eerie receptivity all read clearly through behavior. Motivation is coherent (the coachman obeying the cryptic promise, the merchant wanting to move, the girl aligning with something larger), but internal conflict is underdeveloped: the girl’s decision to leave her mother lands a bit too frictionless for the implied cost. We don’t get embodied panic, doubt, or even self-justification around that break, which mutes its emotional impact. Still, the quiet endurance of the coachman at the end feels earned and character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The potter is distinct, consistent, and particular—his vocation, gentleness, and draw to the oasis cohere into a believable sensibility. His motivation to return, to embed the glass, and ultimately to leave the bowl behind flows cleanly from the traits we see. However, his interior conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses under pressure; we rarely feel him torn in the moment. The piece leans on lyric observation more than embodied, micro-decisive struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives—coaxing growth after war, needing light in dark corners—are specific and embodied in her choices, from using the gauge to accepting Elias’s second tooth. Her contradictions (pragmatic blood-offering vs. superstitious whispering to seeds; isolation vs. wanting connection) are present without being over-explained. The relationship with Elias functions as a crucible where status and intimacy subtly shift, culminating in her allowing hope. The emotional turn to “believe in the shape of an open door” feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s guilt, weariness, and gradual shift from seeking judgment to accepting “independence” are convincing and particular, especially around the translator’s hour and his reaction to the mirrored book. His micro-choices—touching the tome, naming the translator’s hour, raising the sundial as shield, finally stepping through the doors—track credibly with that inner conflict. The Hesperornis is more symbolic than fully characterized, but its physical actions (attacking its reflection, offering the feather) give it clear agency. The final stance—stopping the pursuit of forgiveness—feels earned by prior beats rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s vocation, habits (keeping drafts in a chest), and hesitation over giving up the spiral make her feel particular and internally consistent, and her final shift to writing for herself is motivated by prior beats. The tension between her role as keeper of others’ secrets and her own withheld letter is dramatized rather than told. The emotional conflict is gentle rather than searing, but it’s credible and layered. Secondary characters (artist, monk) are lightly sketched but serve as effective foils without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is sharply sketched as a disgraced but still driven astronomer whose competence and stubbornness feel grounded in specific details (knowing every dial notch, sneaking into the old station). Her motivation—to push back against a manipulative cosmic force and the institution that sidelined her—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (caution vs. hope) is present but handled in shorthand rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices. The final stance—she keeps the line open, "just fixing the radio"—is earned, though the emotional cost remains somewhat understated.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motivation (the key, the father’s compass, the need to fix a crooked city) is clear and consistent, and his claustrophobia gives him a credible internal obstacle. His embodied fear in the shaft (“lungs tightened… breath turned traitor”) feels specific rather than generic. The final understanding about remaking doors rather than opening them is earned by what he’s just done, not tacked on. The only ceiling here is that his inner conflict at the moment of the key/compass test is resolved very quickly, with limited on-page hesitation or contradictory pull.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s characterization is rich and specific: a face-blind investigator who “doesn’t need eyes to see the dead,” methodical yet carrying buried guilt. His choices—answering the ribbon’s summons, using the lance, choosing witness over futile vengeance—track cleanly to those traits. The internal conflict between professional detachment and submerged empathy is present but mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in-scene. The final shift (“his methodical heart a little less still” and walking toward the coughing child) feels earned, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—clearing Orin’s name—drives every major choice, from staying outside to pressing the nail to the glass to burning the journal, and his interiority is specific and embodied. His mix of intellectual obsession and quiet loneliness feels particular, not generic. The final renunciation (burning the journal) is credibly earned from his earlier “knowing” plus the glimpse of the ship. Liora is lightly but effectively sketched as a counterpressure rather than a full arc.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, particular interiority (bridge-song fiddler, accustomed to uncanny hitchhikers) and his curiosity plus desire for “amnesty” credibly motivate his final choice. Embodied perception (glass humming, threads of road) stands in for explicit emotion but still reveals him. Internal contradiction—hesitation versus hunger for escape—is present but underplayed, so the cost of leaving his old life remains abstract. The final transformation into “the song” feels earned but could land harder with a sharper sense of what he sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply rendered through specific history, habits, and the inherited worldview of a robber-turned-philosopher, and his motive for returning (“to understand why the train, like his own life, had circled back”) is clean and consistent. His inner conflict—between inherited compulsion to take and a new urge to relinquish—is dramatized in small choices like pocketing only the lira and then walking away. The father is offstage yet vivid, with teachings that both guide and trouble Elias. The final renunciation (leaving the train and the “secret” behind) feels earned and costs him an old identity without straining credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and consistent—his ink-stained, ledger-bound solitude clearly drives his need to decode the inscriptions and understand his sister. The switch from hoarding dreams to joining a chorus of shared burdens feels earned by the accumulated evidence (telegram, sister, astronomer, temple as loom). Internal conflict between his habitual solitary witnessing and the emerging invitation to share is tangible, though it could surface a shade earlier under explicit tension. The emotional pivot lands credibly, with the cost of relinquishing his old identity implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Eldrin’s guarded, damage-driven nature is clear and consistent, from his self-description as a “finder” to the lie, “I didn’t come for you.” His motivation to extract the lake’s truth about his brother is articulate and escalates credibly into an emotional cost. The internal contradiction—wanting truth but habitually freezing or burying it—emerges, especially in the final choice to “let the silence win.” A deeper, more embodied sense of his immediate fear or revulsion in the key confrontation could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s motivation—to finally heed her scars and unearth the eclipsed covenant—is clear and consistent, and her root-bound, scarred visionary identity feels particular. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped; once the journey begins, she rarely doubts or wavers in ways that generate real micro-contradictions. The relationship with future-Liora is intriguing but too brief to fully pressure her values. The final shift into “keeper” is earned conceptually but could register more as a hard-won choice with cost rather than a near-inevitable culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s guilt, reckless trading, and determination to “mend me” are clear and consistent, and her final stance—keeping her scars as hers—feels earned. The moment when the roots pull at “the name of the child she’d failed to save” is an excellent crystallization of motive. However, internal contradiction under peak pressure is relatively muted; she doesn’t seriously waver or resist, which slightly flattens complexity. Veyra’s role as a relational counterweight works but stays light-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liam is sharply rendered: the ex-roadie who now appraises “detritus of dead dreams” feels specific, with clear flaws and contradictions (professional at valuing objects, adrift about his own worth). His emotional responses are embodied in small actions (handling the cloth, cataloging facts to avoid feeling), and his final choice to claim the scrap reads as an earned, costly reorientation rather than a neat epiphany. The widow anecdote and his band memories deepen, rather than summarize, his conflict. The only slight limitation is that his shift edges toward tidiness in the closing paragraphs, though it remains credible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation and interiority are rich and specific—his obsession with “transitions” is rooted in grief and professional temperament, and the realization that the spirit was a hypothesis rather than a ghost feels earned. His methodical, bridge-building mind is consistently dramatized through action (deciphering, climbing, planting) rather than labels. The main limitation is that his internal conflict under peak pressure is relatively smooth; there’s little on-page hesitation or contradiction at the key moment of touching the flower. The relationship with his wife is tender and particular, but in this wordcount it functions more as a memory/reward than as an active crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s role, temperament, and quiet devotion to paradox are clear and specific, and the woman’s desire “to stir my tea with the taste of almost” is sharply characterized in one line. His decade of work and his particular choice of crucible show values through action more than label. Internal conflict is present but understated—he shifts from “smelting into something useful” to recognizing the creel’s different kind of value—so the cost of that stance isn’t deeply dramatized. The refusal to write her into the ledger is a strong character beat, but its emotional price remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inspector’s motives are clear and consistent—curiosity, skepticism about the “weapon,” eventual commitment to releasing the radiance—but her inner contradiction is fairly gentle and tidy. The moment of hesitation before wearing the pearl is effective but quickly resolves, with little sense of real risk or push–pull between obedience and transgression. Bodily and emotional textures (“fingers trembled,” “too busy learning how to shine”) are vivid but lean toward emblematic rather than idiosyncratically personal. The closing decision to defy the higher-ups and become a carrier feels earned, if thematically neat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply drawn: the ex-river chronicler, guilt-ridden and stubborn, whose choice to go off-map and finally walk to the third bridge feels both inevitable and costly. His interiority is concrete and particular (“the fog had started to feel like a second skin”), and his flaws (avoidance, self-importance, refusal to name his own guilt) are allowed to stand. The final choice to turn right reads as a credible, modest but real shift rather than a tidy cure. The only minor limitation is that the sister relationship, while thematically potent, remains entirely off-page, so its emotional specificity can’t deepen further at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dreamer’s motivation (to access and preserve the unsaid) is clear, and her arc from archivist/observer to vulnerable speaker is well earned by the time she writes the third letter. Interiority is concrete and particular—her reactions to the watch, the shelves, and the collapsing library feel embodied rather than generic. The final renunciation of temporal manipulation in favor of honest expression (“The watch, now silent, she left on the windowsill…”) credibly forecloses a path with cost. Internal contradiction—needing unspoken safety while pursuing dangerous knowledge—could be made just a shade sharper on the page, but it’s present.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives—financial freedom, professional obligation, and a deepening allegiance to plants and unowned art—are clear and in tension throughout. Her interiority is specific (“she’d pricked her finger on a thorn and suddenly understood the scream of a dying fern”) and consistently embodied. The choice to smash the violin is fully foreshadowed by the coffee visions and plant voices, reading as an earned culmination rather than a flip. The only limitation is that we glimpse only one central contradiction (obligation vs defiance), not a more layered web of flaws or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is sharply etched—a beautician-mortician whose attentiveness to thresholds ties cleanly to her vocation and choices here. Her motivation (carry a final “spark” for the dead) is credible and drives each beat. Internal contradiction is present but muted; she moves toward acceptance with relatively little visible struggle or competing impulse on the page. The change at the end (from fearing oblivion to re-seeing it as radiance) reads earned but emotionally soft rather than hard-won.

    Maren’s psychology is rich and coherent: the tension between having “forgiven” and still carrying a carved-out hollow drives every choice from offering the heirloom to silently gifting the fruit. Her embodied history as a caretaker (rough hands, bandaging at the end) grounds the interiority and avoids abstraction. The only slight limitation is that the arsonist remains more symbol than person, so the relationship crucible is powerful but one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured: his fear of “edges” and history as a conscience-for-hire create a plausible, idiosyncratic psychology. His actions—listening to the shard, unhooking the cloak, choosing to let the lens stay dusty, accepting the woman’s help—track cleanly with that history. The contradiction between his craving for certainty and his dawning embrace of doubt is dramatized rather than told. The only minor limitation is that once he commits to change, resistance softens quickly, so the turn feels slightly smooth for such a deep-seated habit.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s characterization is specific and textured: a backward-aging researcher who seeks erasure yet remains tethered to teaching, with clear, embodied interiority (“his spine straight as a sycamore,” “years peel away…like petals from a dying flower”). His contradiction—hiding his condition vs. preparing for the student’s return—reads organically. The grandfather’s maxim and the prior student ground his motives without overexplaining. The final choice to step into the dark feels like an earned continuation rather than a fresh turn, which slightly mutes the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skimmer’s motivation (to master the ancestral stillness and protect/guide pulses) is clear and consistently rooted in lineage and practice, and his key choice—to act as an anchor and lure the Maw—is credible. Interiority is evocative and particular (“movement was a confession. Stillness was survival”), but his internal conflict is relatively soft; he rarely doubts or wavers under pressure. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to stay, to wait for the next wandering pulse) feels thematically apt but emotionally muted, with limited sense of personal cost beyond abstraction. Strong, but less than fully piercing on the psychological axis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlin’s motivation is clear and specific—his attachment to “lingering luminance” and refusal to equate mastery with worth drive every choice from climbing in exile to rejecting the deans’ praise. His interiority is filtered through concrete obsessions (the candle, fissures of light) rather than labels, and his final renunciation (leaving the keystone, keeping the unruly candle) feels earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he’s ashamed enough to accept penance, yet stubborn enough to trust his “defect.” The gardener is sketched but effective as a pressure agent and thematic foil rather than a fully rounded character.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsession with “the color of sound” is clear, consistent, and organically motivates every major choice—entering the wreck, following the library, using the key, releasing the lantern. His interiority is conveyed more through sensibility and perception than explicit thought, which fits the lyric mode but leaves his fear, doubt, and competing impulses a bit underexplored. The late accusation, “You’ve been hiding behind the truth,” retrofits a blind spot that could have been seeded more concretely earlier. The final shift—choosing to “make” color rather than find it—reads earned but could carry more visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and grounded in her pattern-obsession, and her choice to let the frequency pull her apart reads as the natural culmination of that trait. The “quietly enthusiastic about patterns” line, plus the others’ view of her as mad, gives her a distinct flaw/strength that drives the decisive act. Emotional texture is embodied through gestures (palm on glass, trembling fingers) rather than labels. The one slight limitation is that her fear or hesitation at the brink of dissolution is underplayed, keeping the internal conflict from feeling fully jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper is sharply etched: a being who tore out his own heart to carry others’ grief and now compulsively shapes nameless fears. His motivation to name and externalize dread is clear and consistent, and details like tucking the atlas into his ribs individualize him. However, his internal conflict—he “already” regrets what he’s doing—never quite sharpens into an on-page struggle or alternative, so the final choice feels solemn rather than truly contested. The endurance/renunciation at the end (he keeps walking) is credible but could carry more felt cost if his ambivalence surfaced more actively earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply etched: a modestly skilled, methodical mage whose stubborn, almost obsessive hope feels specific and credible. His lukewarm ability constrains his tactics, and the contrast between how villagers see him and how he sees himself adds texture. Internal conflict (naive faith vs awareness of imbalance worsening) is present but could be pushed harder under peak pressure. The closing endurance—working until his fingers bleed—reads as an earned extension of his earlier devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—living as a warden of the reservoir that drowned his family, then choosing to reframe that role—is clear, specific, and drives every action. His internal conflict between warning others about the reservoir’s “hunger” and wanting to “feed it” with his own haunted memories is dramatized rather than explained. Micro-choices (keeping the bottle but not drinking, scraping the emulsion from the photo, deciding to burn the photographs instead of himself) reveal a coherent, flawed, deeply particular psychology. The final shift from warden to son and storyteller feels earned by the preceding images and costs him his private hoard of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemist’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: a rigor-trained mind driven by an illicit hunger for wonder, prepared to sacrifice status and identity. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (“the last shred of the girl who had once pressed flowers into books”), and the final choice to step through the door feels earned by the build-up of her worldview and longing. The sentimental/rational split operates in-scene rather than as mere label. If anything, the priests and her broader social bonds remain abstract, slightly softening the felt relational cost of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—carrying the “watcher’s burden” and preserving unseen trust—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices from opening the buckle to refusing the radio. Interiority is rich and embodied (“her breath hitched, not from fear but from the burden of knowing”) with a distinct worldview around patterns, silence, and absence. Internal conflict exists but is fairly muted (she largely moves from readiness to execution without serious wavering), which keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional. Still, for this length, the emotional throughline is convincing and her final endurance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s split self, tangible in the jars and in his “numb half-life,” gives him a clear, specific motivation, and his decision to merge is grounded in that history. However, his internal conflict at the decisive moment is under-dramatized—he moves from idea to execution very quickly, with little on-page hesitation or fear beyond a couple of lines of pain. Veyra is vivid but somewhat underutilized as a crucible; she challenges and supports him, yet their relationship doesn’t significantly change by the end. The cost of becoming whole (risk of death, possible failure, or moral qualms about defying the court) is more implied than emotionally wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply drawn—a principled, slightly obsessive curator of cognitive “stretch,” whose choices (turning the seed into a puzzle, moving the answer outdoors, accepting business loss) track cleanly with his philosophy. Lina feels distinct through small, well-chosen details (the email line, how she listens, the mud, the spectrometer) despite limited space. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized; Elias transitions from game-runner to caretaker of a community without much on-page friction or doubt. The relationship between Elias and Lina has promise and warmth but stops short of being a true crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s grief, ritualized caretaking, and compulsion to “tend to the unspoken” are specific and consistent, and the shift from hidden conductor to participant is well-earned by the on-page pattern of behavior. His “mournfully eager” quality gives him texture rather than reading as a label, and the final renunciation of the tunnel feels like a real cost. Internal contradiction (needing distance vs needing connection) is present, if handled somewhat gently rather than under real duress. The family is sketched more than dramatized but functions adequately as the pressure and reward.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyssa’s interiority is specific and textured: the keeper/prisoner tension, her bone-deep tiredness, and her ambivalence about the books’ “homesickness” all feel earned and particular. Her final decision to hand over the pendant is clearly motivated by that long habituation to uncertainty and by her dawning empathy for the books. Emotional states are embodied (“teeth ached,” “weight of words lifting from her bones”) rather than labeled. The one slight limitation is that her feral edge and moral compromise could be pushed a bit further under true duress.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is sharply etched—obsessive, wounded, and driven—with motives grounded in exile, humiliation, and a need to prove that “creative destruction” is real. His actions (feeding the crozier memories, choosing the forbidden incantation) align cleanly with that psychology. Internal contradiction (yearning for grace vs. attraction to ruin) is present but could surface more dynamically in the peak beat. The transformation at the end feels earned, though the emotional cost of that shift is gestured at more than fully dwelt in.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, method, and connection to her mentor give her a distinctive, coherent inner life, and her key choices (using the fragment, surrendering to the note, then jumping) are motivated by that worldview. However, she moves through the piece with almost no on-page ambivalence or contradiction, so the internal conflict feels muted. The transition from fear of failure to literally redefining gravity reads more as smooth revelation than pressured choice, which softens the sense of cost. Strongly etched but more emblematic mystic than fully fraught individual.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is vivid, competent, and particular—her banter, tactile work with ropes, and matter-of-fact handling of ghosts all feel grounded. Her motivation to keep the ferry aligned and protect its passengers is clear and consistent. What’s missing for a higher band is real internal contradiction: she never visibly doubts, flinches, or pays an emotional price, so her final stance is more confirmed than changed.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is specific and memorable—a “fever dream architect” who uses his own memories as material—and his grief-tinged composure feels consistent. His core motive (to build and then let the piece be dismantled, to prove memories aren’t owned) is clear, and his final “Again?” reads as a credible endurance choice. However, his interior conflict is muted; there’s little on-page friction between cost and desire, so the choice carries more concept than emotional struggle. The woman in gray applies some pressure but remains more emblematic than individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s curiosity and vocation are clearly motivating, and her decision to reinterpret the chain and teach a new form of navigation tracks well with what we see of her. Internal contradiction is mild—there’s little felt fear or doubt—so her shift reads more as fulfillment than as a hard-won change with visible cost. Kael functions mainly as a foil and witness rather than a true pressure source, though his skepticism briefly sharpens her stance. The emotional life is present and particular, but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a man whose professional habit of listening collides with a forbidden ability, and his curiosity/pseudo-martyr complex (“He wasn’t a hero. He was just a man who listened.”) coheres cleanly. His emotional reactions are embodied and specific (shallow breath when the dead call, knees hitting stone). The reveal that the child is his works conceptually but feels slightly underprepared emotionally—his history of forgetting or loss is sketched rather than dramatized. The closing stance shift (accepting duty to the dead as well as living) is credible and earned, but could pay a clearer personal cost beyond awe and disquiet.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s fear of confined spaces versus his compulsion to seek out the “unremembered” is clear and motivating, and his micro-choices (pressing into the seam, deciding to carry something back) track cleanly with that drive. Interiority is textured—his claustrophobia is felt in the body, not just labeled. The main limitation is that his inner contradiction is described more than dramatized under peak pressure; the moment of decision at the seam could carry sharper, more conflicted embodiment. Still, his final stance—choosing to return, not as a thief but as witness—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s motivation—fear of bureaucratic erasure and obsession with her own heartbeat—is clear, specific, and threads cleanly through the scene. Her attachment to the porcelain shard and the way she responds to the ink-voice feel psychologically grounded rather than schematic. The final shift from fear-driven counting to shared cadence with the “ghost” is earned, though the internal conflict could sharpen further by forcing one sharper, riskier on-page choice. Overall, she reads textured and particular, but the price of her shift is more gently implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s motivation—inheritance, professional obsession, and ancestral hunger—is clear and drives her refusal to stop (“translate it all, even the untranslatable”). However, interior conflict is more implied than dramatized; we don’t really feel a live tug-of-war between awe, fear, and ambition in her body when the canyon “wakes.” Her final mistake is thematically apt but slightly under-motivated emotionally on the page. Strong specificity (copper in veins, translator lineage) gives her individuality despite the cool distance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—grief over his sister calcified into bitterness—is clear and consistently drives his bad choices (ignoring the herbalist, taking the arrowhead, answering the phone, choosing to be “rewritten”). Interiority is vivid but more declared than dramatized in key moments; his final choice feels thematically apt but a bit under-contested on the page. The herbalist, though only lightly sketched, reads as a distinct, grounded counterpoint. The sense of cost in Elias’s metamorphosis is present but could be more emotionally particular to him rather than mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The violinist’s desire and resolve are clear, and her choices (using the locust shell, stepping down from the sky-bridge) credibly drive the transformation. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or doubt; the arc is more an unveiling of power than a struggle of impulses. Emotional embodiment leans lyrical rather than deeply particularized to her history or flaws. The final inner shift (“for the thing inside her own chest…”) works but feels more asserted than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias and Lira both feel specific and alive, with clear motives grounded in their roles—he delivers what others abandon; she “fosters” stray letters. His “respectfully rebellious” streak is dramatized via his calculated risk with the drones and the scar on his wrist. Interiority is mostly handled through image and action rather than abstract labels, and his realization about waiting letters credibly shifts his sense of purpose. The piece could brush slightly deeper into his internal contradiction (duty vs. futility) under peak pressure, but what’s here is coherent and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior’s characterization as someone who chooses silence and then reframes it as offering is clear and specific, and his craftsman’s attention grounds his interiority. His final shift—from treating silence as retreat to treating it as a door he builds—is earned by prior beats. However, his internal contradiction under pressure remains implied rather than fully dramatized, and the woman’s character is more functionally archetypal than individually pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn: his ritualistic habits, the scarf, and his relationship to his mother’s math-poetry give him a distinct interior life and coherent motive. His core want—reawakening memories rather than hoarding them—is dramatized via concrete micro-choices (performing the reading, sacrificing the scarf, unlocking the restricted section). Internal contradiction is subtle but present: his archivist instinct to preserve vs his eventual willingness to dissolve the scarf into the library. The emotional cost of letting the scarf go could be shaded just a touch more viscerally to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    The librarian’s motivation—part archivist’s duty, part obsessive longing—is clear and consistent, and her final choice between order and wildness feels earned. Interiority is specific (ink-stained fingers, breath catching at the pulsing photograph) rather than abstract, and her micro-choices around the hungry dream are coherent. There is credible ambivalence in her hesitation when the dream asks to go back, though the internal conflict could be shaded with one more sharp, self-revealing contradiction. Overall she reads as an individual with a distinct sensibility, not a stock “mystical librarian.”

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The locksmith is sharply etched through rule, profession, and childhood wound; her decision to violate “Never open what you cannot close” feels grounded in that history. Internal conflict is present (caution vs compulsion, skill vs humility), though it resolves with relative ease and little visible cost. The man is functional rather than dimensional, serving pressure more than character. The final conceptual shift (“letting the locked thing decide”) is earned but emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply drawn as an obsessive, tactile folklorist whose decades-long fixation and creeping amnesia clearly motivate his choices. His interior conflict between wanting the past and suspecting the allure of erasure is implied (“what if the gaps… weren’t losses, but spaces held open”) rather than fully dramatized in on-page dilemmas. Embodied reactions (the prickling quiet, trembling hands, breath hitching) feel specific and grounded. The relationship with the memory eater-as-former-friend hints at deeper history but arrives very late, so it doesn’t have time to function as a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elspeth and Kael are sharply etched in a very small space: her controlled, slightly ruthless care and his anxious diligence feel specific and lived. Motivation is clear (she’s training him to return, not escape), and their dynamic under pressure is credible. Internal contradiction is present but mostly implied rather than fully dramatized—Elspeth’s mix of pride and dread at his success could be pushed a hair deeper. Still, the relationship reads as the true crucible and shifts meaningfully by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply etched: the “insatiable craving to shape the unseen” plus his refusal to correct villagers’ perceptions grounds his later risks, and his choice to leave at the end feels like a coherent extension of that hunger and his sense of debt. The girl, though briefly present, is vivid and particular (the apple dimming at her touch, the ribs through her dress) and functions as more than a mere symbol. Internal conflict is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in active dilemma, which keeps this just shy of extraordinary. Still, micro-choices under pressure—giving away the heirloom seed, painting her wrists, then ultimately leaving—are consistently rooted in his character.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias feels specific and internally conflicted: a craftsman whose instinct is to mend, confronted with the knowledge that "the net was a lie." His silence-accumulation and inherited craft read as lived traits, not labels, and his final refusal to "fix" is motivated by what we’ve seen. The internal contradiction—duty to contain vs. recognition that containment is wrong—operates clearly in the knot decision. I could imagine a hair deeper embodiment of fear or reluctance in the climax, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara is sharply etched through her vocation and habits—the brass lenses, frame-by-frame analysis, and her refusal to step through yet all feel specific and earned. Motivation (to understand the tear/chapel through careful listening) is clear and consistent. Internal conflict is more implied (Guild training vs her intuition) than dramatized, so her final stance carries modest but not searing cost. I was most persuaded by “First, she would listen,” which crystallizes her character without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and consistent—her analytic temperament, history with “last transmissions,” and grief over her sister all inform how she reads the Athene and the globe. Her decision to lie in the report and to “let go” of needing to know is well-earned by prior setup and carries a visible cost in self-betrayal. The internal conflict between professional compulsion to understand and the dawning recognition that some answers are destructive is present, though it could be surfaced in one or two more sharply embodied moments under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The balladeer is sharply etched: his vocation, curse, and inherited language of pressing/encoding all align into a coherent psychology. His central conflict—whether to let the ghost out into himself or deny it—is well motivated by his lifelong role as translator of silence. The memory of his grandmother meaningfully complicates the final choice. A minor limitation is that his fear/desire to be inhabited by the ghost is more implied than fully dramatized in moment-to-moment interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s characterization is vivid and coherent: her “warmly inquisitive” nature, history as a servant, and quiet tenacity are embodied through how she handles the diary, the goggles, and her reframing of the spire. Motivation (seeking meaning/joy in a seemingly prison-like place) is clear and builds to the final decision to keep climbing. The inner change from seeing the spire as prison to lens is well prepared by the diary and the observational data about joy. Internal contradiction is mild, though—there’s little on-page struggle between despair and curiosity, which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is specific and coherent: a poetic, grief-driven meteorologist whose fixation on “empty spaces” and clouds as emotion feels both idiosyncratic and rooted in loss. His choice to board the gondola and not resist the snapped string aligns with that motivation and culminates in a genuine internal shift from anxious cataloger to surrendered “thread in the spool.” What’s missing at elite level is more active contradiction—he rarely fights his own desire to dissolve, so internal conflict stays muted. The emotional change is credible and earned, but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The artist’s motivation—compulsively trying to hold what can’t be kept—is clear and coherently tied to her history of failed portraits and guild work. Interiority is specific and embodied (“pillow damp with sap,” fingers twitching with muscle memory) rather than generic. Her final renunciation (letting the coin fall, choosing not to carve the empty sheet) is earned by prior beats and carries a visible cost. There’s a touch of abstraction around her emotional response to near-death and loss of the library that could be shaded with a bit more contradictory feeling under that pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is clearly and consistently drawn—rule-bending, pattern-obsessed, eager for discovery—and her curiosity plausibly drives each choice. Her embodied responses (fogging the glass, kneeling at the board, pulse jumping) give her some specificity. However, internal contradiction and cost are light: she gets validation and a logbook with minimal emotional or relational price. Veyra’s shift from irritation to respect is believable but sketched rather than pressured into complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation (restore the broken “clock” of the hall to reclaim her sister) is clear, specific, and integrated with her craft identity. Interiority is embodied and character-particular—her “fingers ached for the rhythm of repair” elegantly fuses skill and longing. The years of study and grief give weight to her actions, but internal conflict could sharpen further; she rarely hesitates or doubts once the repair begins, so contradictory impulses under pressure stay somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s drive (seeking respite, then choosing to build it) and Kael’s steadfast altruism are clearly motivated and consistent, and his repeated “You’re early” creates a lived relationship. However, Liora’s internal conflict is underplayed; we don’t feel much resistance or doubt once she commits, so her final “We stay” carries less visible cost than it could. The found-family ensemble is sketched efficiently but remains schematic rather than individuated. Still, the closing sense of chosen rootedness feels earned by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s vocation, bodily wear (“calloused…sickly amber”), and remembered lullaby create a specific, convincing psyche under pressure. His core contradiction—clinging to delay vs. choosing a final, self-erasing act—feels earned by the long history with the clock. The moment he understands the puppet head is a key and still hesitates gives the climax emotional weight. The only small limit is that his inner life leans archetypal rather than idiosyncratically personal beyond the mother/lullaby thread.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s core motives—duty to the orchard, fear of the curse, secret defiance through guiding travelers—are clear and consistent, with a credible history in the vanished caretaker and the blueprint. Her reluctance and harshness versus her covert compassion make her feel specific rather than archetypal. However, internal conflict is mostly summarized (“who had spent a lifetime refusing pleas”) instead of dramatized in present-time micro-choices, slightly muting the emotional bite of her decision to help the girl. Embodied emotion is present but light; we see her actions more than we feel her bodily turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply drawn through his professional lens, tactile memories of his sister, and his obsession with building bridges as atonement. His grief and guilt are embodied in specific images (the scar he stitched, the brittle chrysalis) and his final renunciation of atonement feels earned by the prior interior work. The girl works well as an external pressure/echo without stealing focus, but her own characterization is minimal. The internal conflict is mostly between analysis and surrender, not fully multi-directional, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora is sharply etched through vocation and worldview—“keeper of clean slates, dealer in absences”—and her calm, attentive way of working makes her feel particular rather than generic. Her key choices (accepting the trade, how she uses the obsidian needle, choosing not to open the moonlight) are consistent and quietly revealing. Internal contradiction is muted, though: she operates more as a confident officiant of a philosophy than as someone under real emotional pressure, which limits depth. The patron is functional but thin, providing a clear want without much personality beyond hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is specific, embodied, and motivated: the blend of craft detail (“sandpapering the edges off” memories) and his sensory interiority (tastes, textures) makes him feel real. His core drive—relief from overwhelming memories versus duty to tend them—is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is present but relatively subdued; we see strain more than active inner argument in the moment. The final stance (accepting ongoing burden) feels earned, though the cost could be shaded a bit more acutely on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is vivid, specific, and consistently motivated as someone who turns abstract community care into concrete action (seed catalogs, engraved weight, phrase cards). Elias has clear history and resistance in a small space, and their dynamic feels lived-in. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or visible cost for Liora—she never really wavers, so the emotional arc feels a bit too smooth for the stakes the story gestures toward.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena’s characterization is vivid and specific—her “helix of equations,” stolen nanites, and the engineer/archeologist split create a credible, idiosyncratic mind. Her motivation (to probe entangled memories and abandoned dreams) is clear and consistent with her choices. Internal contradiction (precision vs self-destructive experimentation; engineer vs mystic) is present but could be pushed harder at peak moments. The final shift into “cartographer of the entangled dark” feels earned but its emotional cost is more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lysara’s grief-driven motivation and “prism-mind” perception are specific and consistent, and her choices (entering the grotto, reaching for the jar, burning the manuscript) clearly arise from that mix of longing and dangerous curiosity. Internal conflict is present—she hasn’t come for power, yet she’s tempted by what the seeds can do—but it never quite sharpens into a live, on-page dilemma where two values collide in a single moment. Embodied emotion (trembling hands, mist swallowing her scream) feels grounded rather than stock. The final stance—accepting the manuscript’s blankness and assuming the work herself—reads as an earned shift rather than an epiphany declared from nowhere.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to give grief a voice in a silent world—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete choices (listening, strumming, ultimately leaving the insulator). His interiority is particular and embodied via his sensitivity to vibration rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is light; we don’t see a sharp conflict between competing impulses, only a steady, calm dedication. The final renunciation (leaving the insulator) feels earned but emotionally under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives and fears are clear and specific—the exiled tutor who questioned “why the board’s edges were always drawn in blood” gives him a credible wound and worldview. His internal conflict between fear of engaging and desire to understand/translate the covenant plays through the scene, especially in “Not of losing. Of playing at all, when the stakes are invisible.” The relationship with the girl is simple but effective, letting her curiosity press on his reluctance. His final choice to play and then hand her the worry stone reads as an earned, modest shift with emotional cost paid in vulnerability rather than spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply etched as a man who “collected silences,” with concrete habits (the device, his workshop solitude) and a credible pacifist aversion to conflict. His interior conflict—valuing empathy and quiet vs. the realization that this stance has limits—builds cleanly toward his choice to step out and open the repair stand. The final shift from collector/observer to participant feels earned and costs him his carefully protected isolation. A touch more specificity about past failures of his pacifism could deepen the sense of risk even further.

    Liora is sharply drawn—ambitious, sensory-obsessed, and precise—and her motive for theft (serenity within sway) is clear and consistent. Her interiority is particular (smelling grief, deceit, rot), and her choices (stealing, planting, facing the Elders, building the bridge) align with that character. Internal contradiction (hunger for forbidden wisdom vs respect for tradition/family) is present but could be pushed harder under direct pressure. The Elders are fairly thin as individuals, but they function adequately as a social force shaping her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veyra’s motivation (mentor’s legacy / “source of resilience”) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a pilot is well-embodied in her choices and perceptions. However, she faces little genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; she wants something, then receives and accepts it without much struggle. The moss spreading on her skin hints at a potential cost or fear that never quite materializes as conflict. Her final shift into “answering” the planet is earned conceptually but emotionally a bit too smooth for the level of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Veyra’s guilt-driven insistence on data over intuition is clear, specific, and consistently motivates her choices, from meticulous measuring to finally running instead of documenting. The internal contradiction (engineer’s training vs. half-belief that the city is “learning”) is present, if a bit underplayed in the peak beats. Her shift at the end—starting a new log oriented around “Listen”—is credibly earned by prior causality and marked with real cost (shattered instrument, lost patch, shaken worldview). Secondary relationships exist only as ghosts (the dead colleague, families), but that’s appropriate to the focused scope.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—to defy the elders’ command and “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and consistently expressed through her theft of the sheet and her choice of how to ring the chimes. Her synesthetic perception gives her interiority a distinctive texture and some embodied emotion (“listened with her skin”), but much of her conflict is framed conceptually rather than as in-the-moment, contradictory impulses. The elders function mostly as an abstract pressure, so we don’t see her flinch or hesitate under direct relational cost. Her final stance feels earned but relatively untroubled, with minimal sense of what she personally sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is clearly drawn as a weary, competent guardian whose identity is bound to duty and failure, and his shift from sealing to deliberately widening the breach feels motivated. His interiority is specific (“harvest insights from his failure,” fear of the hush rather than the storm) rather than generic. The internal conflict—duty to keep out vs. curiosity/acceptance that some doors must open—could be dramatized more sharply in moment-to-moment choices instead of mostly in reflective narration. The child functions more as a thematic catalyst than a fully realized character, but that suits this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s core drive and flaw—collecting emotions without letting them change him—are clear and pay off in the final shift (“You were never the printer. You were the page.”). His borrowed widow-voice, blacksmith anger, and child’s hope give him specificity beyond archetype. Internal conflict is present but largely conceptual rather than dramatized through hard, resisted choices, which slightly softens the felt cost of change. Relationships are mostly evoked via memories rather than on-page interaction, limiting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courier’s desire (find mentor / understand the hum) is clear and consistent, and his arc from trembling to confident seed-planter feels earned. Interiority is concrete in places (“hoping one would hold the key to his mentor’s absence”), and his final choice to walk back toward the villages instead of merging fully with the ridgeway marks a real shift. However, his internal conflict remains relatively soft—there’s limited sense of competing impulses under pressure beyond generalized hesitation. The woman functions more as an archetypal initiator than a fully pressured character, so relational tension is evocative but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and coherent—his attentiveness, skepticism about ghosts, and belief in echoes all feed his method and his final renunciation. The motivation to test the car and prism is clear and escalates credibly into dread and then clarity. His final act of destroying the prism reads as an earned, costly choice that forecloses his lifelong pursuit. Slightly more explicit contradiction (need for proof vs fear of what he’ll learn) in the middle stretch could deepen the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is very clear and consistent—the longing to reach the lost lover drives every choice—but we get more mythic framing than granular, contradictory interiority in the moment of sacrifice. The detail that she has “never stopped searching for the seam between here and there” effectively grounds her persistence. However, her acceptance of the cost reads as pre-decided rather than fought through on the page, which blunts the sense of live internal conflict. The lover is more emblematic than individuated, functioning as a receiver rather than a fully characterized counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The smith’s meekness paired with a “slow-burning” will is clear and consistently motivating, and his choice to descend and “just listen” to the planet feels earned. Interiority is more archetypal than idiosyncratic, but his values and temperament are legible in each decision. The final endurance—continuing to work and listen without seeking glory—reads as an Earned Stasis with modest but real cost (the silk spent, responsibility assumed). I’d like one moment of sharper internal contradiction under pressure to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motives (answering the “pull,” seeking the withheld truth) are clear and track cleanly into her final choice to step through the seam, and her sensory-mapping interiority feels particular rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely hesitates or missteps—so we see competence more than struggle. The man at the end is effective as an emotional anchor but remains lightly sketched, with little pressure exerted on her values. The closing transformation (“She was the map now”) is thematically strong but comes with relatively little dramatized emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and consistent: the ritual with the sea glass, the burning of the first letters, and the eventual decision to stay all track cleanly with a taciturn, wounded man gradually yielding to contact. Motivation is clear—guarded self-preservation giving way to a desire for connection and meaning in his role as keeper. His change at the end (choosing the tower and the correspondence over the skiff and silence) feels earned and carries cost. The only slight limitation is that his internal conflict is more implied than fully dramatized in a few key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s duty, history with the village, and relationship to the storm are vivid and specific, and her micro-choices around the wick and her refusal (“You can’t have it”) are motivated. However, internal contradiction is only lightly sketched—her “laughter as weapon” concept is strong but never forces a truly fraught choice this night. Her endurance at the end feels more like reaffirmation of a role than a sharpened renunciation with visible cost. This keeps the characterization strong but not yet at a truly elite, publish-ready depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dye master’s motivation—to understand the alien pull of the donor heart and the nature of story-magnetism—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his choices (tracking the wing, leaving the tea house, painting for the villagers). Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the heart sometimes ached when he passed the market square”), and his refusal of overt power in favor of facilitating others’ stories feels credibly rooted in temperament. Internal conflict is present but subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping this just shy of the very top tier. The final acceptance of his role (“a map of all the stories he would never tell—but would help others find”) is well earned by prior beats and carries a felt cost in self-effacement.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is sharply etched as a gentle, competent custodian whose instinct is to listen to broken things, and his choice to “pass the sorrow along” feels both specific and earned. His emotional experience is embodied (hands rough from mortar, tears from “pressure” rather than sentiment), not tagged with labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than it might be for peak scores—he tends more toward holy-functionary than conflicted person—but the piece still lands a credible shift in how he bears sorrow. The lack of another on-page character limits relational pressure but suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s vocation, weariness, and sense of duty are clearly rendered, and her actions all align with the drive to revive the realm. However, her fear of the method is mentioned rather than deeply dramatized, and we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or morally fraught choices under pressure. Interiority is evocative but mostly in service of atmosphere rather than a complex inner argument. The final “release” feels earned but not bought at a sharp personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s characterization is rich and coherent: the “curse” of her empathy, the reclusive routine, and the specific guilt over the thesis all feed credibly into her choices to ascend, to face Voss, and finally to lock the door. Her internal contradiction—need for solitude vs. burden of unread questions—is dramatized rather than stated. The emotional turn at the end (from hiding to engaged custodianship) is well-earned, though the resolution comes a touch swiftly into clarity. Voss is necessarily schematic as a reflection rather than a full second character, but this fits the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s sensibility and motives are sharply drawn—she notices skewed normality and responds with quiet, experimental care, making her choices feel organic. Emotional embodiment is carried more by perception than explicit feeling, but it works for her temperament. Internal contradiction is relatively light (she withholds from “the others” but the cost of secrecy is only lightly implied), which keeps the arc from feeling fully crucible-tested. The prince is more symbolic than individuated, though that suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is cleanly motivated (extraction vs preservation) and his shift from measuring to accepting an invitation is coherent and earned. His emotional life is mostly implied through reactions to the woman’s image and voice, with nice touches like trembling hands and misting breath, though internal contradiction is only lightly sketched. The final choice to step onto the bridge is believable but not deeply contested on the page. Overall he reads distinct and specific, but with room for more textured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motivation (settling her father’s debt and capturing the “sound of trust breaking”) is clear and consistent, and her competence under pressure feels lived-in rather than generic. The inherited watch fob and routes nicely externalize her burden. However, her internal conflict is underplayed—she never seriously seems at risk of balking or misstepping, so contradictory impulses are more implied than dramatized. Veyne is vivid in a few strokes but remains largely a functionary of the plot rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s motivation (a skeptic driven to empirically measure others’ “carried weather”) is clear and propels her to the bluffs and into the experiment with the ring. Her transformation into “the weather” is logically seeded, but the emotional cost and internal contradiction are muted—she adjusts astonishingly quickly to a profound identity rupture. Interiority is vivid in sensory terms (tastes, textures) but less so in conflicted feeling; there’s little real resistance or fear. The arc reads as a graceful unveiling rather than a pressured, value-testing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and specific—grief-stricken, burdened by duty, and obsessed with finally unlocking his own art through the lock his father last touched. His mnemonic gift and history with both parents create a coherent internal landscape that informs each choice. Internal conflict (duty vs. calling, fear vs. desire for color) is present, though the peak sequence tilts toward a clean breakthrough more than a messy tangle of impulses. The final renunciation of “half-living” feels earned by prior setup and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s compulsion toward truth, physical aversion to lying, and life as a “gilded-leaf calligrapher” give him a specific, coherent psychology. His choice to go to the Archive and then to write honestly instead of beautifying is credibly motivated and forecloses an old mode of being. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“skin paled like parchment,” “air itself had turned to brine”). The main limitation is that his conflict remains largely intrapsychic, with no live relationship on the page to sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s vocation, muteness, and relationship to sound are specific and embodied (ice to cheek, breath held with the bluff), and her motives—preserving wonder via sound—are consistently dramatized. However, she faces little contradictory impulse or real dilemma; she is almost entirely aligned with her purpose from first line to last. The final endurance/renunciation (quietly continuing her work despite the valley’s indifference) is credible but low-cost. A touch more visible internal friction under pressure would lift this into truly standout characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias-7’s inner conflict between preservation and necessary destruction is specific and well-motivated, especially in the line “he was made to protect, and protection required destruction.” The fears, the woman in the desert, and his programmed role all converge credibly on the match-lighting choice. His emotional experience is convincingly embodied for an android—static, hitching diaphragm, magnetic pull—without lapsing into generic “sad robot” tropes. The progression to leaving the dome feels earned and carries real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is clearly etched as a pragmatic, story-driven curator whose calm decisiveness under odd pressure feels consistent, and her attention to objects ("her fingers already dusty") grounds her interiority. However, her internal conflict is muted: she moves from curiosity to quiet acceptance without much resistance or contradiction, so the final stance shift (toward communal healing through listening) costs her relatively little on the page. Secondary characters (Mrs. Delgado, Old Man Chen) are vivid but function mostly as exposition and chorus rather than true crucibles. The endurance at the end—accepting mystery instead of prying—is credible but not deeply earned by prior moral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motives (to decode, then to choose what to do with the scientist’s secrets) are clear and expressed through embodied action—most powerfully in the dice-triggered dance and the choice to flood the lab. Her interiority is specific and character-particular, filtered through codes, rhythm, and water rather than generic feeling labels. The major weakness is the relative lack of visible internal struggle at the climactic choice; she arrives at the decision to destroy the work with very little on-page hesitation. The closing “only kind of strength worth having” pushes toward tidy resolution rather than allowing more moral ambiguity to sit in her.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lantern lighter’s grief-driven motive is clear and specific, and his routines (coffee divination, flower compass, stone-carrying) render him distinct rather than generic. His endurance at the end—renouncing further probing for now while accepting that “gravity… was always hungry”—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction under peak pressure: we see obsession, but not much simultaneous impulse to stop or protect himself in the chamber beat. The wife remains more concept than relationship, which trims some potential emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The summoner’s core desire (to hush the prophecy) is clear and consistent, and her actions in the ritual are motivated and coherent. However, her interiority is largely archetypal—“hollow-eyed,” solitary, driven—without much character-specific contradiction or history beyond the quest. The emotional cost of partial failure is hinted (solitude “like a second skin”) but not deeply particularized. This keeps her compelling as a figure, but not quite as a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—to understand his brownstone’s whispers—drives every major choice, from seeking Veyra to signing the blood contract, and his quiet stubbornness feels specific. Veyra is sketched with economical but vivid detail; his insistence on “agreeing to the lies” sets a credible, eerie ethic. Internal conflict at the contract (“What’s the lie?”) could go one shade deeper in embodied doubt before he signs. The closing beat, where Elias steps into Veyra’s role, is well-earned but could sting more if his ambivalence toward perpetuating the pattern were more explicit on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s motive—to resist the sanctioned erasure of memory—is specific, consistent, and sharpened by personal losses. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (“the shell pulsed…like a dying man’s grip”), and her final choice to stay and face the patrol feels earned. Internal contradiction (skeptic who nonetheless trusts the shell) is present but could be dramatized more in-scene rather than mainly asserted. The patrol are thin sketches, but they function adequately as external pressure rather than characters.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The forger’s guilt, endurance, and turn toward forgiveness are sharply etched, and the Emperor’s weariness and capacity for change give the central relationship genuine weight. Motivations are clear and consistent, and the forger’s choice to stay, use the thorn, and then teach the Emperor all feel earned. However, much of the forger’s inner conflict has already been resolved before the scene begins, so we see relatively little live struggle on the page. The reconciliation between forger and Emperor is moving but comes slightly smoothly for such a fraught history.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Veyra’s motivation—to understand her echo and confront the traitor—is clear and sustained, and her final renunciation of the shell reads as an earned, costly choice. Interiority is vivid in perception but shows relatively little contradiction until the ending, where her acceptance of silence lands well. Kaelis functions more as an archetypal foil than a deeply individuated character, but his worldview is coherent and pressures Veyra’s. A bit more on-page struggle in her decision to sing (and to give up the power afterward) would deepen the sense of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s characterization is vivid and specific—her patience, refusal to lie, and relationship to wreckage all emerge through action and image rather than labels. The widow is sketched efficiently but with enough particularity (palms on the altar, voice “wrong, too thick with something like hope”) to feel real. Internal contradiction exists—Lena both “let go” and clings to “the parts worth saving”—but is more implied than dramatized in on-page struggle. A slightly deeper, more contested moment around her own locket would push this closer to elite.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael and Liora are cleanly sketched through action and dialogue—the teacher who mends what others ignore, the skeptical apprentice whose worldview is gently disrupted. Their motives (Kael’s commitment to hidden work, Liora’s curiosity and doubt) are concrete and consistent, and the mentoring dynamic provides a subtle crucible. The main limitation is the relative softness of internal contradiction; Liora shifts from skepticism to participation smoothly, with little on-page resistance or cost. Still, the final micro-choice—her taking up the whisk—feels earned by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is sharply sketched—skeptical, pattern-driven, almost professionally allergic to grand conspiracies—and his worldview clearly motivates his presence in the orchard. His interiority is concrete ("He didn’t believe in curses. But he believed in patterns.") and his pattern-hunting frames how he interprets the stillpoint. The main weakness is that his climactic decision to "turn the key" comes very quickly; we don’t feel much active resistance or cost in him before he chooses to cooperate. The transformation into someone who embraces the “garden” feels conceptually right but emotionally rushed for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as an obsessive, isolated seer whose choices clearly stem from his history of listening to forbidden transmissions. His interior metaphors—hinge, needle, hand—are specific and character-particular, not generic. The internal conflict between being carved by the dawn versus wielding it is present but could be more viscerally dramatized at the final decision. The cost of his transformation (to himself or others) is more implied than emotionally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve and translate forgotten sounds—feels specific, embodied, and consistent, and his shift from hoarder to sharer is well earned. The scene with the girl crystallizes his internal contradiction (clinging to the past vs. giving it away) in action rather than exposition. Emotional reactions are grounded in sensory detail (the trembling hands, the burning eyes). The girl is lightly sketched but distinct enough to serve as a credible relational catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The engineer’s mix of competence, fatalism, and blue-collar pragmatism (“She called it *work*”) makes her feel specific and grounded. Motivation is clear and escalates cleanly from maintenance to self-sacrifice, with a sharp embodiment of fear and awe as the sound tears through her. The logic/emotion split is dramatized in-scene rather than summarized, and her acceptance of becoming “less human, more ethereal” reads as an earned renunciation. The only ceiling is that her backstory with the monks is sketched rather than fully dramatized, slightly limiting the depth of her contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lior’s motivation is clear, coherent, and particular: he is committed to a slow, patient revolution in defiance of his community’s appetite for spectacle, and his choice to step onto the ice and not look back grows credibly from that. The conflict with his sister and the “fire and fury” faction is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of live interpersonal pressure. His interiority is distinct and embodied (“letting the cold seep into his bones like a second pulse”) but he moves through the climax with relatively little felt turmoil or contradictory impulse on the page. The cost—leaving the hearths and choosing solitude—is legible, but its emotional bite could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched as competent, methodical, and quietly obsessive, with his father’s maxim and his refusal to answer Lina nicely crystallizing his priorities under pressure. His “watchfully calm” demeanor feels earned through behavior, not labels, and the way he follows whispers while insisting he doesn’t believe in ghosts shows a subtle inner split. The final stance—choosing to go to the archives and oppose institutional erasure—is well motivated by his history and present observations. What’s missing for a higher score is a more explicit, in-scene conflict between his role as a system agent and his drive to expose that same system.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt, vocation, and history with Harkin give him a clear, specific motivational engine, and the turn from passive confessor to active maker of reparative acts feels earned. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“sorry was too small a word for some sins”), not diagnostic. The choice to go out into the storm and then to keep writing letters embodies a credible internal conflict between avoidance and responsibility. The only slight limitation is that his darker reluctance or potential self-justifications are hinted at more than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pip’s motivation—to hack the rules of flight despite lethal cost—is vivid and consistent, embodied in details like the arrow tip in her wing and her compulsive re-leaping. Her curiosity and stubbornness feel particular rather than generic, and her micro-choices (freeing the arrow, strapping it to her chest, leaping again at the end) track cleanly. What’s lighter is explicit internal contradiction; fear, doubt, and desire are mostly implied through metaphor rather than dramatized as active push-pull in her mind. The closing endurance—accepting perpetual risk and damage as the price of her project—reads earned, if more iconic than psychologically deep.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s motivation and professional role are sharply defined, and her choice to accept “termination” to restore the erased is credibly seeded. Interiority is specific in places (the patch warm in her palm, the numbers haunting her environment), but her inner conflict—fear vs obsession vs grief—could be layered more explicitly under pressure. The final surrender reads a bit martyr-clean, with limited on-page struggle or contradiction in that moment. Elias is effectively present as an absence and hologram, but the relationship’s emotional texture remains somewhat schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply sketched as a “shadow-laced” peacekeeper whose habitual de-escalation contrasts with the risky intervention he’s contemplating. His motivation—to stop being only an observer—is clearly rooted in his nature and history. Internal conflict (calm, intuitive reader of others vs. someone who must finally act) is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized in a live crucible with another character. The arc from observer to actor feels earned, if a touch under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s interiority is specific and textured—“trawling for meaning in the wreckage of other people’s lives because her own had begun to feel like a room she’d outgrown” is exemplary of how motive and worldview fuse. The euthanasia-tourist motive, the heirloom, and her reckless calm on the ice cohere into a credible, contradictorily numb yet risk-taking person. Her change (canceling the clinic, reorienting toward “slow unraveling”) is earned by the ice-walk and parasol revelation, though it happens slightly quickly given the extremity of the initial choice. Emotional contradictions (death-seeking yet careful with others, “the quiet one” who laughs unexpectedly) are present but could be pushed one notch further under peak pressure for true 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lior’s interiority is specific and embodied—soil, vines, wine, and memory all feel filtered through his sensibility. His core contradiction (loyalty to the vineyard vs. unresolved attachment to Mira) plays out credibly in small choices: examining the letter, drawing on it, and then tucking it over his heart. The final stance—accepting both her departure and his rootedness—reads as earned renunciation with emotional cost. Slightly more in-the-moment friction or irrationality under the letter’s shock could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lysan is clearly motivated by preserving the old, quieter wisdom against the prophet’s disruptive fervor, and her line-walker training grounds that motive in concrete competence. Her micro-choices—refusing to turn toward the voice, continuing the consecration despite awareness she can’t hold it forever—show a coherent hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is present but subtle; she rarely wavers or reveals sharply contradictory impulses, which keeps the arc more steady than deeply fraught. The endurance at the end reads as an Earned Stasis, but the felt personal cost could be shaded more distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—to reframe inherited pain through her art—is clear, consistent, and concretely expressed in choices like waiting for the light and selecting specific photos. Her interiority feels particular (e.g., “for the first time in weeks, her chest didn’t ache”), though she remains almost entirely competent and self-possessed, with little on-page contradiction or true inner struggle. The relationship to the town and bakery son is sketched effectively in minimal strokes, but remains largely one-directional (she observes, they respond). The change at the end—her lighter case, calm heart—feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s obsession, isolation, and quiet desperation are clearly drawn, and his choice to finally leave the library and join the others is motivated and credible. The embodied details (trembling hands, shallow breath, rickety ladder) do good work, though his inner conflict stays relatively gentle—there’s little sense of what he’s truly risking beyond habitual solitude. The woman is lightly but effectively sketched as a mirror/foil, adding pressure without stealing focus. The final realization (“the pattern wasn’t in the growing. It was in the listening.”) feels earned but leans more philosophical than psychologically specific.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is specific and memorable—“junkyard prophet,” haunted by a tape of his own childhood voice—and his compulsion to find patterns vs his eventual renunciation reads as an earned internal shift. The precognitive forgetfulness adds texture and one key moment (“for the first time in years, Elias remembered something before it happened”) but could constrain his choices more. Emotional states are mostly embodied through tactile engagement with the garden, tape, and fog rather than labeled. A touch more in-scene contradiction under peak pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched as “a sage of broken things,” and his core contradiction—fixing versus letting go—is present from the first paragraphs and resolved in his final choice to walk away. His interiority is vivid and particular (“felt the hum of something trying to break free—not the structure, but the idea of it”). The cost of his change is more conceptual than viscerally felt; we don’t see a concrete loss beyond leaving a life behind. Still, his final renunciation of reflexive repair reads earned and character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is specific and embodied—the vinyl shard biting her lip, the tight ribs, the practiced read of when “hope shifted from a flame to a scent.” Her core tension between “decisively kind” and feeling that kindness can be a betrayal is dramatized in the way she plays despite Mrs. Calloway’s gallows humor, then chooses to stay through the goodbye. The relationship with Mrs. Calloway is sharply drawn in few strokes, with status and vulnerability shifting as the music works. The final renunciation of the shard feels earned by all that precedes it, with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and stubbornness are clear and consistent, and her final choice to step through the door after the automaton’s warning is well-motivated by what we’ve seen. However, she rarely experiences genuine internal conflict—her recklessness never really contends with fear or doubt on the page—so her arc feels more like a confirmation of her nature than a pressured evolution. The “quietly deliberate” aspect is nicely embodied in how she handles tools and questions rather than declared in abstraction. The relationship with the automaton has intriguing status dynamics but remains underdeveloped as a crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Liora is sharply etched—a forgiving skeptic, a bone-setter, someone who keeps the charred needle because she "yearned to understand"—and her choices feel consistent with that nature. Her emotional life is largely embodied through sensory detail and specific memories, which keeps her from reading as stock. However, internal contradiction under pressure is underplayed: she slides from discovery to bargaining with remarkable steadiness, with little fear or doubt complicating her competence. The closing shift ("Now she knew how to set the world") feels earned but comparatively low-cost, more confident than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora is sharply drawn through her practices, memories, and relationship to light; her grief and ethos feel specific rather than generic. Her motivation—to keep and transmit a different kind of light—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to pass the “pearl of stillness” role to the girl reads earned. Internal contradiction (attachment to stillness vs. latent longing and loss, e.g., around Elias) is present but understated rather than dramatized in scene. The child is more emblematic than individually characterized, but functions adequately at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motivation (escaping the viral noise to transform her wounds) is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her small but pointed choices—inviting Javier into the ritual, giving up the pendant—feel earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she claims she’s not hiding while clearly needing refuge, and “Brave is a word for people who don’t flinch” reveals a live tension in her self-concept. Javier’s “quietly proactive” care is specific and behaviorally grounded, giving the relationship real texture. The only limiter is that we’re held at a slightly aestheticized distance from Lena’s rawest emotional turbulence, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and specific—his relationship to the shell, his mother, and his own artistic control is sharply drawn—and his shift from fighting the current to surrendering to it is credibly motivated by the mounting apparitions and the faceless figure’s accusation. The competing impulses (control vs. listening/surrender) are present but could be embodied more in moment-to-moment micro-choices rather than largely as a single pivot once the manuscript starts writing itself. The emotional cost of dissolving into the story is felt but somewhat cushioned by the later “critics called it his masterpiece” frame, which partially safety-nets the sacrifice. Secondary “characters” (cameos) are evocative but never become relational crucibles for Elias himself; they operate more as symbolic pressures than as direct interpersonal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to save the arbor and, by extension, her village’s forgotten practices—is clear and rooted in a long-standing avoidance of song in favor of safer stories. The contrast between tinkerer and reluctant singer feels particular and embodied (“stories were safer than songs, which demanded truth”). Internal conflict is present but gentle; once she decides to sing, there’s little in-scene pushback or relapse. The final shift into “keeper of songs” is earned but carries more poignancy than sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to preserve/teach starlight how to stay amid an ending world—is clear, particular, and embodied in her meticulous craft. Interiority is shown through tactile choices (blood, bone needle, apple husks) rather than abstract labels, giving her a distinct, quiet stubbornness. The main evolution is a conceptual shift (“she had not been preserving light. She had been teaching it how to stay”), which feels earned by the preceding ritual. The piece leans more on endurance than overt internal contradiction, so the arc is resonant but slightly narrower than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The locksmith’s motive—to reclaim and preserve wonder, especially for his daughter—is specific, credible, and drives every choice. His interiority is textured and embodied (“cellar of his reason,” the way his breath curls in the cold), with his professional habits coloring perception. The main limitation is a relative absence of on-page contradiction under peak pressure: once he commits to the timer, there’s little visible tug-of-war between obsession and family. The endurance at the end (leaving it running, deferring sharing it with his daughter) reads as an earned, quiet stance rather than a big turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s role as fractal weaver/loom is specific and interesting, and her realization that she is the loom not the weaver provides a credible internal shift with cost. Her motives (to collect and shed burdens) are clear and consistent, and her final self-surrender to the grotto feels earned by prior beats. However, her psychology stays largely at the mythic/archetypal level; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond duty vs. dissolution, which keeps her from feeling fully human-scaled. The villagers remain silhouettes rather than active pressures, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The widow’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: she is “hauntingly practical,” refusing tears while devoting herself obsessively to an almost devotional craft. Her micro-choices (keep carving versus stop, sell versus keep, answer the girl’s question plainly) all reinforce a coherent internal state of grief-as-work. The final renunciation—keeping one lion while accepting that “some things…are only ever passing through”—feels earned by what precedes. The only slight limitation is that her inner conflict is more implied than directly pressure-tested in a live interaction beyond the brief market exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira is sharply realized: the shift from would-be “architect of clouds” to scavenger who hoards other people’s stories creates a specific, textured psyche. Her motive—to keep younger iterations from following her—threads cleanly into her confrontation with the 25-year-old ghost. Internal contradiction (refusing to go back yet surrendering to the lagoon at the end) feels earned rather than rhetorical. A slightly clearer moment of embodied hesitation before the jump could deepen the sense of conflicting impulses under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena’s characterization is vivid and particular—ink-stained engineer, rule-breaking curiosity, “functional creativity”—and her choices (entering the condemned terminal, resurrecting it, then repurposing it) are all well-motivated. The stoic/pragmatic cast of her interiority (“She didn’t cheer. She calculated.”) aligns with her profession and voice. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper on-page contradiction or felt emotional cost; she rarely wavers or experiences genuine internal friction, so the final choice reads more as elegant insight than a pressured renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The scribe’s motivation—to reconcile with the abandoned orrery despite fear of heresy—is clear and consistent, and his final decision to break the crystal and assemble an imperfect device feels earned. Interiority is specific and embodied (“petrichor nostalgia clinging to the air unraveled something in him”), and his gentleness plus long obedience make his quiet defiance credible. Internal conflict (duty to elders vs fidelity to his own work) could be sharpened earlier so the turn feels slightly less preordained. Overall, he reads as a distinct, flawed individual rather than an archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation—unraveling her father’s lies and her own complicity in chasing them—is clear, specific, and drives each choice from steering into the marshes to dropping the ledger. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in objects like the sundial and ledger rather than abstract labels. The final renunciation (keeping the sundial, discarding the ledger) is emotionally legible and feels earned by prior beats. A slight weakness is the neatness of her insight at the end, which edges toward tidy rather than fully conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motives and vocation (“collecting seeds not for their yield, but for the stories knotted into their husks”) are rich and specific, and his actions align cleanly with that identity. His emotional arc from practiced patience to awed responsibility is believable. What’s missing for a higher score is active internal contradiction or a moment where a competing impulse or fear truly challenges his sense of duty. The characterization is strong and polished but not yet revelatory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation and sensibility are clear and particular, and his actions (using the thread, choosing to keep the relics, deciding what story to tell the princess) align with his motives. His interiority has some lovely, specific turns (“write obituaries for the living” as a self-understanding), but rarely shows sharply contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional cost of his choices—especially withholding the locket/thread for now—is only lightly sketched. For a top-tier piece, I’d want at least one moment where his role as comforter conflicts more viscerally with his own need or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aldric’s obsession, loneliness, and stubborn rationalization (“he called it hypothesizing”) are sharply rendered and consistent. His conflicting impulses—knowing the egg is likely dead yet proceeding with near-religious fervor—are embodied in his trembling, ritualistic prep. The final acceptance of a flawed, ugly-beautiful outcome feels earned by his decade of prior behavior and present-scene choices. Relationships are mostly offstage (advisors, mother), but their pressures are felt enough not to be a gap at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora is sharply drawn: the arsonist’s daughter who chooses to fight fire instead of feed it, with motives grounded in compassion and a complex relationship to her father’s legacy. Her micro-choices—sewing the coin, sprinting toward the boy’s cry, returning to the station—consistently reveal her values. The internal contradiction between inherited destruction and chosen protection is active rather than merely labeled. The only slight limitation is that moments of insight verge on thesis statement instead of being fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s interiority is specific and textured—“luminous skeptic,” memories as “sharp-edged things”—and her actions (choosing to pull the memories free despite mistrust) are consistent with a flawed but driven character. The internal contradiction between skepticism, refusal of “patience,” and the impulse to unseal what’s trapped is credible and active on the page. Emotional embodiment is mostly through perception rather than body, but it still reads as lived rather than generic. The final refusal to stay and witness consequences feels like an earned, slightly costly endurance of her own nature rather than an unmotivated exit.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s motive—to break a generational pattern and carry light beyond the garden—is clear and consistent, and the memory-sacrifice is a strong, character-revealing choice. Her interiority is particular (fear of fire, attachment to resonance), but her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized moment-to-moment; the decision to surrender the memory comes a bit too smoothly. We get little sense of genuine hesitation or competing impulses at the exact point of sacrifice. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by the setup of her long frustration with repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carver’s grief, craft-identity, and family role are sharply etched; his shift from solitary, name-focused work to carving “hollows” and sharing the butterfly with his daughter feels earned by prior beats. The father’s ghost presses directly on his blind spot—treating grief as lines rather than spaces—which convincingly motivates change. Interiority is concrete and particular (the slipped chisel, the remembered scream), not generic. The only slight limit is that his resistance to change is more implied than dramatized, keeping the internal struggle just shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is sharply realized: his guilt, ethical fastidiousness, and stubborn need to "balance" the town's lies are all embedded in concrete habits (clock maintenance, the rake ritual). The interplay between professional precision and subversive adjustments creates credible internal contradiction. His final stance—continuing to carve names, including his own—is well-earned by the backstory and present-tense choices. Secondary figures exist only in memory and implication, but that feels intentional rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply rendered: a blithe, gentle gardener whose comfort with the dead makes his curiosity about the tapestry feel inevitable. His micro-choices—persisting through each knot, accepting the dead’s rebuke without flinching, choosing to offer truth to Hester rather than accuse—are all character-consistent. The internal contradiction (blithe vs. knowingly disturbing dangerous echoes) is present but could be slightly sharper under peak pressure. Still, his final stance (“Intentions were just knots waiting to be named”) reads earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s role and motivation are clear and distinctive—an “ignorance cartographer” who maps potential rather than fixed fate is a strong, character-specific frame. Her micro-choices (waiting for the malleable hour, listening before writing, fearing she’s overstepped) track cleanly with that ethos. However, internal conflict is only lightly touched, with minimal contradiction or cost beyond a brief moment of fear. She remains somewhat iconic and idealized rather than deeply flawed or pressured into a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to give the city back its voice after a lifetime of copying others—is vivid and consistent, and his choices (continuing the broadcasts, inviting Lira in) track cleanly with that drive. Interiority is concrete and particular, especially in the way he reads risk against his longing for stories to move on their own. Lira is efficiently but memorably drawn in a few strokes (salt-stiff coat, trembling fingers, dust-guided search). The main limitation is that we get little on-page contradiction or real hesitation in Elias at the peak, so the internal conflict feels implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s sensibility and worldview are vividly particular—her belief that “understanding was the enemy of art” dovetails cleanly with the repeated acts of burning and scattering. The mask origin (mother’s teacup, sister’s accusation) grounds her in a believable emotional history without over-explaining. Internal contradiction exists (craving recognition yet refusing safety/understanding), but it remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete high-pressure choice. The piece lands more as a strong character study than a full micro-arc under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn: bitter, bookish, stubborn, with motives rooted in concrete losses and class resentment, and his decision to stay in the tunnel reads as an earned extension of his earlier refusals to sell or comply. His emotional life is embodied in tactile interactions with junk and the cog rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction (survival vs principle) is present but could be sharpened in-scene at the final stand, where he moves fairly cleanly from resolve to endurance. Veyra functions well as a status foil and mouthpiece for institutional pressure without collapsing into caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply etched through his tactile attention to the rosette and his preoccupation with absence, and the four remaining singers each get one precise, embodied detail that makes them feel particular (tremor, humming, flinch, bullet-scarred folder). His motivation—to keep some form of choir alive in the wake of hatred—is clear and consistent. The internal conflict between grief for what’s lost and his quiet persistence is understated but legible in his choice to hum “the shape” of a tune instead of trying to recreate the old choir. This is strong work; a slightly more pressured or risky on-page choice could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and textured—his history with his family, mentor, and critics clearly motives his retreat to the greenhouse and his hunger for a different way to “feed.” His central choice (cook with the fruit for the homeless rather than sell or hoard it) tracks cleanly from those traits. The shift from “chef” to “gardener of moments” is earned, though his internal conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with limited on-page resistance or self-sabotage. A touch more mess or risk in his decision would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply rendered: the hereditary duty, rough hands, “affliction of truth,” and his fear that the Last Wonder might fail all cohere into a specific, embodied person. His main contradiction—duty-bound custodian of a system that has killed wonder, yet custodian of the Last Wonder itself—plays credibly through his choice to spend the seed. Emotional beats are felt but not over-explained. Secondary characters (the girl, baker, old man) are sketched but used effectively as mirrors rather than full characters.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s motivation—to understand why some spaces feel alive—is clear and consistently expressed, and her final shift toward “listening” feels earned. The interiority is concrete and sensory rather than generic, especially in how she registers small strangenesses (“streetlights…like a held note from a cello”). However, we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or pressure on her values; she moves fairly serenely toward insight. The cost of her final renunciation (leaving the shard) is subtle and could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora is vivid and motivated—her long stewardship, telepathic tact, and relationship to the child-heart feel specific and consistent, and her choice to guide rather than overpower the human is well earned. The intruder’s arc from zealotry to surrender works, but they remain somewhat generic (no individuating detail beyond role and mission), which slightly blunts the emotional cost. Internal conflict is present (“You’re in my head” / trembling over the ampoule, knees hitting the floor), but it’s sketched more mythically than concretely. The final surrender (ripping off the helmet) is thematically resonant yet could use one more beat of individuated fear or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena’s motives are clear and consistent—from the long, fatigue-less climb to the refusal of the door—and her “grim optimism” plus intellectual stubbornness give her choices weight. The desire to “capture the texture of a missed opportunity” is specific and credibly odd, not generic regret. Interiority is concrete and object-mediated (the dice, the biting edge, the warmth of the door) rather than abstract summary. A touch more in-the-moment ambivalence at the door itself could deepen the felt cost of her refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The painter’s insomnia, gentle obsession with lost languages, and belief in remembered kindness give him a clear, specific interior life, and his dogged ritual across forty-three nights reads as deeply motivated. His contradiction—bone-tired yet meticulous, skeptical yet “methodically hopeful”—feels earned rather than declared. The small but real shift from wakeful compulsion to surrendering to sleep and resuming with renewed calm is a credible arc at this length. The absence of any fully on-page second character limits relationship dynamics, but the remembered calligrapher and imagined child effectively pressure his solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motivation—to preserve vanishing arts and memory—is clear, consistent, and drives her decisions with credible emotional texture. Her embodied reactions (shaking hands, hitched breath, fingers “remembering the curves before her mind did”) give her specificity without lapsing into stock feeling labels. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she both reveres preservation (museum, grandmother’s legacy) and chooses a violent, iconoclastic act (shattering the lens) to achieve it. The main limitation is that her inner conflict at that break point is under-dramatized; the decision lands more as thematic necessity than a fully pressured moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s obsession and motivation (“not to mend time but to unmake it”) are vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices—coming to the lighthouse, wiring the mechanism, stepping onto the stones—track cleanly with that drive. Interiority is textured (“time stuck to some people like tar, while others slipped through it like smoke”), giving him a particular worldview rather than a generic mad scientist vibe. Internal conflict is present but underdeveloped: he weighs “warnings or invitations,” yet rarely feels genuinely torn in the moment of no return. The final renunciation of the future-as-given is earned, but it could land harder with a sharper sense of what he’s leaving behind beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysander’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: he’s both repulsed by and dependent on the curse, entering the funhouse to confront the thing that “wears [his] face” while deploying deception (“I’m not here to fight”) as a tactic. His interiority is embedded in concrete objects (the clasp, the filmstrip) rather than abstract labels, and his final acceptance of a still-cursed self feels earned. The advisor functions as a psychological pressure rather than a full character, but that suits the scope. The one limitation is that his emotional struggle in the confrontation resolves quickly, with little on-page wavering once he commits to the lunge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leeward’s interiority is vivid and specific—his synesthetic reading of clouds, the history of the wrecked junk, and his delight in resistance all feel character-particular. His motivation (to “dub” the storm rather than master it) is clear and consistently plays through his choices of where and how to strike. Internal conflict (awe and danger vs restless curiosity) is present but relatively gentle; he is never forced into a sharply costly decision. The final shift from fear to “thrill of the next note” is earned but low-stakes, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elyas’s motivation—gnawing certainty that the watchers are waiting for him—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, including his final walk toward the screaming gate. His competence (decoding shells, pattern languages) is well dramatized and avoids generic “chosen one” vibes. Internal contradiction (curiosity vs. self-preservation, loyalty to the city vs. pull of the expedition) is present but largely implied rather than felt through in-the-moment struggle. The ending endurance/renunciation—leaving the city and accepting the invitation—is earned, though the emotional cost could be embodied more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is cleanly motivated by a long-term, specific drive ("recapture" of truth) and his behavior under pressure is consistent with a cautious, principled academic. His emotional life is sketched rather than deeply dramatized—"emotionally rational as ever" gestures at contradiction but we don’t fully feel the cost of that restraint. Callahan is more function than person, though his status and righteousness read clearly in dialogue. The final stance—Elias refusing to flee while foreclosing any hope of comfortable complicity—feels earned, if a touch under-internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is specific, motivated, and consistent: his compulsion to “wrest meaning from what others abandoned” credibly drives his choices. Details like the inherited inkwell, the ex-wife who chose “a life without ghosts,” and his fixation on cracks as whispers ground him as a particular person, not a type. Internal conflict (duty vs obsession, living vs haunting the past) is present but rarely sharpened into on-page dilemma. The closing commitment to being an “archeologist of abandoned dreams” feels earned but not hard-won under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to seek “honest origins” amid erasures—is clear, consistent, and elegantly tied to his profession, and his calm, methodical nature feels specific rather than generic. Interiority is present and textured (“his pulse steady, his mind tranquilly perceptive”), but he remains largely without visible internal contradiction; the tension between craving stillness and chasing truth is more conceptual than felt. His final stance—keeping the discovery private while continuing his work—reads as an Earned Stasis, though the emotional cost is subtle rather than sharply dramatized. Adding one or two moments where his composure nearly cracks would deepen him from strong to indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lantern maker’s grief, craft, and motive (recovering her daughter’s voice / managing the isle’s descent) are clear and consistent, with strong embodied emotion (“folding her grief into something small enough to carry”). Her micro-choices—continuing the work, polishing and placing the gem, then letting go—align with that motive and reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction (wanting to contain grief vs. surrendering fully to the basilica/dreams) is present but could surface more sharply in on-page hesitation or self-deception. We never get much beyond her grief-identity into other specific traits, which slightly flattens her as a full person.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s grief, analytical mind, and almost predatory relationship to “potential” are specific and consistent, and her choice at the console is clearly rooted in those traits. Interiority is concrete (“burnt sugar and copper,” watching morgue footage of herself), and her refusal to aim for changing the past in favor of “hunting” it feels earned. There is some room to deepen contradiction around her father and the lost wedding partner, but what’s here reads psychologically coherent. The final shift from survivor to “the perturbation” is a credible endurance/renunciation stance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is specific and consistent, from her sharp observational bias (“gaps in the world”) to the ache of “the frequency of belonging.” Her choice to steal the chip is clearly motivated by that loneliness, and the final acceptance of the pilgrim’s hand feels like an earned soft turn. The pilgrim is thinner but functional as a foil whose own hunger mirrors hers. The only slight weakness is that a few emotional statements (“She knew that hunger…”) lean toward telling rather than fully dramatizing conflict in action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt, professional self-justifications, and ritualized return to the terrace create a coherent, specific psyche, and his final decision “He would go” feels motivated by years of avoidance. The profession (rewriting bloodlines) meaningfully colors how he thinks about memory and truth. Internal conflict is present but more ruminative than actively contradictory on the page; we rarely see him torn in a live, pressured moment. The change is credible—a move from evasion to engagement—but the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a principled, quietly sentimental negotiator, with the drawer pull, his habits, and his framing of prisoners as “seeds” giving him specificity. Kaelis’s ruthlessness versus visible hesitation, and the boy’s small, fearful question, create credible, differentiated motives. Internal conflict is present but muted—Elias never feels truly tempted to sacrifice the boy for larger strategic advantage, which keeps the moral calculus relatively safe. The final stance (accepting small mercies while the war “limps on”) feels earned and consistent with his prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific, with his identity as “the best navigator” credibly at war with being the man his daughter calls “a ghost with a paddle.” His motives (to flee, to align needle and pulse, to answer the letters) are consistent and deepened by concrete micro-choices: not paddling out, walking to the post office, then to the bar. The emotional contradictions—wanting escape while walking straight into the places that indict him—are well-handled and embodied in objects and setting rather than labels. The final renunciation of leaving-at-sea reads earned and costly: he’s giving up his old competence/status for the uncertainty of showing up.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liam’s motivation is clear and layered—guilt, suspicion of his own capacity for empathy, and a desire for some kind of reset—even as he doubts whether he wants what the clinic promised. His internal conflict is dramatized rather than told, especially in the decision to throw the ball and then to face the man from the alley. The bodily and emotional beats (“the hollow behind his ribs,” the steady hands at the coffee stand) anchor his arc. The only minor limitation is that his darker, more self-sabotaging side could surface with a bit more bite under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s grief and reluctance are specific and convincing, from her calloused hands and stillness to her angry address to the moon. Her motivation—to get her brother back despite disbelief—is clear and drives increasingly costly choices. The realization that “the metamorphosis wasn’t his. It was hers.” is well earned by prior beats. The brother’s apparition is thin but sufficient for this length, keeping focus on Liora.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s motives (finding the crack, recovering her brother, confronting accumulated time) are clear and consistently embodied, and her interiority feels particular in lines like “the kind of woman who chased riddles into the dark and called it devotion.” Her flaw—hoarding grief—is dramatized rather than labeled and is directly challenged in the climax. The brother’s presence is brief but sharp, functioning as a relational crucible that forces her to confront “repentance for time.” The final renunciation (“She didn’t weep. She unfastened.”) is emotionally earned and forecloses the path of endless vigil with a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lien’s motivation—to reopen the sealed dimension and end a centuries-long limbo—is clear and consistently dramatized through her painstaking, ritualized work. Her emotional life is conveyed more through image than concrete contradiction, but we do get a glimpse of tension in “She had never been afraid of the dark, only of what waited in the light.” Micro-choices (not cursing, reading “Try again,” picking up the needle) reveal a quiet, obsessive persistence that earns the final step through the tear. A bit more textured ambivalence or cost around leaving the *Eulogy* could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s core drives—destitute generosity and a fascination with transformation—are clear and consistently embodied in her choices, especially the final sacrifice of the vials. Interiority is specific and textured (“because of course she would fulfill it by accident”), avoiding stock emotional language. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she fears the prophecy and yet laughs into it, both wary and complicit. The cost of trading her “wealth” (the vials/lightning bugs) for fire reads, but the emotional struggle at that peak could be shaded with one more beat of resistance to reach top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and compelling (the ledgers, the disappeared villagers), and his competence is convincingly grounded in his history as lock sentinel. Interiority is selective but specific—the “cradle of sparks” and his reaction to the ledgers do meaningful character work. However, he faces almost no doubt or internal friction in the moment, so contradictory impulses under pressure are faint. The final choice feels more like the completion of a plan than a difficult renunciation with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motives (to read the patterns, to answer the grandmother’s promise, to manage her curse) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—placing rocks, seizing the dust, pushing back—track well. The eel-herder backstory and the curse give her specificity beyond archetype. However, contradictory impulses under pressure (terror vs duty, desire to refuse vs compulsion to obey the promise) stay more implied than dramatized in-scene. The cost of becoming the promise’s keeper is stated through images rather than deeply felt in her embodied reactions at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is sharply rendered: a censored poet whose scars, darkroom past, and fixation on the “too precise” poem create a coherent, particular psyche. His internal conflict—whether the poem/scars are roads or warnings—plays against concrete micro-choices (hiding, unfolding, pressing to the dome, tearing, leaving). The final renunciation (shredding the poem, walking away) is well-earned by prior setup and clearly costs him something real. There’s a slight safety in how lucidly he names his own psychology, but it doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias and Liora are sharply sketched with distinct motives—intellectual pride, political leverage, and a need to be understood—and their status dynamic shifts credibly from opponents to partners. The mechanical arm, her rapier, and her “diplomatic mask” all reveal character through action rather than exposition. Interiority is present but fairly light; we infer more than we feel Elias’s internal contradictions. The final decision to walk away from the Council feels earned but could carry more embodied emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is sharply etched—his cracked fingers, hoarded poems, and name-molting itch make him feel particular and alive, and Maren has clear edges as a steady, practical counterpoint. His core motives (forging beauty from ruin, building the library, the compulsion to change identities) are coherent and interwoven. The lie about “only as far as the next book cart” gives a clean glimpse of internal conflict, but that conflict never forces a truly costly choice on the page. Emotional embodiment leans more lyrical than raw, so the turmoil around leaving vs. staying remains somewhat gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s combination of ritualistic hoping (winding a dead clock, studying erratic compasses) and decisive agency (splicing the reel, walking into the film) feels specific and coherent. Her emotional life is mostly shown through objects and atmosphere rather than deep interior contradiction, but the tension between resignation and stubborn planning is legible. The lover is more emblematic than individuated, yet his brief presence still reconfigures her arc rather than stealing it. The final choice—to confront him with “You’re late” while sitting down to a new piano—reads earned and character-driven, though the felt cost is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation—to protect the island’s memory at the cost of her own mind—is clear, consistent, and escalates credibly from cataloging distortions to biting the seed. Her interiority feels specific (“a taste like the first question ever asked”) and grounded in her vocation. There is some internal conflict (fear vs duty), but it could be more actively dramatized at the exact decision beat rather than already feeling resolved. The final transformation into the island’s voice is well-earned by her prior choices and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief, stubbornness, and tenderness are rendered with concrete, character-specific detail (the bonsai-as-ship, the slow speech) and his choice to “plant” the compass is clearly motivated by his need to rework his relationship to regret. The internal contradiction—wanting to hold on vs. learning to let memory move through him—is present, if understated. His emotional responses feel embodied rather than labeled. The main limitation is that his flaws and blind spots under pressure are more implied than actively dramatized against on-page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dr. Voss is a distinct, thoughtful protagonist whose background in physics enriches the narrative perspective. However, the colleagues serve as "strawman" antagonists with dialogue ("You study collapsing stars, not dead flowers") that feels artificial and exists solely to set up the protagonist's rebuttal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora's interiority is vivid, but her decision-making dissolves into abstraction at the climax. Dropping the ledger—the only concrete map to her brother—to follow "patterns in the frost" undermines her competence and lowers the stakes of the search. The shift from a desperate survivor to a philosophical wanderer feels unearned by the immediate pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Liora's motivation is clear and drives the scene, but her internal landscape relies on high-concept shorthand ("salt in her veins") rather than contradictory human impulse. The physical cost ("fingers bleeding onto the keys") is a genre cliché that substitutes for a more specific, personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a distinct, weary presence whose internal life drives the narrative. His motivation—restoring peace—is palpable, though the phrase "cracked from salt and sorrow" leans slightly into melodramatic labeling rather than embodied detail. The shift from observer to active participant is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias functions as a noble archetype rather than a fully realized character; he lacks internal conflict, flaws, or specific micro-choices under pressure. His "reluctant consensus" leadership is stated in summary rather than dramatized through interaction, and his motivations remain static and purely altruistic without the friction of personal cost or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias lacks internal conflict, moving through a linear ritual without contradictory impulses or doubt. His emotions are rendered through diagnostic labels ("certainty that this was the spark") rather than embodied reactions, making his final transformation feel performed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s arc from "unbuilding" to "designing edges" creates a satisfying conceptual shift that feels earned by her experience in the maze. Her agency is active, though her interiority occasionally slips into abstract diagnostic language ("fractal patterns") rather than remaining fully embodied in the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lena reads as a hyper-competent archetype rather than a living character; she executes a complex plan without internal conflict, doubt, or error. The "chained liberator" identity is delivered via backstory summary rather than demonstrated through difficult choices or behavioral quirks in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is defined by sensory reception and a backstory told in summary; the sister's betrayal lacks dramatized weight in the present moment, making his motivation feel theoretical rather than visceral. The choice to surrender to the water is a mood beat rather than a character-revealing decision born of conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora is established with a distinct, obsessive motivation ("collected illuminated moments") that drives the narrative well initially. However, the climax shifts from character-driven agency to metaphysical abstraction ("She *became* it"), dissolving her specific human struggle into a generic ascension trope without a clearly defined personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich, blending her artisan background with the mechanical legacy of her father. The specific habit of speaking to the machine ("narrating aloud") effectively grounds her character in both her past workshop life and present isolation. Her motivation to trigger the "controlled collapse" is earned through the discovery of the bookmark, though the emotional transition from avoiding the room to destroying it moves rapidly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's stunt background informs her perception effectively (decoding the cast via "pressure here, pivot there"). However, the shift from paralyzing fear to confidence feels slightly rushed, and the "liability" backstory relies on efficient but heavy expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Characterization is functional but relies on abstract definition ("mildly obsessed") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist feels more like a vessel for the thematic conceit than a living person, and the interiority is delivered through repetitive syntactic patterns rather than specific, shifting emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    X-7's interiority is clearly focused on the central question, and the "bleeding fingers" memory provides a grounded moment of embodied cost. However, the transition from janitor to cosmic philosopher is abrupt; the character functions more as a vessel for the theme than an agent grappling with genuine resistance, resolving the core conflict through immediate realization rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lena functions as a magical catalyst rather than a fully realized protagonist; her intervention is intuitive to the point of implausibility. She faces no internal resistance or genuine dilemma, resolving the conflict without risking her safety or status. The emotional arc relies on stock "wise observer" tropes rather than specific, embodied character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static archetype of the "wise elder" without internal conflict or flaws. The antagonists (the elders) undergo an implausible, instant psychological reversal ("fuller hearts") based on a single visual cue, which violates the "Blind spots and limits" and "Relationships as crucible" standards.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but the character reads as a standard archetype (the intuitive rogue) with limited internal contradiction. The "mechanically warm" trait appears as a label rather than a deep aspect of personality, and the lack of hesitation regarding the "twelve protocols" lowers the sense of personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal shift from observer to participant is clear, and the desire to "disrupt" the silence motivates the central action. However, the emotional stakes feel somewhat atmospheric rather than visceral; the internal struggle is resolved a bit too smoothly through the ghost's instructions rather than a difficult, cost-heavy choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from "fault-tolerant" endurance to nihilistic acceptance is compellingly rendered. The fever provides a plausible catalyst for this radical pivot, though the choice to embrace destruction feels slightly more lyrical than psychologically grounded. The rejection of her role as an oracle of safety is earned through the "hollowed out" clarity established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is distinct and deeply integrated with the setting; Elias seeks "weight" rather than scrap, a specific internal drive that recontextualizes the scavenger archetype. The internal shift from skepticism to accepting the burden ("His [shift] had just begun") is an Earned Stasis that feels costly and inevitable. The physical interaction with the wheel anchors his emotional arc in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist is distinct but largely passive, defined by resignation rather than active struggle in the scene. The loss of humanity is summarized ("stopped being a person") rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice or costly interaction. While the internal logic is consistent, the lack of contradictory impulses reduces the character to an observer.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias is a competent, distinct focalizer, but he lacks internal friction or contradiction; he functions more as a vehicle for the cure than a character under pressure. His "itch" to heal is satisfied without personal cost or difficult trade-offs, making his journey feel linear and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias functions as a consistent atmospheric vessel, but his passivity limits dramatic engagement; he receives the offering rather than pursuing it. The specific prompt phrasing ("sensitively perceptive fingers") appears as a diagnostic label that flattens the tactile immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent, but the emotional arc—from trembling hands to a confident laugh—feels slightly unearned by the on-page action, relying on a pre-planned escape that mitigates struggle. Interiority is clear but often leans on expository summary of his worldview ("Chen didn't believe in fate") rather than fully dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by his philosophical motivation ("illumination"), but he lacks internal conflict or doubt, reading more as an archetype than a person. The emotional weight of the "student's face" is stated but not embodied; the priest executes his plan without hesitation, reducing the dramatic friction of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Li Wei is drawn with exceptional specificity; the "homesickness as a when" insight grounds his internal conflict. The shift from passive oracle to active conductor is earned through the memory of the father and the shell, culminating in a choice that reclaims his agency against the city’s demand.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s internal struggle is physically grounded effectively through the "weightlessness" trait, which resolves satisfyingly at the end with gravity settling. However, the "shadow self" serves more as a symbolic prop than a fully realized antagonist, and the motivation ("conquest of the self") feels slightly stated rather than purely dramatized in the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s sensory experience of deafness is grounded and evocative, particularly the tactile focus on vibration. However, the backstory of the "boy’s sneer" feels stock, and his emotional pivot—from total despair to renewed purpose—resolves too rapidly after a single external intervention, lacking a graduated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is drawn with consistent solitary discipline, and his internal conflict between safety and the compulsion to witness is compelling. The explicit labeling of his "credibly curious nature" is a minor "tell" that shortcuts dramatization, but his reaction to the message authentically captures his meticulous worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s arc is defined by a clear shift from preservation to destruction. His initial "aromatic caution" effectively establishes a constraint that he breaks to trigger the climax. While the "bitter and soft" laugh borders on melodramatic cliché, his decision to smash the lanterns and leave creates a high-cost, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is archetypal and somewhat passive, observing rather than driving the narrative until the final beat. The trait "ethically playful" is told rather than dramatized through friction or difficult trade-offs prior to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s internal state of mourning and stewardship is rendered with specific, embodied detail, though the insertion of "acoustically perceptive ears" reads as a tell-y trait label rather than shown capacity. The interaction with the girl is gentle and shifts Liora’s stance naturally, but the final choice feels slightly more poetic than strictly pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s transition from transaction to intervention is driven by a clear internal code, and the "static" mechanic effectively externalizes the chemist's internal state. While the chemist’s tearful reaction is slightly standard, Liora's choice to absorb the "ache" herself provides a strong, cost-bearing character moment that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Character motivation relies on a sudden, undramatized shift from "calculus of profit" to sentimentality triggered by lighting. The connection between the protagonists hinges entirely on a lottery-odds coincidence (the locket) rather than organic chemistry or agency. Elias fits a standard "rogue with a heart of gold" template without specific, complicating flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Reed functions more as a thematic vessel than a vivid individual; her motivation is clear but lacks internal friction or conflicting impulses. The characterization leans heavily on "sympathy" as a declared trait rather than a tested quality, with little resistance to her goals. Relationships are frictionless; Syl accepts the intrusion instantly, missing an opportunity for genuine status dynamism or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elspeth is a grounded, distinct protagonist whose profession organically frames her perception of the world. However, the antagonist's "clever girl" dialogue is a stock trope that momentarily flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—precision vs. ambiguity—is dramatized effectively through the ritual. The shift from an obsessive need to "solve" grief to an earned acceptance of loss is motivated by the on-page failure of the spell to fully restore the past.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's internal state is well-rendered, but the connection to the woman relies on a strained coincidence (he happens to carry her specific tape and photo without knowing who she is). The sudden shift from seventeen years of hiding to revealing himself feels slightly unearned by the "jagged" outage alone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's internal arc relies on diagnostic epiphanies ("It needed her to let go") rather than pressure-driven choices. The pivot from control to surrender happens via intellectual realization at a microscope rather than an emotional crucible or failure. The characterization is consistent but the transformation feels unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Character motivation is articulated ("wring some truth") but lacks the friction of genuine agency; Elias complies with the island's supernatural prompts without significant resistance or doubt. The internal weariness is well-established, but his choices feel led by the setting rather than driven by active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    Liora is a passive recipient of the story's lesson; her epiphany ("suddenly she understood") is delivered via the entity's monologue rather than earned through struggle or choice. The shift from seeker to enlightened happens instantaneously without internal friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, motivated protagonist with clear internal logic. His transition from collecting fragments to accepting silence is well-charted, though the middle section's summary montage ("Word spread") distances the reader from his internal cost during that phase. The specific attribute "reactively visionary" is told rather than fully dramatized in the moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s shift from obsession to acceptance is legible, and the "route mapper" trade integrates well with his psychological need for control. However, the sister functions primarily as a thematic device rather than a fully realized character, and the dialogue feels instructional rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora’s internal conflict between skepticism and grief-driven yearning is well-established and drives the narrative. However, the epiphany relies on diagnostic labeling ("courageously kind thought") rather than purely dramatized realization, slightly distancing the reader at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lysander is a consistent rendering of the "bored immortal" trope, but his internal conflict is low-friction; the desire for "goodbye" faces no internal resistance. The introspection ("slow poison") relies on familiar summaries rather than embodied struggle, and the lack of a true counter-impulse makes his choice feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s motivation is tightly wound with her father’s legacy, creating a compelling internal conflict between rigid "math" and necessary chaos. Her interiority is specific and grounded ("decoding the math of his cons"), driving the narrative arc toward a earned realization about the nature of debt. The girl functions effectively as an external pressure that forces Lira’s hand.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for the concept, observing and transcribing without facing contradictory impulses or meaningful resistance. His success is immediate and costless, resulting in a static emotional arc lacking the friction or depth required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Daniel is a distinct, melancholic presence whose internal contradictions—gathering proof of existence while fading from it—drive the narrative. The final choice to shed the accumulated history rather than reclaim it is a strong, earned reversal of the "quest for identity" trope, delivering visible cost. The emotional logic is embodied and rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is defined largely by descriptors ("myth buster," "accidental poet") rather than action, and his pivot from skeptic to believer feels rushed. The epiphany is delivered externally by the voices in the shell rather than earned through an internal struggle or difficult choice, making the character arc feel passive.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elira’s internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices; she is firmly aligned with Lumina from the start. The "culture shock absorber" role feels like a backstory label rather than a driver of present interaction, as she acts primarily as a resistance operative without mediating.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivation is sharply drawn, with the tension between his role (inspector) and his intent (preservation) driving the scene. Interiority is vivid, though the emotional summary near the end ("Men of the space age didn't cry") relies on a generalized label rather than purely embodied cost. The final gesture with the camera screen effectively grounds the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a static "competence monster" who diagnoses and solves the central problem without internal struggle, error, or doubt. His blindness serves as a superpower rather than a constraint, and his interaction with the crisis lacks a visible emotional or physical cost, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions competently as a vessel for the concept, but her interiority relies on asserted labels ("wit as dry as ink stains") rather than demonstrated complexity. Her acceptance of the sacrificial role is immediate and frictionless, lacking the internal contradiction or struggle that would deepen engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetypal cipher functioning as a plot device rather than a character. He lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine doubts; his "patience" serves as a label for passivity rather than a dramatized struggle against impulse. The absence of a personal cost or difficult choice flattens the emotional arc into a procedural task.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s internal landscape of guilt is vivid, and her decision to uncork the vial carries earned weight. However, the shift to summary in the final section distances the reader from her immediate emotional reality during the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer, his internal landscape shaped by a specific mythic burden that colors his perception ("raised on voices that weren’t there"). The motivation to "rewave" the echoes is distinct and drives agency, though the emotional cost of the father's specific sin remains slightly abstract until the final extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s internal drive—a hunger born of ancient debt—is compelling and clearly drawn, grounding the supernatural in palpable emotion. The dynamic between her and the Keeper adds needed friction, though the cyclic nature ("Again?") slightly blunts the sense of singular, decisive risk in this specific instance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist's agency is severely severely compromised by the sleepwalking mechanic, as pivotal actions occur without conscious decision or struggle. The attribute "haunting optimism" is asserted via labels ("poetic weaver") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, leaving the character as a passive vessel for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a functional protagonist for a fable, consistent in his reverence for roots over miracles. However, his internal conflict is resolved too easily; his skepticism offers no resistance to the plot, and he pays no emotional or physical price for the resolution, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena is a consistent, atmospheric focalizer whose skills and worldview are established early. However, she lacks internal contradiction or high-pressure agency; the "hesitation" at the mailbox is a low-stakes beat that feels more procedural than a crucible of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a distinct, archetypal figure whose choice to sacrifice himself drives the narrative. However, his internal landscape lacks friction; the decision to stay is immediate, bypassing the potential for a deeper struggle between survival and duty. The "foolishness" trait is stated but operates mostly as flavor rather than a constraint that shapes his interactions or tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s internal conflict is legible, and her motivation to reconcile is clear. However, her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("time pretending to be kind," "paper soft as a pulse") rather than specific, grounded character traits. The emotional arc resolves smoothly, but the character feels more like a vessel for the atmospheric prose than a distinct individual with idiosyncrasies.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena is drawn with strong interiority and a consistent worldview, but her empathy functions almost as a flawless superpower. The lack of a dramatized blind spot or struggle in "reading" the boy limits complexity; she solves his trauma without risk or error.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora is a functional protagonist with a clear role, but her internal landscape lacks the friction required for higher bands. Her motivation ("to rediscover lost joy") is stated via exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices or conflicting impulses. The emotional stakes feel asserted rather than embodied; her "trembling" hands signal importance, but the absence of hesitation or personal cost makes the character arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear, but the "weight of certainty" is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through a specific pre-magic dilemma. The transition from fear to grinning acceptance happens rapidly, skipping the beat of genuine struggle or hesitation that would make the choice to leave reality feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias relies on stock archetypal labels ("charming rogue," "misplaced charm") rather than dramatized complexity. He lacks internal contradiction or a distinct flaw that makes his defiance difficult; his competence is high mainly because the antagonism is low.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist serves as a mythic archetype rather than a psychological agent. While consistent with the fable mode, she lacks the "contradictory impulses" and "blind spots" required for higher bands; her "unstoppable" nature removes the internal friction or possibility of failure that generates character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s internal arc is sharply defined, pivoting convincingly from preservation to destruction when the cost of her work becomes undeniable. Her motivation is clear and embodied, though the initial description of her "gently systematic grace" tells rather than shows her competence. The final resignation feels earned by the magnitude of the catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is a competent protagonist with clear motivation (penance), but her defining trait ("carefully reckless") is stated rather than dramatized through a choice that carries visible cost. She succeeds without a stumble or sacrifice that tests this specific flaw; the victory feels smooth and lacks the grit of a character truly cornered by their own nature.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora is a competent protagonist with a distinct, professionally grounded worldview ("gears so intricate they could weep"). However, the antagonist force (the elders) reads as a monolithic straw man, offering no genuine interpersonal friction or complexity beyond a single expression of rigidity. The emotional arc from hesitation to resolve is clear but feels slightly mechanical without a deeper internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is vividly realized through embodied trauma—the flinch at silence is a potent, consistent motif. His shift from avoidance to engagement is earned through concrete interaction with the birds and the meteorite, grounding the emotional arc in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist's reaction to finding his child—missing for three days—lacks visceral urgency or medical concern, replaced by a philosophical acceptance that feels unearned. Liora functions as a "wise child" plot device rather than a character, delivering thematic sermons ("The center isn't the middle") that shatter emotional realism. The interaction reads more like a fable than a human crisis, flattening the stakes established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kael’s dialogue about his scar ("holding onto something too tightly") is a melodramatic cliché that flattens his character into a prop. The connection between Elara and Kael lacks friction or negotiation; their immediate, perfect understanding feels unearned and convenient rather than authentic. Motivation is stated abstractly ("trying to prove... home wasn't a place but a frequency") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the concept than a distinct character; her epiphany ("inside her all along") is a diagnostic realization unearned by the preceding struggle. The internal arc resolves via a "soft reset" triggered by a symbolic convenience (the blood match) rather than a hard-won choice or genuine psychological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's motivation is clear, but he reads as a romanticized archetype of the misunderstood genius rather than a nuanced individual. The dialogue leans heavily into aphorism ("You played us" / "I played the space between"), transforming the interaction with the woman into a lecture rather than a genuine human moment. His internal state is rendered through philosophical assertion rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the character reads more as a poetic construct than a person; interiority relies on abstract labels ("nostalgia," "memory," "exile") rather than embodied emotion. The decision to "fledge" is pre-determined, reducing the scene to a procedural execution without the friction of a difficult, real-time choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elias is a consistent, reflective presence, but he functions more as an observer than a protagonist under pressure. The lack of a difficult choice or internal contradiction results in a static emotional arc; he begins and ends in the same state of quiet certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and poignant, grounded in the conflict between his trauma and his love for his daughter. However, his interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("How do you hand pain to someone else...") that feels more like an essayist’s analysis than a firefighter’s embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora serves more as a vessel for the story's abstract concepts than a flesh-and-blood protagonist; her motivation ("equations for hope") is intellectual rather than visceral. Her interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("hope became thinner than air") which distances the reader from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct, melancholic focalizer, and his shift from observer to participant is a valid arc. However, the emotional pivot from burden to liberation feels slightly rushed, relying on the magical dissolution of the door rather than a fully dramatized internal struggle. The motivation is clear, but the "weight of legacy" is told more than demonstrated through difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora creates a distinct atmospheric presence, but her characterization relies heavily on archetypal function rather than internal depth. The "vanishing" at the ending undermines her groundedness as a protagonist, reading more as a convenient exit than a character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Veyra and Kael are distinct archetypes, and the internal tension in Veyra (tremor vs. training) is handled well. However, the dialogue leans heavily into melodramatic "trailer moments" ("You want me to sign my name to another grave?") rather than naturalistic exchange, which keeps the characters at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is distinct, but his arc is largely retrospective; he arrives at the salt flat fully decided, rendering the scene a ritualistic procession rather than a crucible of active choice. The transition from amoral hoarder to penitent feels summarized rather than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora is an archetype rather than a character; her "chaste courtesan" role is a label that never constrains choice or generates specific behavior. The description of her body as a "living poem of restraint" is abstract label-speak that distances the reader from embodied experience. She faces the central conflict with perfect composure ("hands did not tremble"), lacking the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly intellectual ("test a theory"), but the transition from calligrapher to puppeteer feels stated rather than earned by character traits. While the "uncommon stillness" of his hands offers a physical anchor, the emotional stakes rely heavily on a retrospective summary of the miner's rage rather than present-tense vulnerability or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lior's motivation is distinct and enacted through ritual, creating a clear portrait of an "esoteric realist." The closure (gathering new materials) earns the stasis of his character arc, though his interiority occasionally leans into diagnostic labels ("cataloged the weight of wind") rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the internal arc lacks friction; Elira enters with the intent to forgive and succeeds without contradictory impulses or distinct on-page cost. The emotional resolution feels summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and the "forgiveness" arrives via magical success rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lior functions primarily as a witness to the bunker's lessons rather than an active agent; her pivotal shift is a realization ("Lior understood then") rather than a decision born of conflicting desires. While the interaction with her dream-self attempts to deepen interiority, the emotional cost of sacrificing "certainty" remains abstract and theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's "frugal" nature is distinct and shapes his physical movement and initial worldview effectively. However, the internal pivot from empiricism to faith occurs largely in summary ("Qishti laughed... Of course"), lacking the dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lior’s internal motivation to release resentment is clear and drives the scene, but Kael functions more as a therapeutic device than a resistant character. The brother’s shift from ghost to solid feels earned by the magic rather than specific interpersonal friction, smoothing over the "betrayal" without sufficient emotional grit.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation fluctuates confusingly between seeking "silence/escape" and actively performing a ritual of "recreation" without an earned transition. Interiority relies on abstract poetic summary ("boundaries," "erasure") rather than embodied, contradictory emotion. The protagonist's surrender to the fog feels like a passive dissolution rather than a character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from rigid duty to acceptance is compelling and well-dramatized. The shift is earned through engagement with the setting and memory, culminating in a decisive physical choice (binding the ribbon) that reflects a changed worldview. The character's "quartz-eye" nature adds ironic depth to their blindness regarding the daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Veyra’s motivation ("Danger was the point") feels stated rather than embodied, and her pivot to "protector" happens via external visions rather than internal struggle. The shift in her role is functional for the plot but lacks deep emotional cost or friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is a compellingly cynical focalizer; the interior beat "grief was a renewable resource" perfectly encapsulates his manipulative competence. His final unraveling balances this calculation with a felt, earned cost that recontextualizes his character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("kindling," "spark") rather than embodied emotion or doubt. The lack of hesitation or internal struggle during the ritual makes her feel more like a plot function than a character making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara is a consistent focalizer with a clear initial stance that shifts logically, if somewhat smoothly. The internal transition from archivist to participant feels earned by the fable logic, though the emotional cost of the "merging" is relatively low and lacks visceral resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eldrin’s internal arc from rigid preservationist to adaptive mapkeeper is distinct and earns the ending. The conceptual cost—accepting the erasure of the "library" he swore to protect—is legible, though the physical toll is somewhat generic ("fingers trembled").

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is consistent, but the shift from grief to acceptance feels intellectualized rather than visceral. The epiphany is summarized ("Of course it had never been about...") rather than earned through a high-pressure choice or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the character's internal journey relies heavily on diagnostic summary ("preemptively nostalgic... diagnosed in herself") rather than embodied reaction. The climax is triggered by an external vision rather than an active choice, reducing the sense of agency in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.6)
    Liora functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or genuine risk. Her motivation is stated abstractly ("defy the gravity of hopelessness") without being tested by a hard choice or a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich and specific to her role as a chronicler. Her choice to give up the heirloom cicada demonstrates a tangible cost derived from her grandmother's instruction, grounding her empathy in action rather than just observation. The emotional arc—moving from silence to a shared, tangential connection—is well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is deeply embodied through synesthesia ("tasting" silence), making abstract desires visceral and urgent. The internal logic of the "sprouting" response to claustrophobia is consistent and poignant, driving the protagonist's agency effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elias functions as an archetype rather than a character under pressure; he lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a personal stake in the outcome. He faces no risk of failure and pays no emotional cost, acting solely as a facilitator for the passenger’s arc. The lack of resistance or difficult choices flattens his agency into routine competence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elsin is competent and active, but her internal landscape is sparse. The decision to destroy the throne arrives without a dramatized moment of temptation or hesitation, making the "choice" feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior’s internal state is rendered primarily through poetic abstraction ("tender shadow keeper") rather than grounded psychological specificity. While his motivation to isolate is clear, the pivotal choice to engage with the shadow feels slightly reactive to the apparition's dialogue rather than driven by an internal breaking point. The transition from rigid isolation to release is swift, lacking a visible struggle or moment of oscillation that would heighten the character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lina’s cynicism, rooted in the "Luminous Ascent" backstory, provides a sturdy, distinct worldview that colors every observation. The pivot to "mischief" as the motivation for turning the bolt feels slightly convenient given the weight of her trauma, but her negotiation ("What's the exchange rate?") effectively dramatizes her agency and refusal to be a victim again.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly defined as the "dynasty ender," but his pivotal moment relies on an external instruction—his reflection telling him what to do ("You’ve been striking the wrong note"). This reduces his agency at the climax; the epiphany is given rather than earned through struggle. The shift from failure to bridge is conceptually sound but mechanically passive.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The knight's internal landscape is compelling, shifting from repression to agency through a distinct "performance" metaphor. While his interiority is heavily stylized, the choice to "unsnap" is earned by the pressure of the scene and the program's prompt. The recontextualization of his silence as an "audience" role rather than mere trauma adds specific, character-driven depth to the archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is consistently characterized as a man burdened by his own history, projected onto the files. The parallel between his file and Daniel’s grounds his motivation effectively. However, the emotional arc leans slightly sentimental, and his internal state is often summarized ("broken-hearted since the day") rather than fully dramatized through friction in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena is a coherent focalizer with clear motivation, but her transition from "harmless archivist" to arsonist happens off-page, weakening the character arc's credibility. The "Years later" summary flattens her into a historical footnote rather than a lived consciousness at the moment of highest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is functionally competent, and the choice to return earns a grim stasis. However, he remains a cypher; his motivation is abstract ("hushing a prophecy") without a grounded, personal "why" or a specific fear of the consequences, limiting emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    Liora functions effectively as an archetypal steward, but she lacks internal friction or conflicting desires. Her progression feels ordained rather than chosen through struggle; she accepts the call without doubt or cost until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by his obsession, but his internal arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from "fixing" to "unmaking" feels less like a hard-won psychological pivot and more like compliance with an external magical instruction, lacking a dramatized struggle or visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s internal landscape is rendered with precision, grounding the fantastical elements in a tangible sense of professional and personal rivalry. The shift from envy to understanding is earned through the immediate pressure of the scene, though the speed of her emotional transmutation feels slightly compressed given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora's motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on expository definitions ("Modest fearlessness wasn’t bravery...") rather than demonstrated action under pressure. The realization regarding "integration" arrives instantly without significant resistance or cost, making the character arc feel slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liran’s interiority relies heavily on the "math" metaphor ("equation unfurled... like a wound"), which abstracts his emotional state rather than grounding it in visceral, moment-to-moment choices. The resolution—walking out "body whole" after three months of torture—feels like an unearned "soft reset" of the physical stakes established in the opening. While the "trauma responses" are listed (knee locking, throat sealing), they read as backstory labels rather than active constraints shaping a present-tense dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    Lior functions as a passive observer of poetic phenomena rather than a grounded character with contradictory impulses. Her desire for an anchor is stated abstractly, and she faces no difficult micro-choices or internal resistance that would reveal character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a competent archetype (the perceptive technician) whose specific skills drive the plot, but his internal landscape is thin. The shift from "hired to fix" to "deciding to unmake" is character-driven but happens with minimal on-page struggle or established personal stake, making the climax feel slightly mechanical rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions largely as a plot device to execute the prompt’s instructions; his internal landscape is replaced by abstract assertions ("Elias knew what it meant"). The climax hinges on a massive epiphany—"the system wasn't the world. It was him"—that appears without prior setup or psychological groundwork, rendering the realization unearned. There is no on-page struggle or micro-choice that creates the necessary friction for this character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s internal arc from revolutionary failure to poetic revision is sophisticated and drives the narrative logic. His motivation is distinct, grounded in a specific emotional need that pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is a distinct, well-motivated protagonist whose internal conflict—mending vs. unmaking—drives the narrative. The transition from resistance to sacrificial acceptance ("Elias laughed... because of course") is earned by the established logic of the covenant. His choice to unwind the box carries a visceral, felt cost that defines the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The protagonist’s arc from obsession to renunciation is clear, and the shift from collecting petrichor to silence offers excellent conceptual closure. However, the pivot relies heavily on an explicit memory ("father's voice") delivering the lesson rather than Elias wrestling with the realization through active struggle in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation shifts credibly from commercial survival to artistic legacy, anchored by the carving action. However, the pivot relies on a moment of told realization (“Elias understood: the archway wasn’t a door”) rather than purely dramatized struggle, slightly softening the emotional earnedness of the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liora serves primarily as a vessel for the premise rather than a fully realized character; her "obsession" is stated but lacks dramatized cost or contradictory internal impulses. The emotional arc is linear—curiosity to epiphany—without the friction of competing needs or genuine risk to her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is grounded in a compelling professional shift—from archivist to medium—that earns the internal change at closure. Elias’s interiority is distinct, though the antagonists’ swift retreat leaves his courage slightly untested by genuine resistance; the victory feels more magical than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear agency and competence, driving the restoration through active choice rather than passive wishing. However, his defining trait—the rejection of false comfort—is established through exposition ("He rejected the idea of comfort... he knew better") rather than dramatized via a struggle against a tempting alternative in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Characterization is exemplary; Elias’s specific role as an oath scribe is deepened by the choice to record the &quot;pattern of his fear&quot; rather than the prophecy itself. This micro-choice perfectly dramatizes his internal conflict and professional discipline under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s internal landscape is compelling, anchored by the specific weight of the "seed-hoard" legacy and the threat of erasure ("taken her mother's voice"). Her resolve is enacted through concrete physical details (pressing the cap, refusing to flinch) rather than just stated. The choice to engage the vortex carries felt stakes, and the endurance shown justifies the "furiously tranquil" attribute despite its slightly oxymoronic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias is a distinct, competent protagonist whose expertise drives the narrative. However, the characterization leans heavily on "competence porn"—he solves the problem with relative ease, lacking a deep internal contradiction or a moment where his "humble" nature is truly tested against a visceral personal cost beyond professional anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or flaws, functioning primarily as a vessel for the story's philosophical assertions. His spiritual curiosity is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and his purely correct choices face no genuine opposition or temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on summary ("He knew," "He understood") rather than embodied reaction in the moment. The pivotal choice is reactive to the ghost's permission rather than driven by an internal tug-of-war on the page; he resists in backstory but submits immediately in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias is a functional archetype whose internal struggle ("ache of knowing he was running out of it") is summarized rather than dramatized through specific, immediate friction. The transition from weary observer to active participant relies on an intellectual realization ("He understood then") rather than a character-driven choice forced by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype of the contemplative poet than a specific individual with contradictory impulses. Motivation is clear but static; the character begins and ends with the same belief system, reaffirmed rather than challenged. Extensive interior reflection displaces dramatized agency, keeping the conflict abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elira’s characterization is sharply drawn through physical detail ("knees cracking like old timber") and defiance. Her motivation to "remodel" rather than wither is compelling and drives the narrative. Tomas acts as a necessary counterweight, and his conversion is earned through the on-page demonstration of the sapling's response.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is grounded effectively in the father relationship and professional rejection. The internal pivot from skeptic to believer is legible but relies on rapid assertion ("shield... cracked") rather than a gradual, dramatized erosion of her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coachman is consistent and atmospheric, serving as a functional vessel for the theme. However, he lacks the contradictory impulses or internal friction required for higher bands; his motivation is static, and his actions (planting, listening) face no significant internal opposition or costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rook’s internal landscape of loss is compelling, but the anthropomorphism wavers uncomfortably between canine instinct ("muzzle," "scent") and human-level abstract comprehension of economics and war. While the emotional core is solid, the blend feels more like a fable costume than a grounded perspective, slightly distancing the reader from the physical reality of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira is defined largely by the label "blessed pariah" rather than through interaction or immediate struggle. Her motivation to transcend is clear, but the lack of internal conflict or hesitation before the final leap makes the emotional arc feel linear and predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lirien is a competent archetype whose motivations are clear, but she lacks internal conflict or doubt in the moment, making her feel static. Her victory is secured by prior preparation rather than a difficult on-page choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora’s background as a "crisis actor" is relegated to backstory and does not inform her present tactics or choices, leaving the trait disconnected from the narrative arc. A critical inconsistency in her internal knowledge—identifying first "pain" and then "silence" as the "only" thing the entity cannot digest—undermines her competence and the story's internal reality.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct presence with clear motivation (reclaiming talent), but his interiority often drifts into abstract metaphor ("unspooling of self") rather than embodied emotion. The "mercury-glass eyes" is a vivid trait, but his struggle feels more atmospheric than visceral until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's motivation—redemption for a specific teaching failure—is clear and drives the narrative. However, the emotional arc is smoothed over by the magical elements; the metal absorbing his regret and the girl's immediate lack of accusation bypass the necessary interpersonal friction that would earn the forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora's agency is undeniable, driving the climax directly through a decisive physical act. Motivation is clear, though the transition from her backstory of "innocent mischief" to the radicalism of destroying a sacred site relies heavily on summary rather than on-page emotional processing. The internal state is well-rendered, particularly the tactile connection to the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist's internal conflict is clear, but interiority often relies on poetic labeling ("face half-drowned in doubt") rather than embodied reaction. The "love never mine to fix" beat feels like a generic summary rather than a dramatized memory, slightly flattening the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias is a consistent, legible focalizer driven by a clear need (grief/reconnection). However, the lack of internal resistance or contradictory impulses makes his arc feel like a straight line toward suicide; the choice to jump feels inevitable rather than a hard-won renunciation of life.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is clearly motivated, but Harkin’s sudden transformation from grumbling skeptic to awed believer lacks sufficient friction or psychological grounding. The antagonist’s capitulation feels convenient for the short length rather than earned through genuine interpersonal pressure or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena is a consistent, atmospheric focalizer with a clear past and distinct method ("patchwork navigator"). However, the emotional shift at the end ("weight in her chest felt lighter") feels asserted rather than earned by a specific, high-stakes choice made in this particular scene; she performs a routine ritual without a unique pressure spike to justify the sudden change in state.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s struggle with the "tell" (twitching fingers) versus the "steady hands" at the end dramatizes the internal victory over the virus’s constraint effectively. The choice to ingest the "grief" truffle to physically alter his state is a masterful, embodied micro-choice that grounds the high concept in visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is drawn with atmospheric distinctness, and his internal state is legible. However, his "eccentricity" is asserted ("by necessity, not choice") rather than dramatized through idiosyncratic behavior in the present moment. The central struggle remains internal and somewhat low-stakes; his acceptance of the memory feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s internal conflict between his empirical nature and the chip’s intuition is compelling and successfully dramatizes the shift from logic to faith. The transition to the emotional climax regarding the "child's sob" works as a powerful reveal, though the specific root of this trauma could be planted slightly earlier to maximize the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly layered, transitioning effectively from adult fatigue to a specific childhood bargain that recontextualizes the inciting incident. The internal conflict is resolved through a Decisive Change that feels earned by the established backstory, though the "buried truth" reveal is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characters function primarily as vehicles for the prompt’s thematic requirements rather than living entities. Liora exists solely to deliver the central insight, and Elias’s motivation is abstractly philosophical ("bottle the weight") without grounding in concrete, high-stakes desires. The dialogue is heavy with aphorisms that feel declamatory rather than conversational.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dual-Elias dynamic effectively externalizes internal conflict, and the weariness of the older version contrasts well with the younger's anxiety. However, the pivot from the older Elias’s command ("Distill it better") to the destructive solution ("burn the scrolls") feels slightly rushed; the younger self's resistance needed one more beat of pressure to fully earn the older's concession to destroy the work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias functions primarily as a "Wise Old Man" archetype, dispensing wisdom to a passive visitor rather than struggling with genuine internal conflict. His interiority relies heavily on summarized backstory ("spent a lifetime mapping") rather than active, contradictory impulses in the scene. The moment of connection feels performative, lacking the resistance or awkwardness of real human interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.7)
    Motivation is stated clearly, but interiority relies on "therapy-speak" metaphors rather than embodied emotion. The character's transformation is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict; the realization that "the teacher was wrong" feels unearned by the brief on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s definition as a "gossip-column exorcist" provides a compelling, specific lens for her magic and past actions. However, the dialogue occasionally feels staged to deliver exposition ("You always did love your metaphors"), and the emotional reconciliation relies heavily on the magical externalization rather than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetype for a mythic fable but lacks specific, idiosyncratic interiority. While the choice to destroy the dictionary is clear, the emotional landscape relies on generalized feelings of "weight" and "witnessing" rather than a distinct, embodied personality. The ending attempts to ground him with the "first word" memory, but he remains more a vehicle for the concept than a living character.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias displays clear motivation and competence, with the shift from "shepherd" to "gatekeeper" marking a distinct evolution in self-conception. The decision to alter his count to ninety-eight demonstrates a specific, learned adaptation to the anomaly, proving the internal change through tactic. The father’s legacy provides a solid, if traditional, foundation for his superstitious worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lena is drawn clearly, but her internal arc suffers from a "soft reset" where complex grief is resolved instantly by an epiphany. The motivation ("physics of letting go") reads as abstract therapy-speak rather than embodied drive, and the resolution feels unearned by the struggle shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila's internal conflict—inherited logic vs. intuitive risk—is distinct and drives the narrative arc. Her motivation to find answers tracks clearly from the inciting health crisis, though the transition to "ready to place a bet" relies heavily on internal monologue rather than dramatized pressure in the moment. The emotional logic holds, grounding the magical leap in character history.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias functions effectively as a melancholic archetype, but he lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; he is defined solely by his utility to the caller rather than a personal cost or choice that risks his own status.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    The archivist is consistent and the interiority is lush, but her agency is low; she performs a planned ritual without facing a new, difficult dilemma on the page. The "bitterness" cost is backstory rather than a price paid in the scene, making her feel more like a function of the setting than a dynamic agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena is a competent focalizer with a distinct "logistician" worldview that colors her actions (fixing the radio, trading leverage). However, she lacks internal conflict; she accepts the twist and the thematic lesson instantly without struggle, acting more as a fable archetype than a psychologically deepened character.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s interiority is rich with sensory data but emotionally abstract; his "grief" acts as a generalized label rather than a specific, lived wound. The "healing" arc feels smooth and inevitable, lacking the internal contradictions or resistance that create depth. The resolution—finding courage—feels more like a stated outcome than a dramatized psychological shift earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, contemplative presence with a clear internal struggle that frames the narrative. The shift from regret to acceptance is well-charted, though the epiphany is triggered by the external magical object rather than internal processing, slightly reducing the weight of his agency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias and Liora function efficiently as archetypal partners in a magical realist vignette, but they lack individual interiority or friction. Liora’s "whispering advisor" role is a stated label rather than a dramatized dynamic that forces a choice; they operate in perfect lockstep without interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation pivots on a dime without sufficient dramatic setup; the shift from saving the promise to destroying it hinges on a vague realization ("it was a womb") rather than earned development. Traits like "analytically intuitive" are delivered as backstory labels (telling) rather than demonstrated through behavior in the present scene. The epiphany feels convenient and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lira’s motivation to reclaim her autonomy is clear, but her internal landscape feels largely asserted through high-concept summary ("stolen constellations") rather than embodied struggle. The shift from victim to victor lacks a visceral moment of hesitation or temptation; the "rebellion" is successful without testing her flaws or limits on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lior is a competent focalizer with a clear worldview, but his internal state is often described via summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices. His motivation is stated as a thesis ("proof... that quiet persistence outlasted") rather than felt as a desperate drive, leaving him somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    The characters function as archetypes rather than people; the Guardian is a passive service-provider for the plot, lacking internal agency. The boy’s emotional shift ("He didn't need absolution. He needed to remember...") is delivered via narrator summary rather than earned through dramatized struggle or specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Elias functions as a plot device rather than a character with interior depth; he faces no genuine dilemma and pays no personal price. He moves through the story with perfect confidence and magical knowledge, lacking the contradictory impulses or doubts that create friction. The "unspoken words" serve merely as convenient exposition delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is clearly drawn and consistent, but his internal arc lacks friction; the decision to transform is instantaneous and unopposed, reducing the sense of struggle. The transition from dockworker to creature feels fated rather than chosen through a difficult hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena’s interiority is richly drawn, balancing the performed "mask" against genuine, suffocated grief. The transition from repression to the raw scream feels earned by the accumulation of pressure, and her choice to teach Harkin whittling provides a credible, character-driven shift toward connection.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elira is a consistent, mythic focalizer whose internal arc from respect to rewriting drives the piece. However, she lacks localized internal friction; her certainty arrives early, making the transformation feel like an inevitable apotheosis rather than a hard-won struggle against genuine conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.3)
    Elias is portrayed as an idealized "sensitive artist" figure rather than a conflicted protagonist; his internal state is delivered through summary ("colors had never been the point") rather than dramatized struggle. The "innocently cunning" attribute is absent in action; he reads as purely earnest, and his "learning to love imperfections" contradicts the epiphany at the end where he supposedly realizes it "now."

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    Liora functions as a competent archetypal vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted individual; she lacks internal contradiction or significant flaws. Her journey is smooth and devoid of genuine struggle or error, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lena is a coherent protagonist whose internal state is mirrored well by her craft. However, her emotional pivot relies heavily on the mentor’s posthumous instructions ("The flower in her hands was a lesson") rather than an internal struggle, making the transformation feel slightly passive and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, cohesive focalizer whose "steady curiosity" and esoteric method create a unique worldview. His internal monologue effectively bridges the gap between the mystical and the financial, though he remains somewhat emotionally detached, functioning primarily as a vehicle for the story's conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype with minimal internal conflict; her struggle is resolved via prior knowledge/method rather than in-scene grappling with contradictory impulses. The moment of fear is dismissed too quickly ("Fear was just another pattern") to register as a genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liora is drawn with a delicate hand, but her defining trait—being "half-empty"—feels like a convenient keyhole designed to fit the plot's lock rather than a source of genuine internal friction. Her decision to sacrifice her shadow lacks an alternative or a moment of hesitation; she moves from realization to resolution with a procedural inevitability that flattens her agency. The "dusk noticer" tag creates an aesthetic but doesn't drive tactical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct, sympathetic protagonist with clear motivation (atonement). However, his internal journey feels slightly performative due to the structured "layers" conceit, which dictates his actions more than organic impulse. The backstory is delivered in a somewhat expository block ("Three months ago...") rather than integrated through active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora is a compelling focalizer whose internal struggle between seeking closure and accepting pain is rendered with high specificity. The shift from "decoding" to "carrying" marks a distinct, earned psychological change, though her agency is slightly diminished in the middle beat where the crucial file is revealed to her rather than found by her.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on poetic labels ("thief of echoes") rather than messy, contradictory psychology. The emotional realization at the end feels performed—a standard trope of internalized grief—rather than a visceral shift earned by specific character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.3)
    Liora functions as a cipher for the magic system rather than a character with agency; her internal conflict (doubt vs. creativity) is stated in exposition but dissolved instantly by the archway without struggle. She faces no difficult micro-choices, and her transition from "caged bird" to master is unearned by on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist fits the archetype of the weary guardian well, but his motivation pivots on unearned intuitive leaps ("He knew what it meant") rather than dramatized deduction. The lack of internal friction or doubt during the timeline shift reduces the emotional weight of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as a passive archetype ("the philosopher") with abstract motivations rather than embodied desires. The pivotal change occurs via an intellectual realization delivered in a dream, rather than through a difficult, active choice in the face of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s interiority is consistent, but her pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("unused courage," "courage... for staying") rather than embodied struggle. The transition from duty to rest feels intellectually processed rather than viscerally fought for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer whose physical condition (nerve regeneration) perfectly mirrors the fortress's awakening. His shift from enforcing silence to enabling sound is earned through the visceral tactile details of the bolt and his returning sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veythas is a distinct, mythic focalizer, and his internal landscape of duty versus endurance is well-rendered. The transition from centuries of inaction to the climax is driven by the messages, though the internal struggle regarding the "sacrifice" (Lirien's name) feels slightly inevitable rather than a sharp tactical dilemma on the page. The emotional weight is present, but the personal cost is atmospheric rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lena is a functional protagonist with a clear drive, but her motivation relies heavily on the "wise grandmother" trope rather than dramatized internal conflict. The secondary character, Voss, serves only as a flat foil for skepticism, lacking dimension. While Lena's final choice is decisive, her interiority feels somewhat summarized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena is distinct and grounded, but her interiority feels performed rather than embodied. She functions primarily as a vessel for the magical plot resolution; her "awkward confidence" is stated as a label but does not drive a high-stakes choice or mistake on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora has a distinct voice and clear motivation, but her "insurgent" role lacks genuine struggle as her internal certainty is never challenged. The lack of internal contradiction or costly trade-offs makes her victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is visceral and specifically grounded in the somatic prompt elements. Her contradictory impulse—wanting to freeze time versus the inevitable pull of the present—resolves beautifully through the physical act of releasing the photograph. The transition from trauma survivor to active participant (pruning) is earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for melancholy themes than a living character; her internal state is conveyed through abstract metaphors ("shards of a life") rather than embodied reactions. The motivation to "see the dark" is stated but lacks visceral grounding in her prior failure as an artist.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael is a distinct presence with grounded physical details and a legible internal drive. However, the pivot from hunter to explorer hinges on a sudden cognitive leap regarding the thief's intent that feels more convenient than earned by prior character work. The attribute "consciously wild" appears late as a justification rather than being demonstrated through earlier behavior, which clashes slightly with his established "serene" demeanor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elara functions as a standard dystopian archetype rather than a specific individual. The use of the prompt phrase "bravely conflicted" as a literal diagnostic label ("She’d spent years bravely conflicted") violates the show-don't-tell principle, summarizing complex internal history rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s internal landscape is rich, reconciling her father's violence with her own nurturing role. However, the decision to stay feels like a settled state recalled from memory ("You were supposed to leave") rather than a choice actively forged against the immediate rising pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s stoicism ("didn't flinch") is balanced by a deeply felt, earned renunciation. The conflict between thirty years of chasing and the final choice to "let it drown" demonstrates high agency and emotional cost. The internal arc perfectly mirrors the external action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lydia is passive in the pivotal moment; although she initiates a search, the resolution arrives via a visitor she did not summon, rendering her agency irrelevant to the outcome. Her attribute of being "observant" frames the narrative voice but fails to drive the plot or unlock the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation—to erase a specific moment of guilt—is compelling and clearly anchors the narrative. However, the pivotal realization is delivered through internal summary ("Elara understood then: the lab wasn’t a prison. It was a ledger") rather than relying solely on the dramatized action of tending to the child, which slightly distances the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lior is distinct and the internal drive for meaning is clear, but his "socially perceptive" trait feels misapplied when used to analyze a stone rather than a person. The climax relies on him obeying the flake's command ("Interject now") rather than making a difficult, character-driven choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias is a consistent, if archetypal, protagonist, but the antagonist (the Commander) functions as a narrative device rather than a character. His rapid conversion from murderous enforcer to grieving father—triggered by a single sentence—feels unearned and lacks the requisite internal friction or resistance for a high-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lydia is realized with distinct, albeit theatrical, interiority, but Elias functions merely as a prop for her intervention rather than a fully agentic character. His transformation from suicidal despair to hope occurs without on-page struggle or dialogue, rendering the emotional arc mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's established trait of "skepticism" is discarded too easily when the inciting incident occurs; she follows the somatic instructions "without thinking," missing an opportunity for internal conflict or a stronger earned decision. The motivation to find Mira is clear, but the lack of hesitation in using a mysterious, unverified object flattens the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lior's motivation ("rebellion") is stated but lacks on-page friction; the choice to reject the stasis pods feels inevitable rather than earned against a temptation to safety. The reliance on the wrist display to "tell" emotions ("fear spiked violet," "curiosity bloomed gold") externalizes interiority, bypassing visceral, embodied reaction. The character observes more than they struggle, making the final assumption of the "voice" role feel low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias is defined by his burden, but his pivotal moment—the decoding of the pattern—relies on an external magical prompt ("the code rearranged itself") rather than his own intellect or agency. The realization feels diagnostic rather than earned through struggle. While his motivation is clear, the lack of an internal tug-of-war weakens the character's depth.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s internal conflict—safety versus the compulsion to complete the mission—is well-dramatized through the "unused courage" motif. The "burned spy" archetype is executed with specific, embodied detail (tracing bark, the burned face). A minor slip into abstract labeling ("Prudence whispered no; daring hissed yes") distances the interiority slightly at the pivot point, but the final choice to leave the pillbox earns the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coachman and girl function effectively as atmospheric archetypes, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the girl's sudden insight regarding the needle lacks on-page causality, appearing as unearned magical intuition rather than a dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a thematic vessel defined by abstract labels ("phototropic to kindness") rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. He experiences no internal contradiction or struggle, moving through a ritualistic sequence where wisdom is granted by the narrator rather than earned through on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motivation is clearly drawn through her action, and the interaction with Elias provides a genuine crucible for her internal shift. However, the backstory reliance on a vague "war" and metaphors like the "rusted latch of her heart" feel slightly stock for interiority, relying on shorthand rather than specific lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lior is a distinct presence with a clear internal struggle, but his pivotal realization is delivered via an external magical object (the appearing book) rather than earned through internal conflict or agency. The reincarnation backstory feels asserted ("three lifetimes") rather than demonstrated through behavior or specific memory-beats that pressure the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora is a distinct presence with a clear backstory, but her internal conflict is resolved too smoothly. Her hesitation to release the spiral is brief and overcome by a single line of dialogue from the artist, lacking the visceral "contradictory impulses" or struggle required for higher bands. She acts as a willing vessel for the theme rather than a character fighting a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motivation to prove the signal's intent drives the narrative effectively, creating a proactive protagonist. However, the emotional interiority relies on label-like phrasing ("cautiously hopeful heart") rather than embodied reaction, and the character's specific history as an interpreter feels slightly generic beyond technical competence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a competent, genre-appropriate protagonist with a clearly defined phobia (claustrophobia) that adds friction to the descent. While his motivation ("the need") starts abstractly, the emotional connection to his father’s legacy grounds it effectively. The internal struggle is resolved somewhat linearly through willpower rather than a complex trade-off, but his final choice to "remake" rather than just "open" reveals character.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a superbly realized protagonist; his face-blindness is not merely a label but a sensory filter that defines his interaction with the world (texture, sound, thermal resonance). The internal arc from suppressed empathy to accepting the burden of "witness" is effectively dramatized through the specific memory of the dancer.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct, active protagonist whose specific expertise as a map librarian credibly drives the discovery and decoding process. His internal conflict—fear of the storm versus the "knowing" of his heritage—is well-dramatized, though the final pivot to burning the journal feels slightly rushed in its emotional processing. The "coward vs. brave" arc lands with a clear internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias lacks sufficient internal resistance or conflicting desires; his decision to leave reality feels inevitable rather than sculpted by struggle. The emotional cost of "unwriting" his life is asserted abstractly ("ashes of never") rather than felt through a dramatized trade-off of what he leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, contemplative focalizer, though his interiority relies heavily on summary labels like "reluctant philosopher" rather than purely dramatized struggle. While his motivation to understand his father's path is clear, the internal conflict feels slightly intellectualized, lacking visceral emotional cost until the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is largely passive; the central realization is delivered by an external voice ("You've been recording... but you forgot to listen") rather than earned through active struggle or choice. While the internal state is described, the emotional pivot relies on divine intervention rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eldrin is a sharply defined focalizer whose role as a "finder" rather than a healer drives the plot and theme. The internal arc—from a rigid refusal to bend to being "unbent" by the weight of truth—is executed with clear causality and emotional logic. The choice to pocket the key without using it demonstrates agency through restraint, earning the character's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    Liora functions as a vessel for the story's high-concept imagery rather than a grounded protagonist; her internal conflict is conveyed through abstract metaphors ("maps to a dream") instead of embodied reaction. The dialogue with her future self is purely expositional, reducing a potential high-stakes confrontation to a mechanism for delivering the story's moral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's motivation is clear and compels a high-stakes choice on the page. While the "holes in her soul" phrasing feels slightly stock for interiority, the specific trade of the child's name provides a painful, character-defining anchor that elevates the arc beyond the melodramatic setup.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liam is a coherent focalizer with a distinct worldview, but his interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("confidently uncertain," "insulating emotionally") rather than purely dramatized psychology. The emotional resolution feels slightly rushed, triggered by a convenient object rather than an arduous choice or interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal conflict regarding the "spirit" and grief is well-rendered, with a satisfying shift from external haunting to internal hypothesis. Elias's competence as a translator grounds the magical elements, though the wife remains somewhat idealized as a reward rather than a complex agent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct presence, grounded by the physical toll of the moon on his "titan-gear" physiology, which creates embodied cost. However, the woman functions primarily as a thematic cipher rather than a fully realized agent, and the dialogue leans heavily into stylized aphorism ("Almost is a kind of arrival") rather than organic interaction. The final refusal to log her name provides a solid character beat that defines his role.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The inspector functions primarily as a vessel for the story's thematic delivery rather than a fully realized character. Her internal state is described through generic physical markers ("fingers trembled," "hesitation") and her transition from inspector to radiant savior feels instantaneous and unearned by struggle. The decision to wear the pearl comes without genuine conflicting impulses or specific psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s identity as a "river chronicler" creates a distinct, meaningful lens for the conflict, grounding his guilt in his trade. The choice to stop medication establishes credible vulnerability, and the final decision to "turn right" (accepting the graffiti's designation of sorrow) provides a sharp, earned character beat that resolves the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's arc from passive observer to active participant is compelling and structurally sound. Her internal shift—realizing the watch is a thief rather than a gift—drives a decisive change in behavior that feels earned. The "veiled dreamer" archetype is grounded by specific, consequential choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is sharply defined and contradictory (financial freedom vs. ethical burden), driving a high-stakes choice. Elara's internal state is rendered with specific, embodied detail ("sloshed against the sides of her mind"), and the final renunciation of safety is earned by the on-page pressure from her specific ability.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear professional duality (beautician/mortician) that informs her worldview. However, her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("echo of a choice never made") rather than specific, grounded emotion, and the attribute "lucidly watchful" is delivered as a narrator tell rather than demonstrated through difficult observation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Maren is a deeply embodied protagonist whose internal contradictions (forgiving yet hollow) drive the narrative. The choice to reject "peace" for "the source" is a high-agency moment that defines her character, and the final act of giving the fruit is a earned gesture of "kindly decisive" power. The emotional cost of her history is palpable without being melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct presence, and his internal pivot is legible. However, the shift from twenty years of rigid certainty to total acceptance of nuance feels rushed and reactive to the prop rather than internally driven. The "sincerely insincere" trait acts as a label rather than a dramatized behavior in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist is vividly realized, with interiority that effectively bridges his physical sensation and metaphysical state. The &quot;sage&quot; archetype is executed with specific, embodied details (the &quot;roots settling into stone,&quot; the &quot;ache in his left hip&quot;), though the internal conflict remains somewhat muted as he maintains high control throughout the trance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is competent but static, functioning more as a vessel for lore than a living character with contradictory impulses. While the motivation to master the "old way" is clear, the lack of internal conflict or struggle diminishes the stakes. The emotional landscape is generic, relying on stated feelings ("breath hitched") rather than embodied complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlin’s motivation is clear and consistent, anchored in his status as an outcast. The internal shift from shame to acceptance of his "unremarkable" nature is well-charted, though the interaction with the Keeper renders him somewhat passive in the story's middle beat. The final defiance is a strong, character-specific choice that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a compelling obsession that anchors the narrative. The shift from passive seeker to active creator is a strong arc, but the climax relies on the mysterious figure explicitly explaining his internal realization ("You’ve been hiding...") rather than Elias earning it solely through the pressure of the scene, which softens the character agency at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora is a functional, competent protagonist whose interiority aligns well with the cosmic stakes. However, her motivation feels somewhat predestined rather than forged in struggle; the "quietly enthusiastic" trait acts more as a label than a driver of difficult choices, and her acceptance of dissolution lacks a visceral sense of fear or conflicting desire.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetype, but the interiority relies heavily on exposition ("heart... torn out," "wanted to give them shapes") rather than dramatized struggle. The lack of active resistance to the "promise he couldn’t keep" makes the emotional arc feel static; his stoicism dampens the potential for internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias acts as a functional protagonist, but his traits rely heavily on labels ("lukewarm," "earnest") rather than dramatized complexity. The "fingers bled" moment serves as a cliché shortcut for effort, and he faces no agonizing choices that test his devotion beyond mere persistence. The transition from naive fool to successful hero feels unearned by internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s transformation relies on sentimental projection—specifically the ashes forming "hands"—rather than grounded psychological pressure. The internal conflict resolves too neatly via ritual, and the interiority often defaults to "label-speak" metaphors (e.g., "snow of a forgiveness") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s internal arc is muddled; the text claims she must lose "sentimentality" and that "wonder had no place" in the new world, yet her epiphany is an embrace of wonder and feeling. This contradiction confuses the emotional cost, as she seems to gain exactly what she feared losing. The "secretly sentimental" trait is told rather than dramatized through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is competent and consistent, but her internal landscape relies heavily on labeled traits ("pattern seeker," "watcher's burden") rather than dramatized struggle. Her fear is stated in exposition ("not from fear but from the burden") rather than embodied in a costly hesitation or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s motivation to avoid erasure is clear, and the split-mind dynamic creates immediate tension. However, the emotional climax relies on abstract summary ("glorious all of it") rather than embodied experience, and the transition from numbness to wholeness feels like a toggle switch rather than an earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is distinct and stylized, fitting the fable-like tone. Elias’s motivation—preferring the "stretch" of failure over success—is compelling and clearly dramatized in his reaction to the seed. Lina serves as an effective catalyst, though her intuitive receptivity borders on the "magical archetype," making her feel slightly more like a plot device than a fully realized individual.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a compelling figure with a distinct internal landscape, though the shift from a mythic tunnel-dweller to "Uncle Elias" is slightly abrupt and risks grounding the fable-like tone too sharply. The emotional pivot from obsession to acceptance is earned, but the family's immediate, frictionless reintegration of him feels a bit tidy given the established isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyssa's internal conflict between duty (guardian) and desire (release) is well-dramatized through her physical state ("teeth ached") and the "homesick" books. The transition from fear to acceptance is earned by her relationship with uncertainty, which is established as her "only friend." The "feral" aspect is successfully internalized as sleepless exhaustion and physical closeness to the roots.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is grounded in a clear internal struggle, effectively turning the "unproductive obsession" into a solution. However, the transition to "stoic sensitivity" feels like a label applied after the magical fix rather than an earned emotional evolution, and the erasure of his scars removes the physical evidence of his journey's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions primarily as a thematic avatar for the concept of "unlearning," lacking distinct interiority or conflicting impulses beyond the central task. While her physical reactions ("breath hitched") ground the moment, her motivation remains abstractly philosophical rather than deeply personal or emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira is a competent, distinct voice, but she lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle; her "cool operator" persona ("fear was a luxury") flattens the dramatic tension as she faces no significant character-testing choices or failures.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear, melancholic vocation, but the cost of his sacrifice is muddied by the ending. The "reforming" thread suggests a renewable resource rather than a permanent loss of the mother's memory, dampening the emotional weight of the "grief made tangible." His detachment ("Let them") minimizes the interpersonal friction with the woman, reducing the scene's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elira is a consistent focalizer with a clear desire, but her internal arc lacks friction; her role as a teacher renders her static, as she faces no genuine doubt or temptation to abandon her path. Kael functions primarily as a foil to elicit exposition rather than a character exerting meaningful interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.5)
    Motivation shifts from professional curiosity to personal revelation, but the protagonist's failure to recognize his own mother requires convenient amnesia. Embodiment relies on stock phrasing ("breath came shallow," "knees hit the stone") rather than specific sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias's motivation ("to stand by the unremembered") drives the plot but remains abstract, lacking a grounded personal stake or cost. The claustrophobia is stated as a trait ("pulse hammering," "distant scream") but dissolves conveniently when the plot requires him to focus, rather than forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena’s fixation on the “count” creates a distinct internal rhythm that grounds her motivation. The shift from bureaucratic anxiety to cosmic acceptance is earned through the established interiority, though the final emotional pivot feels slightly rapid given the depth of her initial fear.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    Veyra functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychologically specific individual; her compulsion ("translate it all") overrides survival without a distinct, on-page oscillation or complex choice. The "copper veins" serve as aesthetic markers and a final image but do not constrain her agency or drive the scene's central decision.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's transition from bitterness to accepting the "cosmic joke" is compelling and serves as the story's emotional engine, grounding the surreal transformation in character truth. The internal conflict is vivid, though the final pivot feels slightly accelerated by the compressed timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions as a fable archetype rather than a nuanced character; while her motivation to restore beauty is clear, it lacks personal specificity or internal contradiction. Her primary action—playing the shell—feels more like a functional plot mechanic than a difficult, character-defining choice with visible personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a sympathetic focalizer with clear motivation, but his self-definition ("Respectfully rebellious") in dialogue feels artificial and prompt-driven. Lira functions effectively as a foil, though her characterization relies somewhat on poetic labeling ("collected them like bruises") rather than active depth.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lior's interiority is consistent, but his primary conflict is resolved through a somewhat abstract metaphorical action ("singing" with hands) rather than a hard choice with visible cost. The silence is well-established, but the shift feels slightly predetermined by the encounter rather than forged by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias has a clear motivation (grief/loneliness), but his internal state is resolved through magical externalization rather than character choice or interpersonal friction. The trait "sanely eccentric" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through specific behavior or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to "vitalize" dreams is distinct, but her pivotal choice is muddled. She hesitates to return the dream to the static library, yet her command ("Stay") results in her doing exactly that—filing it in a "blank volume." The internal conflict (wild experience vs. archival order) dissolves into an action that contradicts her concluding epiphany about stories being "lived" rather than read.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is distinct with a clear drive, and the backstory regarding her mother effectively anchors her skill and motivation in the present moment. However, the internal conflict resolves somewhat smoothly; the decision to "open" feels inevitable rather than a struggle with genuine cost, and the "mother" beat feels slightly functional rather than viscerally complicating the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is vividly embodied, grounding the shift from academic curiosity to personal horror in specific sensations (the "crisp ache"). Elias’s choice to accept the painful weight of memory over a clean slate is well-earned and defines his character arc. The antagonist's sudden reveal as a "former friend" lacks prior setup, reducing the emotional impact of that specific relationship dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elspeth is a compelling focalizer, her specific habits (tracing spines, the mirror shard) grounding her authority effectively. Kael functions well as an apprentice archetype but lacks distinct agency until the final beats, relying heavily on Elspeth’s prompts to navigate the crisis. The emotional arc is clear, though Kael's transition from trembling to mastery feels slightly rushed given the short runway.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a strong, distinct focalizer whose specific "hunger to shape the unseen" effectively motivates the surreal journey, elevating him above a standard "wise elder" archetype. His internal landscape is vivid, though the cost of his final sacrifice is felt more as a plot requirement than a visceral, embodied consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's transition from "restorer" to "door" is a profound internal arc that justifies the external action. The specific trait "accumulating silence" effectively grounds his interaction with the supernatural, and the choice to unravel the net feels earned by his backstory as a failed mender.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is a competent focalizer with a clear, singular drive ("methodically curious"). However, the narrative lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear progression of discovery without doubt, struggle, or significant personal cost. The characterization relies on her professional role rather than embodied emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's transition from "untangling threads" to accepting a mystery she cannot solve is a strong, earned arc. Her internal conflict is palpable, and the choice to lie serves as a decisive renunciation of her analytic nature in favor of a heavier truth. The backstory of the sister, while brief, effectively grounds her intimacy with loss ("threshold she'd never crossed").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation—translating silence into code—is established early and drives the central conflict. The backstory of the grandmother is seamlessly integrated to ground the climax, turning a memory into a tactical tool (the bolt plate). The internal shift from curiosity to defensive rejection is sharp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.7)
    Liora’s defining trait ("warmly inquisitive") is asserted via exposition rather than demonstrated through high-stakes choices. Her journey is largely passive observation, with the final internal shift feeling more like a reaction to the environment than a result of character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias is internally consistent but fundamentally passive; his primary action is "surrender," which dissolves the struggle rather than dramatizing it. The connection to his father adds depth, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("hollows where grief pooled") rather than specific, embodied psychology under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—chasing infinite precision versus accepting transience—is successfully externalized through the library task. The shift from trying to "catch smoke" to painting "the space between breaths" is a distinct, earned reconfiguration of her worldview, driven by the scene's failure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.6)
    Liora is an active protagonist, but she lacks internal conflict; her curiosity acts as a skeleton key rather than a trait that creates genuine friction. Captain Veyra is a prop who abandons her antagonism instantly without leverage or cost, rendering the relational dynamic flat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in professional pride ("rhythm of repair") and personal loss (sister). However, the emotional core relies on genre-standard shorthand ("sister stolen by an eclipse") rather than specific, dramatized interpersonal history. The interiority is lyrical but slightly distancing, filtering grief through metaphors of clockwork rather than raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    Liora acts as a passive vessel for instructions rather than an agent of change; she obeys Kael immediately without skepticism or internal friction. The emotional journey from weary seeker to community builder is smoothed over by summary rather than earned through dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias functions effectively as a mythic archetype, fitting the fable-like tone. However, his internal pivot—abandoning a thirty-year vigil the moment the puppet head appears—relies on the convenient recognition of the lullaby rather than a graduated struggle or decision process. The emotional connection feels asserted ("He understood then") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Liora is a distinct, weary focalizer with grounded interiority. However, her pivotal empathetic choice—saving the girl—occurs in flashback, leaving the present timeline with a contemplative resolve ("One day, she would fix it") rather than active agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct, well-rendered protagonist whose professional expertise (polymer chemistry) convincingly filters his grief and perception of the physical world. The internal conflict between holding on (atonement/repair) and letting go (dissolution) is dramatized effectively through interaction with the chrysalis. The "epiphany" feels slightly accelerated, but the emotional logic holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.4)
    Liora functions as a static archetype (the wise artisan) rather than a character under pressure; she faces no resistance, hesitation, or internal contradiction. Her "choices" are pre-determined procedural steps ("she already knew," "always did") rather than tactics deployed against a difficulty, resulting in a flat trajectory without earned agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Characterization is grounded in vivid sensory interiority that defines Elias’s role effectively. However, his actions in the scene are largely procedural—executing a routine ritual—rather than making a high-pressure choice that tests his values in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora is a competent agent who drives the plot, but her internal landscape lacks friction; she fixes a decades-old social fracture without paying a personal price or facing genuine doubt. Elias functions more as a foil than a fully realized character, offering token resistance that evaporates instantly upon receiving the object. The attribute "empathetically decisive" is inserted as a tell-y tag rather than dramatized through difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s internal conflict between her engineer’s precision and her desire for connection is well-dramatized through her interaction with the technology. Her motivation is clear, though the backstory of the lover ("too precise to be human") feels slightly stock. The final choice to "unfold" is an earned shift in identity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lysara’s motivation (grief) is clear and drives the scene, but her internal landscape is largely summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "prism-mind" trait is a compelling lens, but her single-mindedness lacks the friction of competing desires necessary for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias displays strong, perception-based interiority that fits the concept. However, the explicit labeling of his nature ("symphonically minded") and the thematic thesis ("Empathy in motion") flattens the subtext, telling the reader how to interpret him rather than letting the specific actions speak entirely for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    Elias is defined by his archetype (sad exile) rather than contradictory impulses or specific internal friction. The girl functions as a thematic device to prompt exposition rather than a distinct character; she lacks child-like interiority or limitation, speaking in the same elevated register as the tutor.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, consistent focalizer, but his pivotal shift—from passive observer to active participant—relies heavily on summarized realization ("Elias realized it wasn’t just...") rather than a dramatized struggle or difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s sensory-driven interiority and motivation are distinct and compelling, grounding the narrative effectively. However, her victory in the climax comes too easily; the Elders' immediate acceptance of her journal deprives her of a defining, high-stakes choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Veyra functions as a generic vehicle for the plot rather than a distinct individual; her interiority relies on stock reactions ("breath hitched") and abstract motivation ("find the source of resilience") without personal, contradictory stakes. The ending transformation is accepted without the internal friction or fear that would make the character feel human.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Veyra is a competent focalizer with clear motivation rooted in past trauma. However, the "patch itching" as a somatic signal for intuition is a pulp cliché that detracts from the otherwise grounded psychological portrayal of her PTSD and professional caution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora is a functional protagonist whose synesthesia grounds the fantasy, but she lacks internal friction; her choice to rebel feels pre-decided rather than struggled for. The phrase "synesthetically blessed" reads as a clinical label rather than embodied experience, slightly distancing the reader from her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias shows clear internal conflict between his duty as a guardian and his realization of failure. However, his shift from defender to explorer relies heavily on a sudden epiphany ("some doors were meant to open") rather than a dramatized struggle, making the transformation feel slightly rushed and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a compelling, specific protagonist whose arc from detached collector to vulnerable vessel is executed with precision. The "borrowing" trait is not just a quirk but the engine of his internal conflict, and his final surrender is a decisive, character-defining choice with a felt cost—the loss of his control and identity as the "printer." The emotional progression from the widow’s borrowed grief to his own raw exposure is distinct and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist relies on stock somatic responses ("trembled," "heart hammering," "breath hitched") rather than specific, embodied interiority. His transformation from anxiety to confident successor is driven by the woman's explanation rather than a hard-won internal struggle or choice. The epiphany ("he understood") feels unearned by the preceding action, relying on a sudden cognitive leap rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with a specific worldview ("measured silence in degrees") that colors his narration. His arc from seeking validation to rejecting the "proof" is a clear, earned reversal. The moment of realization relies slightly on a sudden vision rather than active deduction, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as a fable archetype rather than a fully realized character; her motivation is clear (longing), but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. The sacrifice—giving her life for the message—is decided instantly, minimizing the dramatic weight of the choice on the page. The lover appears only as a recipient, lacking distinct interiority beyond mirroring her action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype who fits the prompt's "meek but determined" mold, but he lacks idiosyncratic interiority or genuine internal friction. The transition from trembling hands to "edges sharp enough to cut" feels unearned by the brief, low-stakes action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora is defined primarily by her sensory ability rather than a distinct personality or flawed agency. Her internal realization ("truth wasn't a place, but a choice") feels like a convenient authorial pivot rather than a character-driven decision earned through struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct, stoic archetype whose internal shift—from rigid isolation to communal acceptance—is legible. However, the pivot from burning letters to fully accepting the supernatural connection feels slightly frictionless, lacking the internal resistance or doubt that would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora functions more as a mythic archetype than a grounded character; the "laughter as a weapon" trait is asserted via narration rather than dramatized through specific interactions or consequences. Her loss of control with the prophecy offers a glimpse of interiority, but her subsequent return to routine lacks emotional cost or processing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is largely reactive, following the instructions of the donor heart, the mysterious woman, and the map rather than driving events through difficult choices. The internal "ache" is stated but not dramatized into a high-stakes struggle until the summary climax. His agency is functional but lacks the friction of a distinct personality pushing back against destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a consistent, embodied protagonist whose sensitivity drives the narrative. However, he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his competence is absolute, and the emotional climax feels like a routine discharge of duty rather than a result of difficult, high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora is a functional archetype of the "last keeper," active but lacking deep internal contradiction or unexpected choices. Her struggle is physical ("fingers bled") rather than a complex moral dilemma; her release at the end feels more like a reward than a costly sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is largely passive in the climax; the antagonist (Voss) explains her arc, guides her hand, and resolves the conflict for her. The trait "empathy was a curse" appears as diagnostic label-speak rather than a dramatized constraint that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora serves as a functional catalyst for the fable but lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she is certain from the start and faces no doubt. The specific prompt phrase "heuristically gentle" is used as a backstory label rather than a dramatized trait in the present, creating a "tell" that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a complex character; his motivation shifts instantly from dutiful archivist to romantic seeker via the "dream lover" trope, bypassing earned development. The attribute "gently meticulous" is stated but does not constrain his choices under pressure, and his internal conflict is resolved too easily by the convenient invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s voice is distinct and her motivation is clear, fitting the noir archetype well. However, she lacks vulnerability or internal conflict in the scene; her victory is efficient and cool, but devoid of the emotional cost or struggle required for higher emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira is established as a skeptic, but this trait dissolves instantly upon the inciting incident without struggle or interior negotiation. The transition from observer to "being the storm" lacks emotional friction; she accepts the ontological shift with a laugh rather than the resistance a true skeptic would manifest. The "impossible" moment feels unearned because the cost of abandoning her worldview is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's &quot;mnemonically gifted&quot; trait functions more as a plot device to operate the lock than a deeply embodied psychological constraint that shapes perception. The emotional climax relies on performative behaviors (&quot;scream,&quot; &quot;sob&quot;) rather than specific, internal complexity, making the epiphany feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is inextricably linked to a visceral physical constraint (wilting/pain) that drives the plot. The internal conflict between professional duty (gilding) and physical necessity (truth) is dramatized effectively. The final choice to ignore the new summons in favor of private truth demonstrates a profound, earned shift in agency.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    Liora functions as an idealized archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or embodied flaws. She executes a ritual with perfect prescience ("She knew... the sound would be perfect"), which removes the potential for struggle or a meaningful micro-choice under pressure. Her muteness is atmospheric but does not force a tactical trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s internal conflict is compelling, driven by the "static" as a visceral symptom of repression. The pivot to destruction is well-motivated by the backstory, though the personification of the fears in the box ("squirmed... with recognition") leans slightly into sentimental abstraction rather than grounded character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira functions as a narrative device rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct flaws, or resistance to the supernatural elements. Her immediate acceptance of the "hum" and the crowd's demands creates a friction-free arc where she faces no genuine dilemma or personal cost. The emotional progression is smooth to the point of flatness, with no moment of doubt or struggle to ground the sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira is competent and her motivation (liberating/transforming secrets rather than stealing) is clear, but her internal arc feels slightly smooth. The shift in perspective relies on accepting the scientist's philosophy via backstory rather than a messy, on-page struggle or error, limiting the depth of the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's obsession is visceral, driving him past horror into a deeper, fatalistic resolve. The shift from "some things aren't meant to be found" to "he would find the ledger" effectively dramatizes the complex irrationality of grief, creating a strong Earned Stasis at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined solely by her role and solitude, lacking specific interiority or internal contradiction. Her emotions are stated ("solitude pressing in") rather than dramatized through distinct behavior, and the resolution feels like a default emotional reset rather than an earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivation is sharply defined and inextricably linked to the plot’s trap; Elias’s desire to understand his inheritance drives every beat. The transformation of the attribute "patiently nimble" from a physical trait to a grim metaphysical state ("patient as the dead, nimble as a lie") demonstrates excellent character arc integration through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora serves as a functional vehicle for the theme rather than a complex agent; her skepticism is summarized backstory ("had scoffed") rather than a live, contradictory impulse in the scene. Emotions are frequently labeled ("sorrow," "rage," "stubborn love") rather than embodied through behavior, and the transition from skeptic to believer lacks on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s internal motivation is clear and poignant, but the antagonist (the Emperor) pivots too easily from tyrant to student. The lack of friction in the Emperor's transformation—shifting to "Teach me" without significant on-page pressure or leverage—undercuts the emotional realism and reduces the climax to a convenient resolution rather than an earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Veyra’s motivation is sharp and drives the narrative effectively from start to finish. However, Kaelis functions more as an expository device than a fully realized antagonist; his dialogue leans heavily into explaining the magic system rather than dramatizing a personal conflict, which lowers the tension of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lena is a compelling focalizer; her motivation to "salvage" creates a strong internal crucible that mirrors the widow's external grief. The shared moment of vulnerability with the locket earns the emotional connection, though the widow’s pivot from resistance to acceptance feels slightly rushed for the weight of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael and Liora function clearly as mentor and student, but they serve the theme rather than driving the plot through deep internal pressure. While motivations are legible, the characters lack the contradictory impulses or high-stakes micro-choices that characterize the highest bands; the "passing of the torch" feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is distinct and the internal conflict between skepticism and pattern-recognition is engaging. However, a veteran debunker of "poisoned wells" eating radioactive fruit to "stave off nausea" creates a competence break that feels like a plot device rather than a character choice, and his conversion from skeptic to laughing believer is rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, compelling protagonist whose internal shift from "needle" to "hand" effectively dramatizes his reclamation of agency. His motivation is clear and urgent, though the transition from hermit to ruler feels slightly rapid for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is stated in exposition ("to become the translator") rather than revealed through struggle, and the pivotal internal shift ("Something inside Elias unclenched") relies on summary rather than dramatized decision-making. The emotional arc is complete but feels unearned, as the child's arrival resolves his conflict without him forcing a difficult choice or paying a visible price before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The engineer is active and competent, with agency driving the climax. However, the interiority relies on explicit labeling ("Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay") rather than embodied contradiction, which flattens the psychological nuance of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lior functions as a static archetype of "patience" rather than a complex character; his certainty leaves no room for doubt, internal conflict, or meaningful struggle. He pays no emotional price for his victory, as he is vindicated exactly as predicted without testing his beliefs. The "sister" memory is a brief expositional device that fails to ground his motivation in immediate relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's established trait ("watchfully calm," "safety analyst") is contradicted by the pivotal decision to smash his only light source against a potentially unstable wall. This action feels motivated by the author's need for a dramatic beat rather than the character's internal logic or training. The transition from analyst to rogue archivist is functional but lacks sufficient on-page interiority to earn the sudden shift in risk tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s internal state relies on abstract labels ("regrets," "sorrow," "relief") rather than singular, embodied psychological detail. The shift from guilt to resolution is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine hesitation or conflicting impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pip’s characterization effectively blends mechanical constraints with organic yearning ("spine of stolen bicycle chains," "curious heart"). Her motivation—the "yearning algorithm"—is dramatized through the physical cost she accepts (soldering new joints, losing limbs), creating a compelling portrait of obsessive creation. The internal conflict between the safety of the cliffside and the "vibration" of the fall is well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lena is a functional protagonist with a clear desire, but her internal life relies on stock physical markers ("breath hitched," "hands shook") rather than specific, embodied interiority. While the choice to join the archive is motivated, the emotional transition feels rushed, relying on the prop (patch) more than deep psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is a distinct, atmospheric focalizer, and his shift from observer to intervener is clear. However, the interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("space where doubt lived") rather than specific, grounded emotion, making him feel slightly archetypal rather than deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's shift from seeking euthanasia to embracing life hinges on a sentimental prop reveal rather than a hard-won internal struggle. While the "loose grip on reality" trait effectively motivates the ice walk, the psychological pivot feels unearned and lacks the visceral cost required for this subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lior functions as a vessel for melancholy rather than an agent; his "sentinel" role is stated but his choices are limited to passive reminiscence. Interiority relies on poetic metaphor ("loneliness feel like a second skin") rather than embodied emotion, resulting in a performed rather than felt internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysan’s motivation is distinctly drawn and drives the action; her choice to accept the transience of her task ("hold it long enough") earns the emotional beat. The internal stance of "strangely honest" frames the narrative effectively, showing character growth through the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist is an archetype rather than a character, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her emotional state is static ("calm," "chest didn't ache"), and she encounters no personal stakes or difficult choices that would reveal depth beyond her functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation ("decode the sequence") and grounded interiority. However, the transformation ("reticent no longer") feels slightly rushed; the shift from isolation to connection relies heavily on the sudden arrival of the second character rather than a fully dramatized internal struggle or decision prior to that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias is a distinct, atmospheric protagonist whose internal conflict—the burden of prophecy versus the need for release—drives the narrative. The climax features a strong assertion of agency (running toward the fear) and the "precognitively forgetful" trait is effectively dramatized in the sensory details of the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias functions more as an archetype ("sage of broken things") than a fully realized character. His internal transition from repairman to mystic relies on "diagnostic label-speak" ("he called it a question") rather than embodied psychological struggle. The pivotal epiphany is instantaneous upon touching the clock, lacking the friction of a genuine internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lena is defined by her role and poetic interiority rather than high-stakes choices. The attribute "decisively kind" is stated but translates on page to standard compassionate care; the cost of her kindness is described in metaphors ("biting," "betrayal") rather than dramatized through friction or sacrifice. The emotional arc feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s motivation tracks, but her emotional reaction to the climax is underdeveloped. When warned of a horrific fate ("becoming the first shadow"), she accepts it instantly ("Good... Then I won't be alone") without prior establishment of desperate loneliness or obsession, making the stakes feel weightless. The shift from "quiet deliberation" to a "kick in the door" action-hero attitude in the final lines creates a jagged inconsistency in character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora is drawn with distinct interiority ("forgiving skeptic"), and the bone-setting skill effectively frames her agency. However, her competence is nearly absolute; she faces the antagonist and succeeds without significant internal struggle or a difficult micro-choice that forces a trade-off, making her victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora functions more as a thematic archetype (the Wise Keeper) than a fleshed-out character; she lacks internal contradiction or genuine temptation to deviate from her path. Her emotional calibration is too perfect—she immediately accepts the child with profound wisdom—which robs the scene of interpersonal friction or reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s internal landscape is rendered with embodied precision, moving from defensive withdrawal to active growth. The decision to relinquish the pendant is a high-stakes psychological micro-choice that pays a visible cost—her grandmother’s protection—to earn a new state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias functions as a "tortured artist" archetype rather than a specific individual; his transition from resistance to self-dissolution feels driven by romantic myth rather than psychological continuity. The internal struggle is stated ("voices in his head") more than dramatized through distinct behavior, making the surrender feel like a predetermined beat rather than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Character motivation is clear but lacks the friction of genuine struggle; the transition from tinkerer to singer is achieved through summary rather than a dramatized choice with visible alternatives. Mira's internal conflict is stated ("stories were safer") but not felt through contradictory impulses in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype ("The Alchemist") lacking internal contradiction or contradictory impulses. She acts as a perfect vessel for the theme without struggling against a competing desire or flaw, making her choices feel inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's motivation relies on a sentimental construct ("wonder," "daughter's laughter") that feels more like a thematic device than a visceral human drive. The daughter functions as a prop to generate poignancy rather than a character exerting active pressure. The internal monologue is consistent but leans heavily on abstract emotional concepts rather than grounded desire.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira's internal landscape is vivid, and her shift from active purger to passive vessel ("I am the loom") creates a meaningful arc. Her motivation to relieve burdens is palpable, though the "fractal weaver" identity feels like a label disconnected from the lamp-based mechanics shown.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation to process grief through craft is clear and sustained. The internal shift from "containing" the husband to accepting his absence is legible, though the pivotal realization feels slightly unearned by the immediate scene pressure, relying instead on a dream.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is deep and economical; the protagonist's internal struggle is effectively externalized through the "ghost" and the lagoon's manifestations. The contradiction between her stated intent ("not here to go back") and her final surrender ("let the past have her") creates a complex, earned ambiguity rooted in trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lena is a distinct, capable protagonist whose "functional creativity" drives the plot; her choice to repurpose rather than restore shows strong agency. Her internal monologue occasionally drifts into abstract theming rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader slightly from her immediate state.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict is clear, and the shift from paralysis to rebellion is dramatized through physical action. However, the inciting pivot relies heavily on the sensory trigger ("petrichor nostalgia") rather than a cumulative causal pressure, making the sudden defiance of years of dogma feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's internal conflict is legible, and the final renunciation (dropping the ledger) is a solid character beat with visible cost. However, her epiphany relies heavily on "label-speak" ("architecture of lies") and a magical prop interaction rather than a pure pressure-driven psychological breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character with contradictory impulses; his patience is a label ("infinitely patient") rather than a dramatized struggle. There is no internal conflict or hesitation during the decoding process, resulting in a frictionless execution that lacks emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a functional focalizer with clear interiority, but his actions (pressing thread to lips) feel performative rather than grounded in necessary behavior. The internal shift at the end feels summarized rather than earned through a high-pressure choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric’s yearning is palpable and his motivation to "reawaken beauty" drives every beat. His interiority effectively bridges the gap between the mechanical setting and his romantic desperation. While he fits the "lonely dreamer" archetype snugly, his acceptance of the "broken miracle" at the end demonstrates a character-specific shift in values.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora's internal landscape is rich but relies heavily on summary and backstory rather than behavior under pressure. The interaction with the boy feels staged to deliver a thematic lesson rather than an authentic human exchange; his reaction (laughter immediately after a deep cut) strains credibility. The "gracefully alert" trait appears as a label rather than an enacted mode of observation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora is drawn with sharp interiority, though the "luminous skeptic" label feels slightly contradictory to her immediate acceptance of the magical quest. The conflict with her younger self provides a moment of depth, but the dismissal of the warning is too swift to fully register as a high-stakes psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Veyra is a coherent focalizer with a clear desire that drives the narrative. However, her characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("sentimentalist") and familiar tropes rather than idiosyncratic behavior. The internal conflict is resolved somewhat too smoothly; the surrender of the memory feels more like a transaction than a visceral emotional loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is palpable, though the "scream he'd never let himself voice" relies on stock emotional shorthand. The emotional pivot from frustration to acceptance is earned through the "spectral mentorship," but the resolution relies heavily on the father's direct instruction rather than the carver's own agency or grit.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias is a deeply realized protagonist; his motivation (atonement via precision) is complex and drives the narrative logic. The internal conflict is embodied in the physical action of carving and weighting the clock, creating a strong unity of character and plot. The final stance is a powerful Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias is a distinct, grounded protagonist whose arc from "blithe" to "deepened" is successfully dramatized through action. His reaction to the supernatural ("hands didn't shake") establishes competence, though it slightly muffles the visceral terror of the climax. The internal shift is earned and visibly alters his final interaction with the chessboard.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora is a competent functionary of the plot rather than a character under pressure. While her motivation is clear, she faces no internal contradiction or genuine crucible; she arrives, performs her skill without failure, and leaves. The lack of a difficult choice or personal cost renders her emotional arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a distinct, coherent focalizer, and his background as a copyist effectively grounds his resistance. However, his internal struggle is minimal; his commitment to the cause is static from the start, lacking a dramatized moment of doubt or conflicting impulse to heighten the final choice. Lira functions more as a symbolic catalyst than a fully realized character with distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora’s internal landscape is coherent, and the physical cost of the mask (shards pressing into temples) effectively grounds her artistic philosophy in bodily sensation. However, her interiority occasionally drifts into aphoristic performance rather than organic thought ("Understanding was the enemy of art"), making her feel slightly more like a thematic vessel than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is a distinct, internalized protagonist whose transition from survivor to martyr is earned by the "siege" pressure. The "not a philosopher" denial clashes slightly with his deeply philosophical interiority, but his final choice to "witness" rather than flee demonstrates values foreclosing survival with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a strongly realized focal point, his internal landscape of loss rendered with specificity ("tracing the carved edges"). The supporting cast, while functionally distinct, relies on trauma-shorthand ("bullet-scarred folder," "tremor") that leans toward archetypal efficiency rather than deep characterization. The emotional logic of their return is sound, and the collective shift from singing to humming feels earned by their shared fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is a distinct presence with grounded sensory interiority, but his transformation relies heavily on the magical fruit rather than active psychological struggle. The sudden "understanding" bypasses the hard work of character change, resolving his internal conflict via ingestion rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a distinct presence, but his defining "truth" trait feels ornamental, appearing mainly to justify the final line rather than constraining his choices during the climb. The internal conflict ("You're afraid it won't work") is resolved too easily to generate significant character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Liora serves as a functional vessel for the atmosphere but lacks high-stakes agency or deep internal contradiction. Her motivation is stated in exposition ("That was what she was chasing") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance. The character observes rather than drives the scene until the final ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora is a compelling, distinct focalizer with a voice that merges geology and consciousness ("mind a silent hum against the crushing dark"). However, the human intruder functions primarily as a reactive prop, capitulating to Liora's telepathy with standard somatic beats ("breath hitched," "knees hit") rather than active resistance. The intruder's rapid conversion from assassin to martyr feels slightly mechanical, driven by the plot's need for the "three truths" structure rather than a complex internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s characterization as a "grim optimist" is effectively dramatized by her final choice to reject the easy exit in favor of the meaningful struggle. The decision to keep the chipped die and abandon the smooth one perfectly aligns her internal traits with her external action, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's internal state is lyrical but distant; the physical toll of "forty-three nights" is stated but negated by his "steady" hands, reducing the visceral stakes. Motivation is clear but delivered through abstract summary ("chasing the idea") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora functions primarily as a plot device to facilitate the magical resolution rather than a fully realized character. She lacks internal contradiction or resistance; upon seeing the vision, she accepts the supernatural logic and destroys her heirloom without a moment of dramatized doubt or struggle. The emotional weight of destroying her grandmother's legacy is skipped in favor of plot advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias is a compelling archetype of obsession, his internal landscape perfectly mirrored by the mechanical surrealism of the plot. While his singular drive lacks deep interpersonal nuance or vulnerability, his choice to "unmake" creates a distinct, legible arc of renunciation that anchors the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal state (the "curse" of the negative) is compelling and consistent, but his motivation is largely reactive to the advisor's instructions. The final "wink" feels tonally jarring and slightly unearned given the somber introspection that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Leeward is a compelling, highly specific protagonist whose internal motivation (turning resistance to rhythm) perfectly drives the physical action. His history with the "split mast" and the sailors' curse effectively grounds his competence and risk profile. The shift from fear to the "thrill of the next note" provides a clear emotional arc within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elyas is a competent focalizer whose specialized skill set drives the plot, and his motivation is clear. However, his progression lacks internal friction or doubt; he solves the mystery with linear efficiency, resulting in a departure that feels more like a scheduled ascension than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "emotionally rational" trait is explicitly told rather than organically shown, and immediately undercut by standard physiological reactions ("pulse betrayed him"). While his motivation is clear, he functions more as a thematic vehicle than a nuanced individual.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, internalized protagonist whose grief is dramatized through his interaction with the ruins. While the attribute "stoically sensitive" is delivered via exposition rather than action, his choice to reply to the note and trade the inkwell effectively demonstrates his motivation. The internal conflict between his technical role and poetic nature drives the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined largely by labels ("tranquilly perceptive," "logical") rather than choices made under pressure. His reaction to a reality-breaking discovery—finding his own life scripted in a book—is implausibly flat ("his hands didn't tremble"), missing the opportunity for genuine internal conflict or visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and anchored in a specific grief that drives the central action. The physical cost of the magic—pain rewriting her skin—is visceral and well-dramatized. While the daughter serves as a slightly archetypal motivator, the lantern maker’s final choice to surrender to the recording feels earned by the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lena’s agency drives every beat; she transforms from victim to active "perturbation" through a sequence of high-stakes choices. The internal arc—refusing to fix the past in favor of witnessing its potential—is sophisticated and earns the emotional shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lena’s motivation (“hunger to decode the frequency of belonging”) is articulated through abstract interiority rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The immediate emotional pivot from theft to profound spiritual connection with a stranger feels unearned and skips necessary relational friction. The "perpetually surprised" trait appears as a label without constraining her behavior or creating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist with a compelling profession and clear internal conflict (penance vs. concealment). His guilt is palpable and embodied in his actions. However, the emotional arc relies slightly on summarized backstory ("told himself for seven years") rather than fully dramatized present-moment struggle before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions as a static archetype of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; his internal state is delivered through "told" thematic summaries ("man who untethered stalemates") rather than conflicted micro-choices. Kaelis’s pivot relies on a convenient, unseeded backstory connection to the prop rather than a dramatized shift in her Ruthless persona.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s internal conflict—flight versus staying—is well-dramatized through the compass and the poles. His motivation is clear and shifts logically, though the daughter's letter serves as a slightly convenient external conscience that explicitly diagnoses his flaw ("ghost with a paddle").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liam’s internal conflict—erasure versus ownership of his past—is fleshed out through concrete details like the "hollow behind his ribs." The choice to throw the baseball is a strong, active moment of renunciation that earns the shift in his trajectory. The ambiguity regarding the "man he'd become" slightly blurs the specific nature of the antagonist, but the emotional logic holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s motivation is visceral and consistent, driven by a grief that overrides her knowledge of the natural order. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her refusal to heed the warnings of the stag and the fortune until the climax. The final shift to acceptance ("she didn't fight it") feels earned by the failure of her active attempts, representing a resonant reconfiguration of her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora is a distinct, evocative protagonist, and her internal state—hoarding grief like a miser—is dramatized effectively through the ritual. The pivot to acceptance is slightly rapid, relying on the brother's apparition to catalyze the change rather than a strictly internal realization, but the emotional logic holds. The "willingly perplexed" trait is stated directly but supported by her devotion to the riddle of the saucer.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lien is a compelling, mythic figure whose physical lightness serves as a strong metaphor for grief's release. However, she lacks deep internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her steadfast determination makes her somewhat singular in dimension. The transition from "last" to "first" human offers a satisfying conceptual arc.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira functions as a thematic vessel rather than a conflicted agent; her motivation ("texture of transformation") is abstract and lacks visceral grounding. She faces no internal opposition, and her "sacrifice" of the bugs is met with laughter rather than hesitation or felt cost, flattening the emotional arc. The trait of "orchestrating coincidences" is told rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael displays high competence but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; the execution of the heist is smooth and devoid of genuine struggle or error. His motivation is established via summary ("Kael had read them all") rather than dramatized through a pressure-filled choice on the page. While the renunciation of his post is a decisive act, the lack of hesitation or felt cost makes him read more as an archetype than a complex character.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora is a distinct presence, but her pivotal climatic action is undermined by a loss of agency ("hands moved without thought") and reliance on an external, disembodied voice to direct her. The shift from herder to dust-weaver feels imposed rather than driven by internal character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with clear motivation, but his characterization relies heavily on "tortured poet" archetypes (ink-stained fingers, silenced verses, scars on wrists). While the internal conflict is legible, the emotional expression feels performed rather than embodied, leaning on romanticized signals of grief rather than specific, individualized reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character voices are distinct and the shift from rivalry to partnership is motivated by the shared frustration of the wait. However, Liora's twelve-year withholding of the secret makes the sudden revelation feel slightly convenient for the scene's timeframe, and Elias's mechanical arm serves more as a prop than a driver of deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Motivations are clear, but the internal conflict ("the itch" to leave vs. the desire to stay) resolves too easily via sentimental cues (the flower) rather than a hard choice with visible cost. Dialogue leans into aphorisms ("bloom in the dark") rather than naturalistic interaction, making the emotional connection feel performative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is clear (reunion), but the character lacks internal conflict; her journey is a linear execution of a plan without emotional doubt or contradictory impulses. The "steely longing" is stated via simile rather than dramatized through friction or resistance in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora’s motivation is clear, but her emotional arc resolves too smoothly into transcendent acceptance ("Liora laughed"), undercutting the established terror of the sacrifice. The shift from fearful guardian to mythic entity feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is a distinct presence with grounded interiority, but his emotional arc is largely reactive to the magical object rather than driven by difficult active choices. The transition from deep grief to feeling "lighter" is smoothed over by the compass's influence, lacking the grit of a struggle where he must confront the "unsaid" without a supernatural crutch.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivation rooted in obsession with silences drives endurance to dissolution, embodied in "fingers tracing the flaking gold leaf"; minor slip in absent simultaneous contradictory impulses during retelling, but micro-choices like page-turning reveal values under self-erasure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong embodied interiority via servos and core temperature drop amid dissonance, with micro-choices like picking up the violin revealing values under pressure; final remembering earned by prior glitches and whispers.

    Lena's motivation rooted in past box office mistrust drives micro-choices like pressing the lens and drawing the ticket; embodied emotions via warped skin lines show contradiction thawing.

    Vine dresser's motivation rooted in loving the garden "too openly, too strangely" compels her to lead elders to the marble shrine, earning a change with embodied cost in her "withered hands steady."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mechanic's motivation to prove time spills sideways drives consistent micro-choices like ignoring the AI and pulling the lever, with embodied details ("mechanically warm" hands) revealing expertise and blind spots.

Final endurance of his belief earns a credible shift without tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong embodied interiority and micro-choices under pressure, like the hesitant first dot stroke revealing predictive trust; motivation for innovation compels the mapping with felt numbness as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation to reclaim harmony through silences is rooted in concrete traits and intensifies via remnant arrivals; interiority particular via rosette as student's sigh.

Girl's question forces a final, non-burning truth that tests his trait without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander's lie ("I’m not here to fight") followed by lunge reveals contradictory impulses under pressure, earning the final clasp choice with visible cost in new hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leeward's drive to "dub" obstacles roots in traits like twitching at cloud-strings and leaning into sway; restlessness shifts to "thrill of the next note" via earned micro-choices, with embodied contradiction in laughing amid uncertainty.

    Elias's emotionally rational trait shows in non-panic response to the message and confrontation, with pulse betrayal adding contradiction; final papers reveal earned via prior codex chase.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong micro-choices reveal Elias's thoughtful hierarchy of values, as in offering the drawer pull to evoke personal connection over direct info trade.

Minor slip in abstract emotional summaries like "ghost of a sibling’s love" slightly dilutes embodied contradiction at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interior contradiction in the "merrily melancholic" laugh amid hesitation, with embodied compass warmth anchoring regret; final renunciation to stay earned by letter's embodied read on post office steps, showing hierarchy of values without tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liam's interior contradiction shines in the lake reflection showing past selves, compelling the throw as an earned renunciation of erasure with embodied cost (throat tightens). Micro-choices like flexing fingers and carrying the ball reveal values under pressure. Minor diagnostic echo in lake's voice ("Empathy isn’t something you get") slightly abstracts without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses act in scene—Liora's reluctance ("didn’t want to believe it") clashes with twitching fingers and snapping at the moon—earning her final metamorphosis as bridge with brother's warning as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses act in scene via reaching through mist despite knowing better, earning final renunciation; interiority concrete (breath hitched, throat tightened) with embodied grief; brother's pressure forces micro-choice to repent, foreclosing hoarded loss with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority via embodied lightness ("body hummed, lighter than it should have been") tied to grief's lift, with contradictory fear of light vs. persistent stitching compelling the final push; final choice to step through earned by 300 years of failures, foreclosing isolation with relational gain.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's motivation to understand transformation drives micro-choices like uncorking the vial and hurling bottles, rooted in her philanthropic trait and accidental orchestration; interiority embodied in "breath hitched" and "laughed, sharp and bright."

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation from ledgers roots steady defiance, embodied in "lips twitched" and micro-choices like precise picks under alarm risk; competence balanced by genuine struggle in "one wrong twist."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (answers vs. destinations) act in the duel, earning the partnership choice; mechanical arm sparks reveal Elias under pressure. Interiority concrete (pulse quickens at coded overture). Final grip meets callouses/brass as visible relational reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Embodied itch as contradictory impulse (leave vs mend) drives micro-choices like tin addition and violet tuck, earning relational stasis; Maren's steady hands apply crucible pressure without stereotypes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist of cosmic collapse who now studies terrestrial decay—is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to sprinkle dust rather than “save” the orchids crystallizes his shift. Emotional layering is credible: the vial becomes both relic and instrument, never reduced to label-speak. The final renunciation (sabbatical email) carries visible cost: he forfeits institutional identity for listening. Still, the arc is lightly sketched; one more pressured beat that forced him to defend the dust-method against a live skeptic would have deepened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s contradictory drives—grief for her lost art vs. need to confront her brother’s guilt—are palpable in her micro-choice to release the ledger. Interiority stays concrete (“ash in her lungs”), but the epiphany that “truth, like glass, is clearer when broken” drifts toward aphorism. Adaptive trait is shown when frost replaces glass as her medium of pattern-seeking. The renunciation costs feel scaled to a 700-word arc: she forfeits both the ledger and the illusion of rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—grief for the lost crew vs. the need to make silence speak—are dramatized through embodied action (bleeding fingers, breath rhythm) rather than labels. The micro-choice to bleed onto the keys to thaw sound is earned by the heat-map foreshadowing and carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete: “salt in her veins,” not abstract therapy-speak. The Earned Stasis of walking back into the storm with the case forecloses safety and is scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s quiet, salt-cracked stubbornness is shown through every action—cataloguing the drowned, swimming against the current, climbing the lighthouse ribs—so the final act of adding his own name to the ledger feels inevitable. Interiority stays concrete: “the warmth of a held breath,” “edges biting through his coat like teeth.” The only flaw is a trace of diagnostic self-awareness in “he finally understood: rest wasn’t the absence of movement,” but the embodied cost of the climb and the lens’s disintegration keeps the moment earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reluctant leadership, calloused hands cradling the bell, and refusal to let hunger define legacy are rendered through embodied micro-choices. The internal contradiction—anonymity vs. recognition—peaks when he keeps Liora’s note inside the bell, a silent admission that costs him perfect secrecy. Every food-run beat sharpens his traits; the final renunciation of ringing lets the wind take over, sealing earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s obsession with half-seen images and the jade’s pull feel lived-in; the physician memory arrives as a full-force revelation that re-codes his guilt. Micro-choice—pressing the stone to his sternum—marries need and risk in one motion. The laugh at the end is credible release after visible cost: the jade vanishes, his ribcage now literally carries her weight. Interiority stays concrete (“breath formed shapes…then dissolved”) without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulse—destroying the maze to escape its temporal snare—drives every beat; the embodied ache in her palm as she clenches the halo fragment makes the cost visceral. The final laugh while feeling the “grain of time” crystallizes her earned shift from solver to edge-designer, foreclosing the old path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—her thumb tracing the key, the whispered mantra, the deliberate scattering of seeds—each micro-choice embodies her contradictory impulse to sow chaos and order. The six-year cell memory and “chained liberator” tag are shown through embodied patience rather than exposition. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A. Flaw and cost are legible: she arms the soil with life while risking capture, the dirt-stained hands the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his nightly return to the greenhouse, the haptic memory of scars hissing against cooling copper—but his motives (“absences,” “trust breaking”) remain abstract. The contradiction between clinical day-job precision and messy nocturnal imprints is sharp, yet the stakes of losing/renaming trust never tighten into a single, testable choice; the ending’s renunciation is more atmospheric than earned. Still, his perceptual signature (violet hum of rust, aurora as banner for the drowned) is specific enough to lift him above silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s obsession with “illuminated moments” is concrete and embodied—she brushes frames, pockets time, trades risk for shimmer. The internal contradiction—thief not for wealth but for transcendence—drives every beat, culminating in the mirror confrontation where she chooses to shatter her own countdown. Micro-choices (kneeling, blade between petals, hurling the jar) track a clear hierarchy of values: beauty > survival > fate. Cost is visible: the stationmaster’s ledger blanks, her older self erased, the night she must now outrun.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for answers yet fearing the crash her father invited—is embodied in the cracked bookmark hooked on her thumbnail. Glass-cooling ritual muttered to ghosts shows occupation bleeding into identity. Final valve turn costs her the sanctuary itself, a credible forfeiture. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—craving proof yet fearing the water—are alive in the scene: her thumb bleeds on the shell while she climbs to the ledger. The cast-reading beat crystallizes her stunt-trained pattern-recognition as a usable weapon, not backstory. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak. Final stance—ledger under arm, fear still real—earns its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eldrin’s obsession with silence is embodied in the tactile handling of the booklet and his decision to let it scatter; the moment he “smiled and let the booklet slip” crystallizes a credible renunciation. Interiority is concrete—his fingers tracing gold leaf, the way night “pools”—but the contradiction between mapping and surrendering could be sharper in-scene. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. The final stance is earned, yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral because his body/thoughts stay calm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    X-7’s interior contradiction—methodical machine logic colliding with emergent self-interrogation—remains vivid and embodied in every micro-choice (bow-stroke, servo-whirr, temperature drop). The “haunting question” motive intensifies logically, culminating in the earned moment it exhales steam and claims its name. Minor ding: the memories-of-human-lives feel summarized rather than corporeally re-lived, blunting the cost edge required for 9-band. Still, the robot’s composed strain against felt wonder reads as singular, non-stock, and fully motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—thumb pressing the lens, pen hovering—but her contradictory impulses (mistrust vs. urge to help) are summarized rather than enacted in a single visible beat. The micro-choice to slide the ticket is motivated, yet the cost to her own guardedness is declared (“her heart lighter”) rather than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, and the Earned Stasis—she keeps drawing, now without camouflage—lands as a believable renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The vine dresser’s quiet, ritual polishing of cracked marbles embodies her contradictions—caretaker and accused traitor—without exposition; her refusal to argue with the elders and instead lead them to the garden’s self-mending glass is a micro-choice that crystallizes her values and costs her the last vestige of official approval.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s quietly defiant obsession is embodied from line 1 (“he wasn’t supposed to be here”), and every micro-choice—adjusting bolts, wiping oil, resting hand on the lever—keeps mechanically warm fingers and twilight-pressure present. Interior contradiction is steady: law-abiding tech vs. illicit time-bender, shown not told. The final renunciation—hand resting instead of pulling—earns its cost because earlier pulls have already vaporized K-11; the path is foreclosed. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets n/a; single-POV interiority stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory need for silence yet hunger to “disrupt” is embodied in the bow-groan when he pries the floorboard; the single, sustained note he finally offers is a credible renunciation of speech that costs him the safety of solitude. Ghost-as-mirror is never reduced to therapy-speak; instead her absence-in-sound forces his micro-choice to listen rather than play, which scales to the closing duet. Interiority stays concrete: damp program fibres “soft as skin,” water resisting “like a held note.” The earned stasis—he leaves without looking back—carries visible cost: dawn, extinguished lanterns, the now-dry program bearing only Clara Voss’s name.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—professional duty to warn vs. private need to vanish—are alive in every beat; the trembling hand on the barometer, the deliberate silence into the radio, the final step into the storm all embody the fault-tolerant mask cracking. Her interiority is sensorily anchored (“taste of copper,” “paper soft as a pulse”) and avoids label-speak. The earned renunciation costs her life and reputation, foreclosed on-page. Minor slip: the phrase “oracle could be wrong” is slightly external-diagnostic; still, the embodied cost dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority—skepticism braided with heir-of-guilt craving—shows in micro-choices: pocketing bolts, pressing ear to valve, radio-silence as shield. The swallowed-thread myth is embodied, not exposited, tilting his appraisal into self-indictment. Final refusal to flee crystallizes the hierarchy of values, cost felt in the lighter wheel: earned stasis under causal lens. Only minor hedge: the psychic-voice tag drifts toward label-speak, blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The keeper’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—mood swamps motive. “Loose grip on reality” is asserted repeatedly yet never dramatized as a concrete trade-off that alters tactics; we are told, not shown, the cost. The final renunciation (“They set it aside and waited”) is thematically apt but causally thin: no prior beat establishes what waiting forfeits. This is character-as-mood-board, not character-under-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “quiet, adaptive patience” is dramatized in the ukulele scene and the eclipse gamble; his childhood memory and tuning-fork tic give individual texture. The final micro-choice—handing the vial to Mira— crystallizes his vocational creed and costs him the keepsake, so the arc earns its shift. Interiority occasionally slides into therapeutic platitudes (“ordinary magic,” “always known how to sing”) that soften contradiction. Still, embodied listening as action carries the characterization above midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his “rusted-hinge exhale,” the way he tests tapestry heat with his cheek—and his solitary obsession is credibly embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, however; the moment of tilting-world sensation is received passively, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than wrested. Still, the endurance-cost of remaining the last listener is visible in every ladder creak, and that sustained renunciation satisfies the closure clause for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Chen’s contradiction—disbelief in fate yet scripting destinies—peaks when he palms the microdot to the girl: a micro-choice that costs him his lighthouse and twenty-year identity. Interiority stays concrete (“trembled…ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce”) and bodily (“pressed his forehead to the glass”). The final renunciation is earned: the ticket stub he himself once wrote becomes the prophecy he now obeys, visible cost in the darkened tower. Slight loss: we never see the specific moment he decides to trust the girl; the leap feels slightly outline-sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The priest’s interiority is vivid—his smile at the thing’s accusation, the quiet laugh he “allows himself” after vanishing—but we never see contradictory impulses actively contesting inside him; the motivation stays singular (illumination, not banishment) so the final surrender reads as serene rather than costly. Because the choice to let indigo consume him is not foreshadowed by an on-page dilemma, the renunciation feels symbolic, not personally wrested. Still, the embodied emotion is strong enough to lift the score near the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interior contradiction is present—writing futures yet trapped by the past—but the cost of conducting the unheard silence is gestured at more than performed. Micro-choices (ink, shell rotation, balcony pause) track clearly, yet the emotional fulcrum relies on lyric assertion (“second skin,” “when not a place”) rather than a beat where refusing to write would hurt. The arc moves from prophecy to performance, but the final conducting is still wish; we don’t feel what he forfeits if the city stops listening.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for wholeness while courting self-annihilation—are rendered through embodied, lyric interiority and micro-choices like the thumb-trace of the rune. The final merger carries felt cost: the tablet disintegrates, his lineage’s burden turns to dust on his skin, and gravity finally claims him. The “labyrinth of self” motivation stays abstract, never crystallizing into a specific, testable flaw or memory, which blunts the arc’s specificity. Still, the earned endurance of weight is a credible renunciation that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory desire to reclaim music through silence is embodied in every tactile choice; the broken needle as tactile memory and the cavern’s vibrations let us feel his interior without label-speak. The final micro-choice—accepting the wrapped needle and deciding to teach “backward”—is earned by the felt thrumming of the phonograph horn against his palm. Cost is legible: he gives up the safety of resigned isolation and risks the same scorn that broke the first needle. Interiority stays particular to a deaf craftsman; no stock “overcoming disability” arc.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific, but the “waiting for the unknown” stance keeps him reactive; the note is the first proactive beat, so the cost of solitude is asserted more than dramatized until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s aromatic fragility, lantern-maker’s precision, and slow grief-drip are embodied in every micro-gesture; the climactic recognition that the flower has been feeding on his tears crystallizes a decade of self-misreading with visible cost. Interior contradiction (guard against scent vs. need to uncork) drives the plot. Final renunciation—train toward thin air—pays that accumulated debt. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interiority remains idiosyncratic and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s “ethically playful” streak is shown only once (leaving a poem for bread) and never collides with the rope choice; the final ladder carving is asserted, not pressured. Interior contradiction is missing: he never weighs cutting the rope vs. walking away, so the pull feels abstract. Burned-smooth hands supply late cost, but the causal path from playful thief to pattern-climber is inferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority stays concrete: her father’s unfinished melody haunts her fingertips, the bowl’s ping tests aliveness. The arrival of the girl forces a micro-choice—she trades solitary grief for collaborative creation—paid for by the dawn-choice that will cost her either exile or guardianship. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, but the sustained tension between memory and forward motion is credible and particular. The cap is the slight under-show of her body under violin-fatigue; still, the final note of tomorrow earns its poise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s calibrated professionalism and micro-choice to appropriate the client’s longing give her a sharp, embodied arc; the chemist’s trembling hand and later tears show credible flaw and change. Interior contradiction—she almost laughs while absorbing his pain—keeps her from therapist stereotype. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; single-POV interiority stays particular and pressure-driven. Closure renunciation costs her the petal and the fee, earned by prior static mapping of his cowardice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s shift from profit calculator to quiet benefactor is legible; the locket hand-off crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“pieces clicking into place” vs. abstract guilt). Yet the librarian’s contradictory impulses are only asserted (“You’re a broker, not a saint”) rather than dramatized in-scene, keeping the relationship crucible one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Reed’s interiority is textured through bodily memory of reeds and the visceral act of carving; the contradiction between her outsider status and her hunger to graft onto the village is kept alive in every micro-choice. The final renunciation—she does not chase Syl—pays off prior causality: the same hands that once carved isolation now press palm-to-arbor, accepting the cost of slow-braided kinship. One slip: “her sympathy bold as the arbor’s edges” drifts into label-speak at a peak beat (−0.3). Still, the earned stasis lands with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elspeth’s interiority pulses through concrete, illustrator-specific perception: ink-bleed moths, gravity-defying brushstrokes, the pendant’s hum against bone. Her contradictory impulses—preserve/erase, sketch/let fly—collide in the canal dip and jar-hurl, earning the final storm of living moths. The boy’s “ancient eyes” pressure her choice, but he stays too symbolic to shift relationship status; still, her micro-choice hierarchy (art vs. city survival) is legible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conjurer’s contradictory drives—inventive problem-solver vs. grief-stricken husband—bleed through every micro-choice (pressing palm to withered earth, fitting the eyes into fractures). Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak; his refusal to resurrect but only “ask” crystallizes an Earned Stasis whose cost is the mist dissolving when he reaches for her face. The glass-eye weight in his pocket and the hollow in his chest form a tactile, embodied tension that scales to the length. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible exempt; single-POV voice remains idiosyncratic and internally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s hoarding of memories is embodied in the tactile relay of tape, photo, key; his seventeen-year solitude shows in every hesitant breath. The moment he steps into light, the prior cache of micro-choices (wedging the tape, letting the photo fall) crystallizes into a credible renunciation of invisibility. Flaw: the woman’s interiority is only a mirrored reaction, so the relationship crucible is one-sided. Still, Elias’s contradictory drives—guardian vs. ghost—are dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory drives—control versus surrender—are dramatized in micro-choices (pulling stakes, handing a leaf to a customer) that carry visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and plant-biased; the final synced pulse with the trunk is an embodied renunciation that forecloses her former life’s methodology. No secondary character pressure, so relationship crucible waived. The earned stasis feels proportionate to length and causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia-painter identity is concrete: “hadn’t slept through a full night since the water wars,” fingers “rough from turpentine,” and the first canvas action is rejecting the old horizon. His choice to descend the spiral stair crystallizes the internal contradiction—curiosity vs. exhaustion—and the final return to paint the convergent image shows visible cost (the brooch on pillow, straight rain). The amber woman supplies external pressure, but the story still earns its stance through Elias’s embodied micro-choices. Minor slip: the “threshing” dialogue is slightly label-like, but the embodied cost overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulse—decades of foresight yet blindsided by the cave—drives every beat; her embodied awe and the renunciation of the pearl feel earned. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-labeling in “she finally understood,” but the cost of relinquishing certainty is visible. Micro-choices (bare feet on breathing stone, trembling fingers) keep interiority concrete. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: she forecloses the seer-path, heart full, hands empty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his trembling need to restore voice vs. his final refusal to blow—are lived in scene, not told. The moment he presses the valve to his lips *to listen* crystallizes a character-specific perceptual signature that carries through to the earned renunciation, foreclosing the path of public proclamation with visible cost: he tosses the valve away, ledger lighter, exile’s silence accepted as creative material. Interiority stays salt-cracked and embodied; no diagnostic label-speak. The micro-choice hierarchy (archive vs. audience) is legible and scaled to 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s grief-anchored precision and the sister-shaped hole inside it are rendered through tactile micro-choices—compass adjustment, punch tremor, final crease—so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete; only the sister’s direct dialogue slips toward exposition, slightly blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s skeptical-scientist interiority stays concrete, her grief never diagnosed, always enacted (tracing symbols until ink bleeds, palms obsidian-stained). The micro-choice to keep transcribing even after the impossible vision appears crystallizes her shift from data to echo; cost is felt when she lets the parchment fly, surrendering proof. Brother’s remembered whistle is specific enough to prevent generic loss-portrait. No contradiction under pressure; competence (star-mapping hands) paired with believable helplessness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lysander’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. the fragment’s seductive unknown—are alive in every beat; dropping the fragment is a micro-choice that costs him the last anchor of self-continuity. The copper vein he pockets is the visible, felt price of renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“weightless, dimensionally aware”) without label-speak. One hairline slip: “immortal” is stated not shown in the first 60 words, but later texture compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—math of cons vs hunger for fairness—are dramatized in every beat; the moment she hesitates with the nib, then chooses to “write the minister’s name,” embodies the pivot. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the blank ledger) carries visible cost: the ink still warm on her skin, sirens closing. Only the girl’s pressure feels slightly abstract, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stationer’s texture-collecting obsession is vivid, embodied in the trembling finger on gilded leaf and the pocket-worn notepad; his micro-choice to transcribe the lamp’s new hum launches the Elara dig. Interiority stays concrete, but the “wished for a different kind of time” line drifts toward diagnostic paraphrase, blunting the final contradiction needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Daniel’s erased existence drives every beat; the interior contradiction between clinging to scraps of identity and surrendering to erasure is vivid in his micro-choices—pressing the label to his chest, folding his own obituary into the crack. The final shedding of the ledger page is earned: he pays with total self-dispersal, a cost felt in the image of water closing without ripple. Flaw: we never see him risk discovery or confrontation, so the stakes stay internal; still, the endurance is credibly costly and specific to this ghosted psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—debunker vs. seeker—are alive in every micro-choice (pluck, laugh, skin-ink). The final renunciation of “solving” for “adding” is credibly paid by the decade-long chase and the blank shell. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the grandmother’s voice edges toward convenient wisdom, keeping it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s double loyalty is vivid—the brass cuff and stolen chip are constant tactile reminders—and her spray-paint choices externalise the split. Interiority is concrete (“gnawed at her”, “chest tightened”). The final stance crystallises with cost: she forfeits mainland order for Lumina’s chaos, but the chip’s insertion into wet paint is more emblematic than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—scientist vs. elegist—are embodied in every micro-choice: the camera shutter as both theft and prayer, the canister as weapon and wreath. The grain of sand is never allowed to become kitsch because his gloved thumb keeps testing its weight against the drill-bit countdown. Interiority stays concrete (“his breath crystallize,” “pulse steady despite the ache”) and the renunciation—walking away while the photograph still glows—pays the full cost of witness. Flaw is not moral decal but operational: curiosity has made him complicit and now makes him exile.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile perception and quiet agency are vivid; his refusal to speak to the captain crystallizes a lifetime of earned status. The interior contradiction—knowing the ship is flawed yet not needing recognition—lands as credible renunciation. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (sliding film, knelt at barrel) reveal hierarchy of values; cost is felt in the solitary return to broken watches. Missing only a hairline slip: diagnostic self-awareness “dreams need patience” edges toward aphorism, not embodiment, keeping it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s dry-witted atlas-editor persona is vividly rendered through sensory micro-choices (condensation as map, page dissolved into currents). Interior contradiction is present—skepticism vs. surrender—and her final step onto the ice is an earned renunciation that costs her the known world. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets not scored; competent-but-vulnerable balance maintained. The herald identity lands as credible inevitability rather than convenient twist.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tuner’s gauntness and stained fingers are vivid, but his interiority stays atmospheric—“infinitely patient” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse is shown in scene; he walks, strikes, listens, never hesitates or revises. The only micro-choice—quickened pace—tracks with stakes, yet feels instinctive rather than costly. Still, his embodied solitude and the fork’s weight keep him particular; the laughter payoff lands because we recognize his steadiness as the engine.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s contradictory drives—guilt vs. need for absolution—are embodied in micro-choices (uncorking vial, pressing wrist to nose). The renunciation of diving is credibly earned, but the interiority occasionally drifts into poetic self-diagnosis (“the hush had taught her the weight of words”) that flattens peak emotion. Still, the character-specific sensory bias (salt, violets, jellyfish light) keeps her singular. Cost is visible: she trades the sea for dry land, carrying the perfume ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s hunger to “change the beginning” is vivid, but his interiority leans on abstract labels—“hush,” “echoes,” “story”—rather than concrete contradictory impulse. The lattice burn in his sleeve embodies cost, yet the decision to pluck his father’s name feels slightly convenient; no prior beat shows him doubting the act. Still, the final smile and walk back to the reef show a credible endurance that forecloses innocence. The father-son tension is implied, not staged, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s contradictory hunger/love drives every beat; the bead-burn in the final gesture shows cost. Vesper’s half-sapling form externalizes her flaw. Keeper’s bark-hands and sigh supply status tension without head-count clutter. Micro-choice hierarchy (bead > veil > breath) legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through salt-worn hands and canyon-mouthed breath; his contradictory impulse to mend while surrendering to sleepwalking is dramatized in the Heart Chamber beat. The micro-choice to press the plate to stone crystallizes his hierarchy of values—ruin versus reverence—and costs him the old wharf identity. “What was lost was never gone” lands as earned wisdom, not label-speak, because it’s tethered to the visible red-veined wings now etched in rock. Flaw complicity is present: his optimism literally redraws the world, yet the price—paths unraveling behind him—stays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his laugh is “raw and disbelieving,” his touch on the sundial “wondering if faith could be dug up.” The contradictions between skepticism and longing are held in scene, not alternated in summary. The micro-choice to plant the seed in the hollow stone makes the final rupture of that stone feel earned. Missing a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets idle; the score caps just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract; her “carefully inventive” label never concretely collides with a contradictory impulse or visible cost. The final mailbox beat is acceptance, not renunciation, so the “earned stasis” feels light—no path is foreclosed on-page. She remains a competent cipher rather than a person risking something we can touch.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet, fiber-deep resistance is embodied in every stitch; the contradiction between his public “fool” persona and the private astronomer’s precision is lived, not labeled. The final smile while the dome shatters is a credible renunciation that costs him everything, yet the interiority never slips into self-congratulatory wisdom. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; his solitude is the point.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—letter clutched yet withheld, shard pressed but not bled—are dramatized in tactile beats; the final release is earned by prior micro-choices and carries a felt cost (loss of the letter’s literal weight). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: silence < apology < surrender. The change is credible but the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible pressure is implied not staged; this caps the score beneath 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s contradictory translator/healer reflexes—simultaneous decryption and empathy—surface in every tactile micro-choice (coral pressed, cast traced, silence offered). The “shrewdly innocent” label becomes lived: her instant re-weighting of crayon smudges as dialect, her refusal to look up at the boy until she has re-coded his loss. Interiority stays embodied—no diagnostic speak—only ribs humming, breath fog, finger ridges on plaster. Final act of handing over the coral is a renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses her own talisman to stitch his shore, earned by every prior decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—yearning to resurrect joy while fearing the cost of trespassing time—animates every micro-choice (kneeling to dig, pressing fragment to film, deciding to hang the images). Her body remembers: stained fingers, trembling hands, breath curling into dark, all anchoring emotion without label-speak. The fresco fragment as “promise” rather than relic reweights her prior solitude; she pays the price of exposure (the film will fade, the crowd will disperse) yet chooses to mix new paints, an earned stasis that forecloses retreat. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so relationship dynamics are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—preservation vs. creation—surfaces early and drives every re-entry; the final choice to paint a door is earned. Yet her emotional registers lean on abstract labels (“curiosity bloomed”) rather than embodied sensation, and the looping awakenings blur micro-choice into montage, softening the cost felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s rogue-charmer persona is vivid, tactile (seeds in palm, dirt under nails) and internally consistent; his charisma slides him through raids yet never feels omnipotent because every beat shows him calibrating risk. The micro-choice of swapping dandelion for rosemary under drone gaze dramatizes contradictory impulses—care-taking vs. provocation—with visible cost (discovery could fine or erase him). Secondary cast are sketched by memorable shorthand (librarian hiding thesaurus in sock) that still pressures the scheme, so headcount stays coherent. The only brake: “they’re watching the words now” edges toward thematic label-speak; the line is brief enough to keep the score sub-9 but prevents full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    The poet’s contradictory engines—300-year wakefulness yet shyness that splits stone—are dramatized in embodied beats: palm-to-ghost-sternum, eating the manual, casting the sun-borrowing net. Each micro-choice costs her immediacy (no sleep, no anonymity) and forecloses retreat, earning the final cocooned stasis. Interiority pulses with calcium-veined ink instead of labels. Minor slip: “reef-shadow joy” is named once without embodiment; still, contradiction lives in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is rich—her tactile rituals with the orchids, the match flare, the trembling palm—but the decisive renunciation (“let the chime fall”) arrives with only a single line of interior justification. The contradiction between curator-instinct and destroyer-act is present, yet the hinge moment feels slightly under-dramatized; we see the gesture, not the internal cost calculus that makes it inevitable. Still, her lifetime of echo-hoarding is embodied in every beat, and the final empty-handed stillness is a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-driven interiority stays concrete—“her name scrawled in the margin of a treaty she’d never seen” fuses biographical and ethical pressure. The “carefully reckless” trait is dramatized twice (ink dip, palm-to-paper-sing) and is not label-only. There is no second character, so relationship bullets are waived. Cost is felt (shattering glass, bleeding palm implied) but the final stance crystallizes rather than changes—powerful yet technically Earned Stasis; the lack of a live contradiction in-scene keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—her fingers “tracing the grooves,” pulse stutter, the chain “coiled like a promise”—and her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. insurgence) act simultaneously in the decisive beat. The final choice is earned: every elder stare, every brass link, every breath of the volcano has primed her refusal. Cost is legible: “the valley would breathe. And so would she” — a mutiny against her own legacy. No safety-hedging; she is genuinely flawed and still chooses irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s trembling hand, meteorite pressed to palm, embodies the contradiction between fleeing music and needing its echo; the pigeon’s return crystallizes his Earned Stasis—he hums rusty notes, the attic now “smells like the sea,” a sensory reprice that costs him the safety of silence. Interiority stays aria-specific (sheet-music wings, ink like dried roses) and never drifts into therapy-speak. The only cap: off-page Luca never applies direct pressure, so relationship-as-crucible bullet remains inactive.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his breath hitching, fingers reading wood grain—but Liora remains a symbol (“featherly determined,” “sacred shake”) rather than a child whose contradictory wants we feel. The final climb-down is motivated, yet the prior beat where he simply “understood” her cryptic pronouncement is abstract, not embodied. Still, his flawed paternal need to control vs. surrender tracks cleanly to the earned stasis inside the sinkhole.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory need to map belonging while refusing to leave the drowned lab is embodied in micro-choices (pressing the burnt feather to her lips, logging coordinates). The moment she takes Kael’s hand, the cost of staying below is made visible: she forfeits the surface he will return to. Interiority is concrete and sensor-tethered; no epiphany is abstract. The only minor slack is that Kael’s scar-backstory is delivered as label (“holding onto something too tightly”) rather than dramatized gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recollectionist’s interiority is rich—blood glowing like the cave heart, laughter echoing like seashells—but the emotional arc is mostly reception rather than choice; she “lets the memories in” rather than risking a deliberate act. The final “next time I’ll follow you farther” hints at agency, yet it’s a deferred promise, not a present-tense cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the self-revelation arrives as a gift, not a wrested decision. Credible, lyrical, but short of earned contradiction and visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lior’s “analytical street performer” label is vivid, but his interior calculus—calculating wave, torch, laugh cadences—never cracks under pressure or yields a self-contradiction we can feel. The bishop and the violin act as extensions of mind, yet the only bodily cost is a cooled ankle; no forfeiture or fatigue registers. The renunciation (“I played the space between the notes”) is declared, not dramatized; the stance crystallizes without visible toll, keeping the arc just sub-Earned. Micro-choices remain intellectually cool, so emotional heat and genuine flaw stay theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses—penance vs. hunger for cosmic inscription—are alive in every beat; the micro-choice to grind and then press the moonstone dust into flesh makes exile feel like a door left ajar. Final renunciation (“the sea would rise and fall without her”) lands with cost visible in the charged poise of her inked skin. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One hairline slip: “memory was a kind of drowning” flirts with abstraction, but is instantly re-grounded by the heron vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s quiet, tactile ritualism embodies the “reflective glazier” with every micro-choice: selecting the stone, aligning the prism, reading the rings. Interiority is concrete—calloused fingers, fogged breath, the prism’s warming glass—never diagnostic. The final, wordless turn back toward the dock crystallizes Earned Stasis: he pays with continued solitude, yet the atrium’s pulse is felt. Only the off-stage daughter drifts toward label (“I miss the light”), a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clutching the box yet finally leaving it—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (tracing scars, opening the lid, drawing on stone). The milk-tooth/violet/note triad makes the interior cost tactile; the final renunciation is earned because every beat has shown him testing whether he can “hand pain to someone else without cutting them.” Voice stays gravel-specific, never drifts into label-speak. The only minor slip: the phone-send emoji beat feels fractionally faster than his prior hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    Interiority is lyrically specific but drifts into abstraction; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—choices are declarative (“she understood”) rather than embodied under pressure. Micro-choices are present but lack visible cost; the final stance is asserted, not earned through renunciation or trade-off. The “logical dreamer” trait is named but never complicates her tactics or skews perception; emotional states glide rather than collide.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s profession and grief are vividly anchored; the negative-in-hand tremble embodies contradiction between detachment and need. The moment he aligns the film strip to the blank mural patch, motive crystallizes into visible cost—he forfeits the safety of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the father’s “maybe” voice lacks full prior seeding, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her refusal to view her own reflection crystallizes the cost of her trade—but the borrowed heartbeat never manifests as bodily tension or micro-choice; it stays abstract. The final renunciation is earned, yet the soldier’s off-stage ache is told, not shown through her. Still, her stillness-as-grace reads as a consistent, character-specific ritual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s contradictory impulse—clinging to ritual while admitting treaties break—lives in embodied micro-choices: thumb on fresh notch, steady hand despite tremor. Kael’s armor creak & reluctant signature show parallel fracture. Cost is visible: new soft notch = fresh graves. Interiority avoids label-speak; “quiet violence of hope” is specific to her trained restraint. Both remain credibly flawed; neither is redeemed, only “installment” paid.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s contradictory interior—philanthropic architect of drought, clandestine mourner of birds—powers every beat; the egg-handling is a micro-choice that externalizes the split. His refusal to weep or vault the egg is a stoic renunciation whose cost is felt in the final “echo of a wingspan.” The amoral math that built reservoirs is not reversed, only interrupted, satisfying Earned Stasis. Voice stays particular, never sliding into diagnostic labels; embodied emotion (“fingers trembling,” “salt on his knees”) anchors abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—chaste courtesan who risks everything to free silenced voices—drives every beat; her bare feet on frozen stone, steady fingers on threads, and final laugh embody the cost. Micro-choices (untangle vs break) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible bodily price. The “living poem of restraint” never collapses into label-speak; instead, her stillness absorbs echoes and forecloses the safe path. Motive holds to the last line: she pays the cold price, threads snap, gates seal—earned stasis delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his fingers “rolling a charred stick,” the grandfather cue, the quiet decision to let puppets stumble tomorrow—but the miner’s shout is the only external pressure, received not tested. No contradictory impulse is acted in-scene; the epiphany is a stillness rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The serenity trait is shown, not told, yet it smooths rather than complicates the final stance, lessening felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s quiet obsession—cataloguing wind while building ephemeral memorials—remains vivid and specific; his hands speak louder than any interior monologue. The spiral’s construction is a chain of micro-choices that externalize his need to “honor what the world forgot,” each knot tightening his commitment. Yet the story stops short of forcing him to pay a private, legible price: no withheld desire, no risked relationship, no moment where the spiral could cost him something he visibly craves. That absence keeps the arc shy of the 9-band, but the embodied attention still carries real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s guilt-driven need to atone is palpable and embodied in her tactile handling of card and rope; the moment she presses palm to glowing strands crystallizes her interior arc. Yet her “technically gentle” trait is invoked rather than dramatized—no beat shows her gentleness costing her anything—so the flaw-to-cost pipeline feels asserted, not lived. Still, the renunciation of silence lands as earned stasis with visible warmth under ice. Voice remains coherent, but the absence of contradictory impulse under pressure keeps her just shy of 9-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. dread—are embodied in micro-choices (pressing the seal, touching the wall) that cost her certainty; the final renunciation of the path is earned by this accumulated interior friction. The ash-ing of the seal externalizes the price. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak. One hairline slip: “her laughter lost in the downpour” edges toward performed emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Qishti’s interiority—"measured steps," "frugal rhythm," "pulse quickened, not with greed, but with the empirically ironic thrill"—is concrete and idiosyncratic. His contradictory impulses (scientific skepticism vs. craving the unseen) coexist in-scene and drive the tile choice. The final kneel is a credibly earned renunciation of numerical certainty; the cost is felt when the lines tattoo themselves onto his skin, foreclosing a purely quantitative life. Minor deduction: the epiphany is slightly articulated ("some devotions are too vast for numbers") rather than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—clutching the broken pin yet seeking release—play out in embodied beats (fingers tracing the lid, the deliberate re-insertion). The micro-choice to press the pin back is earned by the prior causality of resentment and the sanctuary’s pressure. Brother-status shifts are legible in the ghost-boy’s teasing and the final shoulder-touch. Cost is felt when the music box is abandoned whole, proving grace is in the walking away, not the song.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mirror-maker’s renunciation/merger is legible, but the interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“grounding is just another kind of flight”) that tells us the emotional arithmetic instead of dramatizing contradictory impulses in the moment of dissolution. Because the transformation is accomplished almost entirely by atmospheric fiat rather than a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path, the cost feels conceptual rather than personal, keeping the score below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—"their fingers brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse"—and the contradiction between parental duty and the need to let vows fall is active in every beat. The final gesture of tying the ribbon around their own wrist crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (digging, biting the apple) trace a clear hierarchy of values. Only the daughter remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is implied, not dramatized; still, the ache is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s hunger for knowledge feels lived-in via her ritual of retreating to the bathroom to "think" and her seventeen-year cataloguing obsession, but the climactic shift to renunciation ("she would do neither") is stated rather than dramatized with a tangible choice beat, so the cost is conceptually legible yet not embodied on the page—right beneath the 9-band gate that demands causal proof of change.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s hunger for “gaps” is vivid and embodied—his teeth on edge in the humming air, his spectacles cracked. The contradictory pull—thief vs. seeker—drives every beat, and the final collapse into weeping is earned by the diary’s blanking and the name he can’t keep. Interiority sometimes drifts into label-speak (“genuinely flawed”) but micro-choices (pressing the tea, stepping into the chasm) keep the arc legible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Liora’s interiority is razor-specific: the scale-patch on her wrist, the compulsive thumb on the emerald swatch, the moment she tears the ledger page and watches the ink vanish. Twin-loss grief is rendered as corporeal ritual, not label-speak. The final choice—to stay and become gate-keeper—grows straight from her established obsession with “narrative threads” and costs her the escape she could have taken. Her flaws (guilt, compulsive story-weaving) drive every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lush, profession-specific, and consistently embodied; her fingers “tracing grooves,” breath fogging the air, and the micro-choice to re-braid the rope all ground her motives. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and fable-longing is present, yet the epiphany (“she would become part of it”) is declared more than dramatized, so the final cost feels lightly而不是 viscerally earned. Still, her archival reflexes—notebook withheld, seal pocketed—offer a credible, occupation-rooted renunciation. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Eldrin’s decision to collaborate through the bloom of hush is earned by embodied, contradictory interiority (he fears, listens, yet yields). Micro-choices—kneeling, releasing tension, pressing the stone to his chest—crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible cost: the stone goes dark, the cave re-writes itself, his purpose shifts from record-keeper to co-author. No diagnostic self-talk; every emotional beat is shown through tactile action filtered by his mapper’s bias. Flaw remains present: endurance chosen over triumph, foreclosing isolationist preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid—"quiet in her own ribs," "hush...predated sound"—and the childhood memory beat anchors motive. Yet the final turn ("of course it had never been about bringing the past back") is asserted rather than dramatized inside the present moment; the cost is named but not felt through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative. Still, the contradiction between nostalgic ache and pragmatic loneliness is embodied throughout, keeping her above the 8.3 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is poetic but never diagnostic; the preemptive nostalgia trait is shown through her tactile ritual with the flags and the refusal to name the hush at the end. The single micro-choice—pressing her palm to the stone without measuring—carries visible cost (the forecourt “absorbs the memory of her passing”) and earns the shift from archivist to listener. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only understated resignation, so the beat stays efficient rather than crucible-level. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature and the embodied laugh-of-absurdity vision keep her credibly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—her chant, her finger on the rag knot, her decision to climb. Contradictory drives (loneliness vs defiance) stay active in-scene. The final “heavier” self-recognition is earned, but the leap from spectacle to personal cost is compressed into one sentence; more body-level fallout would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and specific to the chronicler’s perceptual lens; her silences and micro-choices (pressing the cicada into the fisherman’s hand) carry cost. The “texture of time” motive remains abstract—never tested against a concrete reversal—so the change feels轻 rather than crucible-forced. Still, her refusal to explain and the final damp sleeve give visible endurance with price, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The child’s interiority is rendered through sensorial metaphors (taste of silence, lungs shrinking) that stay concrete and character-specific. Motive progression—fear → curiosity → filial betrayal—tracks cleanly; the final door-image is earned because the doll-tasting method was dramatized twice before. Father remains a functional pressure source rather than a full secondary interiority, acceptable for this length. No diagnostic self-talk; every emotional label is translated into bodily perception.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s “learned stillness” is shown through tactile ritual (cradling vial, copper spoon dip) but his interior contradiction is implied rather than enacted in-scene. The passenger stays opaque—grief is signaled by gloves and exhale, never tested by choice—so the relationship crucible is absent and status dynamics inert. Micro-choices (angling prisms, dial turns) do reweight silence, yet the cost is atmospheric, not personal; renunciation is gentle drift rather than visible forfeit. Interiority is lyrical, not diagnostic, but still skates close to label-speak (“the weight she carried had been recalibrated”) without dramatized bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elsin’s solitary scholar-stance is concrete—gloved fingers on bark, equations etched in brass lenses—yet her emotional interior stays slightly abstract (“the weight of the unclaimed throne lifting” as felt cost). The decisive renunciation is foreshadowed by mural command “sally forth, but not upward,” so the final walk-away carries credible, earned cost. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; a touch more embodied friction under rising pressure would sharpen the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“fingers tracing the doorknocker ring,” “stones in his pockets”—but the final renunciation relies on a whispered epiphany (“he understood then”) rather than a micro-choice visibly costing him. The contradiction between lifelong avoidance and instant surrender feels slightly under-cooked, keeping the change just shy of fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lina’s interior contradiction—survivor cynic yet curiosity-driven risk-taker—drives every beat; her mischievous grin at the final text and bleeding-palm grip show embodied cost. Micro-choices (pry, twist, pocket, walk) steadily escalate from curiosity to ownership to renunciation. Mother backstory is anchored to present stimuli (bolt, desert wind) and tilts her stance. Flaw (reflexive mistrust) compounds rather than heals, earning the empty-hand / warm-diamond switch.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—dynasty shame vs hunger for legacy—stays active: he strikes the floorboard because he both fears and needs the truth. Emotion is embodied (cold brass, breath-held wave) not labelled. The final micro-choice—writing for an unknown successor—caps a believable arc, though the shift from passive muser to bridge-scribe feels slightly abrupt; one more beat of visible cost would lift this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The knight’s muteness and armor-weld function as lived, embodied costs; the final smile burns. Interiority stays sensory—metal whispers, paper warm like skin—never abstract. Yet we get no contradictory want (he never considers keeping silent) so the arc is linear, not torn. Still, the renunciation lands with felt price: shadows pour from the gauntlet and the stage invites him—an Earned Stasis that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s broken-hearted archivist is realized through tactile, embodied beats—thumb tracing manila spines, chair creak under weight—that make his ache lived-in. The moment he slides the brass button into the envelope, we see a hierarchy of values: archives’ impotence vs. need to gift a lost boy a grandfather. Interiority stays specific—exhaling “through his nose when the weight…pressed too hard”—never drifting into therapeutic labels. Final choice costs him institutional neutrality; risk is felt, but the button’s causal role is slightly under-dramatized mid-scene, keeping him just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lena’s “harmless archivist” label and her boot-concealed key give her a sharp, usable contradiction; the interior line “she wasn’t a hero” feels diagnostic but her later micro-choice to pocket-warm the key and step into the shallows embodies the cost of endurance. Yet her emotional spectrum stays narrow—no moment of fury, panic, or genuine doubt breaks through the calm register, so the renunciation feels efficient rather than torn. The ledger theft is referenced off-stage; because we don’t see her hands trembling while she lifts it, the beat leans summary and caps how high the arc can rise.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The saxophonist’s motivation—silencing a prophecy by playing silence itself—remains lucid and intensifies: each note is a deliberate erasure that costs him breath, time, and finally self-knowledge. Interiority stays concrete (“he feared the day he’d stop hearing its call”) and drives the return trip, a credible renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—fingers stilling at the moon-dust, cheek-hiding reflex, climbing toward the crown—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (order vs. oracle). The final transformation is earned: she pays with her human skin, feels bark dapple her, and accepts thorn-tipped fingers; cost is visible, irreversible, and scaled to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tinkerer’s interiority is rich—his trembling hands, refusal to discard the broken clock, and laughter at the waterfall’s question all embody a man whose flaw is attachment to brokenness. Contradictory impulses (fix vs. unmake) coexist in scene, and the final renunciation—letting the last gear go—pays the cost of that attachment. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he understood then”) that momentarily lifts us into abstraction rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s interiority is dense and embodied—her “tremor in the ribs” while feeding the coin shows contradictory fear/drive in one beat. The rivalrous backstory with Veyra is anchored to present micro-choices (staying, uncorking the vial), so motivation stays causal. Final stance crystallizes: she will “carry the weight differently,” a renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: “learned to carry it” is slightly therapist-adjacent, but saved by the concrete act of feeding the vial to the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—her duty to collect grief and her private need to laugh—are alive in every beat; the crocodile tooth warms against her skin as both talisman and wound, and her final micro-choice (plucking the “ours” note) renounces standard release and accepts permanent co-habitation with the soul, a cost she pays by carrying the laughter out of the gorge. The backstory fragment about her mother is anchored to the present cue (the tooth) and directly tilts her decision to trade sorrow for shared humor. No diagnostic label-speak; body signals (“teeth ache”) are specific and unclichéd. The absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets inactive; head-count is thus waived.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liran’s interiority is visceral—proprioception as live wire, the mask-strap as tourniquet—each micro-choice (kneeling, dipping fingers, accepting the forest’s pull) externalizes a hierarchy of values under duress. The contradictory impulse survives: he both yields to and masters the ultraviolet baptism, earning a credible renunciation of the equation. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Cost is felt in the snapped strap and steady hands—an earned stasis that forecloses vengeance-as-math.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lior’s interiority is sensorially anchored and her childhood flashback to the lighthouse pulses with embodied memory, giving credible weight to her need for an anchor. The contradiction between translating the intangible and craving the tangible stays live in the moment she slots the lens fragment, but the final “she was the hand that reached” declaration drifts toward self-mythologizing, blunting the cost of acceptance. Still, her micro-choice to pocket the wet brush instead of speaking crystallizes her hierarchy of values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet, tactile professionalism is vivid and consistent; the mainspring barrel as tactile lodestone externalizes his vocation. Interior contradiction is present—“wasn’t here for the ghosts, though he saw them”—but the pivot from curiosity to mercy at the end is more asserted than dramatized in body or tool. The ghosts remain symbols rather than relationship crucibles, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. Still, his final micro-choices (loosening bolts, pocketing the silent barrel) earn a visible renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—decades spent caging volatile truths, yet choosing release—plays in real time through the micro-choice to uncork the bottle. Embodied cost is palpable as the library dissolves over his skin. The final smile is earned: he both destroys and becomes the system he served. No safety-hedging; his ruin feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s contradictory hunger for “revision not vengeance” is dramatized in the shard’s grip and his refusal to rise when Taelis confronts him—micro-choices that cost him the relic itself. The interiority is embodied, not labeled (warm pulse against wrist, weight lifted). The final renunciation—pressing palm to empty altar—earns its poise because every prior beat has tied his self-forgiveness to the shard’s destruction. Only the off-stage comrades feel generic, blunting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory need to “mend” while surrendering to the stone’s hunger is embodied in trembling hands and cracked laughter; the final gift of “light” burns him away, so the cost is visible. Interiority stays concrete—“ghost of a melody,” “fishhook in the ribs”—never drifting into label-speak. One micro-choice—pressing the chip to his chest—triggers the irreversible turn, earned by thirty years of invisible mends. The only absence is a second character to pressure status, but single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; his “fear of explanations that won’t come” is a believable flaw that drives every step. The micro-choice to touch the arch is the decisive turn, and the renunciation of further delving lands with visible cost—he burns the notes, foreclosing his old life. Psychometry as motive is shown through embodied sensation, not label-speak. The only minor slip: the father’s voice arrives as disembodied exposition rather than filtered memory, slightly undercutting the earned moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his palm against salt-crusted stone, the lantern slide “warm as if alive”—and his final carving of an open hand is a micro-choice that costs him the talismanic slide. Yet the leap from “perpetually learning” to “loom” epiphany is slightly abstract; the internal contradiction between commerce and legacy could be pressed harder in-scene to earn the renunciation fully.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    Interiority is lyrically sustained but stays at one altitude; we never feel contradictory heat or doubt undercutting her drive. Micro-choices are mostly "paint / look / write" without tangible trade-off or visible price until the blank postcard—too late to test her. Earned stasis is asserted rather than dramatized; the stillness carries no bodily cost we can witness.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s shift from passive archivist to active medium is embodied and earned: the diary-burn at the end carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete—“salt-stung air,” “pulse hammered in his throat”—and contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) act simultaneously in-scene. The final renunciation is foreshadowed by every micro-choice with the shells and locket, satisfying causality. Flaws: “thirty years as a civil-rights archivist” is told-only, never tested under pressure; no secondary character pressure on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—clinging to rejection of comfort while secretly courting resurrection—drives every beat; the moment he chooses to “conceive” rather than wish, his stoic mask cracks and the cost (empty bottle, vanished child) is felt on-page. Micro-choices (kneeling, fingers tightening, refusal to open eyes) embody the stakes. The town’s spectral return is credible because his memory, not miracle, is the engine. No stock labels; even “second beginning” is earned by prior causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and embodied—his cold fingers, the tremor in his pulse—contradictory impulses (curiosity vs dread) act simultaneously. The final act of sketching his own fear-pattern and burying the wax beneath the oldest tree crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost, earning Charged Poise. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choice hierarchy (record fear, seal, bury) is legible and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is sharp—her refusal to touch the chick, the tremor in her fingers, the remembered warmth of her grandmother’s hands—all concrete, embodied, and particular. The contradiction between furious calm and the vortex’s threat is held in scene, not stated. The final smile lands as earned renunciation: she pays with her mother’s voice already lost and the certainty the vortex will return, yet she pockets the new cap anyway. Only micro-slip: “furiously tranquil” is named once rather than shown through a final bodily flash, but the oak-root-breaking-stone image still crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s tactile, sound-centered interiority is vivid and consistent; the moment he palms the bell lip and “lets the vibration travel…into the marrow” embodies motive and flaw in one beat. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of self-diagnosis (“not for the sound they made, but for the silence they preserved”) that edges into thesis-speak; still, the renunciation of abbot approval for wind-earning costs him social safety and is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eli’s interiority is vivid—his calloused hands, fogged breath, lantern trace—yet the decisive shift from isolation to porous witness is asserted more than dramatized; the star’s flare answers a whispered “I see you” without visible cost or contradiction inside him, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The beekeeper’s seventeen-year silence, tactile handling of the box, choice to open it under spectral pressure, and final disappearance after rebuilding the oasis compose a credible arc of renunciation-with-cost. His muteness functions as both flaw and ethic, visibly complicating every interaction; the moment he lifts the honeycomb to the ghosts, we read the irreversible price of breaking silence. Interior contradiction is shown through trembling breath fogging glass versus outward steadiness. The only drag: “tranquilly perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized in mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s ritual with the dead watch, the warmth of the urn shard against his palm, and the final smile as he begins to wind the twin watch all embody a believable, embodied arc of a man who “unravels” rather than preserves time. Interiority is concrete—his breath visible, the watch’s tick “like a heartbeat after a long sleep”—and the micro-choice to climb the silo stairs reweights his goal from repair to re-weaving. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the highest band remains just out of reach, but the earned renunciation of “fixing” time carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    The poet’s interiority is lyrically specific—his habit of “tending the incomplete” grounds motive—but no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; the kite-snag and feather-quill beats reveal preference, not conflicted choice. Emotional stakes stay abstract (“beauty from ruin”) without a moment where renunciation or error costs him. The final line’s self-annointment is poetically resonant yet causally unearned: we never see him refuse an easier completeness, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s stubborn devotion to the orchard is palpable through her tactile micro-choices: wrapping copper, tracing grooves, refusing the elders’ corner. The diary and wire act as extensions of her will, giving every gesture a cost that scales to her fading body. Her final stillness, hand on warm wire, crystallizes a life-long stance; the sapling’s turn toward stone is the earned external proof. One hairline slip: “brazen” is declared not dramatized—yet the diary line pays the bill.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. yearning—are alive in every micro-choice; the amber fly’s dissolve into her veins literalizes the cost of belief. Interiority avoids label-speak; her father’s trembling hands moment is specific, embodied, and motivates the final assent. The earned renunciation (she goes, never returns) carries visible price under the Accumulative lens. Only the figure’s dialogue slips toward allegorical convenience, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coachman’s solitary, obsessive vocation is rendered through concrete micro-choices—splitting pods, mimicking terns, mapping weeping soil—each action exposing his need to atone for witnessed slaughter. Contradictory impulses (ritual piety vs. refusal to pray) live inside single beats, and the final renunciation of recognition (“no markers”) is earned by the prior night’s emptying of pockets. Emotional cost is palpable yet unspoken; bones quiet as pods perfectly mirrors his future silence. Voice remains carved by wind and salt, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rook’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; “old bloodhound heart” gestures emotion without concrete contradiction under pressure. His final acquiescence to the vines is legible as renunciation, yet the cost is asserted rather than embodied—no aching joints, no last scent-memory of the woman. Because the choice is singular and not complicated by competing impulses, characterization trends archetypal rather than individuated. Still, the steady link between cylinder→leaf→dome gives him a functional through-line within the short span.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is deftly embodied—her palm on frost-bitten metal, the warming compass rose—and her contradictory need to stay yet leap is held in tension until the final beat. The micro-choice to align the charcoal sketch with the stars is causally earned, paying off her family’s custom and paying the cost of leaving air, history, and body behind. Flaw is implied (obsessive solitude) but never triangulated against another live character, so status crucible is absent; at this length it is acceptable. Voice is specific, not stock, and the final renunciation is felt as both liberation and death.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lirien’s contradictory impulses—thief vs caretaker, grief vs wonder—are alive in every tactile beat; the micro-choice to swap the sundial lid and leave the knight-map crystallizes her hierarchy of values at visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“breath curling in shapes that weren’t quite smoke”) and never slips into label-speak. The earned renunciation of revenge for restoration closes her arc with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—“pain was the only thing the penumbra couldn’t digest” bodies her motive; her steps-as-letters micro-choices under rising dark visibly escalate stakes. The shift from grief-performer to silence-archivist is dramatized, not declared, and the final refusal to narrate costs her the shelter of story itself—felt cost on the page. Contradictory impulse—clutching bishop vs. releasing wings—peaks in one compressed beat, satisfying the 9+ test. Missing 0.3 to reach 9.0 because no secondary character pressure tests her; all status forces are abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—hunger for the stone vs. terror of his own sight—are alive in every tactile beat; the mercury residue he leaves on spines embodies the price. The final act of writing glyphs onto shelves is the earned, irreversible cost: he trades isolation for custodianship, foreclosing an ordinary life. Interiority stays concrete (“silver turning to storm”), never retreating into label-speak. Only the childhood suppression is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the earliest causal root.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tutor’s contrition is embodied in the tactile obsession with the tapestry threads; each tug externalizes guilt. The girl’s single spoken line crystallizes the relational crucible and forces the tutor’s micro-choice to kneel and re-weave. Interiority stays concrete, but “learning to beat without shame” drifts toward diagnostic-speak, blunting the edge. Change is earned, yet the absence of visible flaw-cost on the page caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—charcoal dust under nails, ears tuned to vocal fractures—and her contradictory impulses (defiance vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously as she carves. The micro-choice to climb sideways, not toward the spire, crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost (bleeding fingers). The arc from sly poem-slipping to public sabotage is earned; only the final “heart lighter” feels slightly abstract, a hairline slip after such embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to repair while craving surrender—are dramatized in scene: the trembling hand, the decision to speak aloud to the void, the final step into the statue’s grip. Each micro-choice is rooted in the established flaw of doubt, and the renunciation is earned by the prior accumulation of failed mends. Cost is visible in the dissolution of the workshop and the literal unspooling of “half-finished repairs.” Interiority avoids label-speak; doubt is shown through mercury-warped reflection, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief-sealed interiority is concrete and particular; the painted shell as grief-vessel shows embodied contradiction. His final renunciation (burning the quay paintings, stepping into the pool) is earned by the cave’s charged return of his mother’s image. The “intimately aloof” trait is dramatized when he drinks the salt-promise water and feels known yet outside village time. Micro-choices (pressing shell into motionless water, later drinking it) visibly reweight his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly textured—micro-choices like rolling the cork or inhaling salt-laced lavender embody his mother’s creed without exposition. Contradictory impulses (prove whispers / fear ridicule) coexist in-scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of the cork itself. Harkin’s softening is credible because the object’s pulsing warmth is dramatized, not declared. The only hairline slip is “throat ached with the effort,” a stock somatic cue amid otherwise fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s grief-riven vocation is vivid—her body remembers charts while her hands build “maps of string and nail.” Interior contradiction pulses when the bronze warms yet offers no answers, grounding her flawed hope. The midnight calls force micro-choices (answering, translating riddles, dialing out) that visibly cost her sleep and solitude, earning the ending’s lighter chest. Motivation stays character-bound; no diagnostic labels, only salt-stung ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s “twitch” and the deliberate choice to bite, scent, and bury the eye ground his arc in embodied, contradictory impulse; the renunciation costs him the relic’s possible power and seals his sister’s leap in earned stasis. The empathy-virus backstory is anchored to present micro-choices (he can’t lie so he occludes), but the sister’s suicide is recounted not dramatized, slightly muting the motivational torque. Still, interiority stays concrete, flaw-driven, and the final quiet is fully paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s compulsive noticing of absences (third-piling gouge, lavender scent) makes his eccentricity observable, not merely labeled. The moment he steels himself to steep the flower, then re-pins it, dramatizes a hierarchy of values: duty to strangers > self-protection. Interior contradiction is alive—he both clings to and surrenders the memory—yet never slips into diagnostic speak. Final renunciation costs him the flower and the stranger’s echo, foreclosing any future custodianship; cost is visible in the crumble promised by dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—antique-map dealer habits, the foxfire burn, the unbroken whisper of a younger self. Contradictory impulses (empiricism vs. uncanny pull) stay active in-scene, culminating in the costly choice to follow the child’s sob. Missing: a second on-page character to test status; thus relationship bullets n/a. Motive progression is legible, but the “promise” is back-loaded, softening the early causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The queen’s interior contradiction—sovereign duty versus childhood pact—is dramatized in the grotto; the final surrender is foreshadowed by her refusal to answer the priest’s scroll, so the cost feels earned. Embodied emotion (“bones hummed with the weight of stars”) keeps the epiphany physical, not therapeutic. No second character on the page, so relationship/status bullets waived; single-POV interiority stays coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his palm against the warm railing… the pulse… beneath”), and the shell’s revaluation from souvenir to key lands as a micro-choice that costs him his previous identity. The mentor-memory and cliff-memory are cleanly anchored to present tactile cues, so the 30 %-plus reflection stays within the allowed ceiling. What keeps the score sub-8 is that the final renunciation (“giving back—differently”) is stated more than dramatized; we see the laugh and the drop, but not the moment he pays the concrete price of letting the bottled suns go. Liora’s status shift from shadow-watcher to hand-clasp partner is legible, yet her interior remains opaque, muting the relationship-as-crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The two Elias-instances function as one fractured psyche; contradictory impulses (“be the chronicler” vs “burn the scrolls”) collide in-scene, embodied in trembling hands and dilated pupils. The final renunciation—handing over the scroll, accepting erasure—pays the cost of identity-dissolution without therapeutic self-talk. Jealousy toward past selves is shown through tactile memory (blackberry wine, ceiling constellations) rather than diagnosis, grounding the interior split. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: preserve narrative > preserve self > preserve continuity; each slot costs the next.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s synesthetic substitution of “weight-of-objects” for lost scent is vivid, but his final sketch of the woman’s hands is the first visible, choice-driven micro-action that costs him something (time, professional detachment). Interiority stays concrete—gear-oil under nails, fog on glass—never drifts into perfume-therapist jargon. The contradiction between a healer who cannot heal himself and a repairer who repairs understanding is alive in every beat. Only the woman lacks a second layer of motive; her tremble is shown but not tied to a prior want or fear, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, the deliberate press of quill to pulse—yet the arc pivots on an epiphanic beat (“runes bloom”) whose emotional cost is asserted more than dramatized. The contradiction between fear and exhilaration is present but blurs in the final paragraph’s celebrative rush, muting the scar-tissue payoff. Micro-choices (carving into stone, anointing skin) are specific and stake-shaping, earning the high-8 band; a hair more friction in the final self-forgiveness would have tipped 9.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vocation and regret are vivid, but the apology’s cost is more asserted than dramatized in her body; the final shovel pass is the first physical risk she takes. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward packaged lyricism (“weight of every unsent letter”) that flattens contradiction. Elias’s tremor and acceptance register, but his emotional hierarchy stays off-stage; we never feel what forfeiture hurts him most. Still, the pair’s shared silence carries enough earned history to lift the arc above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—goggles cracked, key worn smooth, pulse roaring—and his contradictory dread/curiosity is on-stage while he turns the key. The micro-choice to release the key at climax is earned by the prior bleed of the ship and the father’s dictum, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Flaw: the “gatekeeper” self-relabel is slightly overt; still, the embodied emotion and flawed hesitation keep him credibly human.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s grief-anchored need to “listen differently” propels every beat; her tactile micro-choices—thumb brushing the laser button, leaving the scanner—embody the shifting stakes. Interior contradiction is alive when she simultaneously seeks control (mapping) and surrender (letting data flow). The final renunciation costs her a prized tool and an identity, earned by the prior causal chain of failed hospital monitoring vs. fungal conversation. One-step-short of 8.0 only because the sister’s death is summarized, not dramatized, softening the visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s interior contradiction—obey the recovery edict vs hunt for stochastic answers—beats live on the page: she fingers her father’s textbook, lights the lantern, chooses the path he would reject. The micro-choice "let the contradictions hold her" crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses the safe-daughter path with stinging palms as visible price. Voice stays idiosyncratic (probability-as-religion) and avoids diagnostic self-talk. Earned gamble: she steps into the blue fracture, paying uncertainty for authority over her own model of luck.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his need to stay hidden versus his compulsion to answer—are enacted in-scene through the micro-choice of lifting the receiver again. The glass disc becomes an embodied extension of his regret, its vibrations literalizing his interiority. His final renunciation (“Try again tomorrow”) costs him the illusion of control, foreclosing the fantasy that he can ever leave the tunnel. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; even “melodically haunted” is voiced by the caller, not diagnosed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“steeped the memory…until the bitterness became part of her”), but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final stance is continuation, not renunciation. Micro-choice is present—tracing the photo onto vellum—yet the cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature lifts her above stock grief.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—her “grin of desperate jocularity” shows contradiction under pressure—but the promised “elusive logistician” never once deploys a believable professional tactic; the rock is passed along by rumor, not logistics. The final renunciation lands with felt cost, yet her competence feels writer-ordained rather than job-trained.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is sensorially embodied and character-specific; grief is mapped through synesthetic language rather than labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the bone, carrying silence—earns its cost via the long dowsing quest and the absorbed sorrow-copper taste. One hairline slip: “his blindness had been a kind of sight” edges toward tidy epiphany, but the next line immediately re-grounds the insight in the oak bark under his fingers, keeping contradiction alive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to “data” while doubting the reality of his own ink—remains vivid and embodied; the meteorite pen and anomaly act as externalized flaws that force his final micro-choice to plant again. The arc earns its quiet renunciation of “correction” through prior beats: wrong seeds, dried pen, rewritten constellations. Cost is felt: the observatory’s hum settles in his ribs, the vellum rests like a second heartbeat—concrete somatic price for the shift from editor to listener. No other characters appear; single-POV modesty holds.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s embodied signing of “forgotten songs” gives concrete interiority; Liora’s camera-stance crystallizes her quiet charisma under threat. Contradictory impulses—map vs. disrupt, remember vs. consume—play out in simultaneous micro-choices (lunging toward the faceless singer). The earned cost is legible: the camera’s new weight forecloses casual nostalgia. Minor slip: “quiet charisma” is once label-speak before it is staged.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—rescue/erase, create/destroy—are alive in every beat; the final match is the earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“volcanic tenderness erupting”) and never diagnostic. Micro-choices (key turn, ledger burn) trace a clear value hierarchy. The vandalized portrait as self-map is a flawless externalization of flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic drumming, the lagoon as emotional mirror, the quiet, embodied rebellion—yet the moment she pivots from sabotage to release (“she began to sing”) feels slightly epiphanic, not fully pre-seeded by contradictory desire. The earned cost is legible in the final image of her mind “finally quiet,” but the prior beats lean on lyrical summary rather than dramatized micro-choice, so the renunciation is credible, not irreversible. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page other), so the crucible is internal; that holds, but limits upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s gait-reading obsession is lived-in: every crunch of gravel couples to an embodied judgment that later lets him track the woman without exposition. The contradictory impulses—guarded skepticism versus the coin-metaphor gamble—collide in the single beat when he flips the coin, not to decide but to *perform* refusal of force. Micro-choice hierarchy is crisp: silence over shout, listening over seizing, yet the woman’s disappearance proves the cost of that stance. Closure leaves him unpaid, still listening; the endurance is earned because the story never soft-sells the quiet as safe, only as durable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The guardian’s absolute silence and ritualized weaving create a compelling, consistent interiority; her micro-choices (mirror tilts, shutter patterns) externalize contradictory impulses without spoken exposition. The boy’s trembling hands and delayed exhale embody shame under pressure; his decision to drop the note feels causally rooted in the star-pattern rite. No therapy-speak or stock labels; every gesture is character-specific. Relationship shift lands with visible cost: the father’s unclenched shoulders mirror the boy’s lighter stride—earned stasis for both.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet strategist persona is vividly embodied through tactile repetition—spectacles, pawn, filings—under pressure; the internal contradiction between teaching foresight and needing immediate rebellion is dramatized when he pockets filings that later “sing,” showing micro-choices that foreclose violence and cost him anonymity. Student relationships remain off-page, so status/relationship bullets do not apply; interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. Closure renunciation (no credit, no fame) is earned by earlier causal plant of humming filings; flaw (obsessive quietness) drives both tactic and final isolation, satisfying 9+ quick test despite limited cast.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s transformation from dockworker to whale is anchored in tactile memory and guilt; the scrimshaw pulses against his thigh as both talisman and trigger, making the final shift feel like inevitable self-recognition rather than magic. Interiority stays concrete—“bones hummed,” “lungs remembered a shape”—avoiding diagnostic labels. The only motivational thinning arrives in the single line “He’d stopped asking why,” which summarizes rather than dramatizes the surrender that precedes the call. Still, the earned cost is visible: the island dissolves behind him, a permanent forfeiture that seals the change.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—performer reflex vs post-Mandate stillness—propels every beat: the pocketknife, railing balance, bouquet discard. Embodied grief is precise (wood curls “like shed skin,” face “smooth mask”), never diagnostic. Final offer to teach whittling shows earned micro-choice that forecloses isolation with visible cost (shared relic). Moral ambiguity sits in her refusal to fake happiness; flaw complicates without safety-hedging. Only cap is single-POV default; no relationship crucible or status swing tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elira’s interiority is textured—her synesthetic merger with quartz, the kinesthetic “unspooling” of exile—but the turn from pilgrim to boundary-dissolver is declared more than dramatized; the final smile reads as authorial commentary rather than embodied cost. The elders’ fear is inferred, never personified, so her rebellion lacks a counter-force that would sharpen stakes. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp and the micro-choice to kneel at the thawing lake is a credible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s color-blindness and plant-messaging are vivid, embodied, and motive; his fear-of-silence interiority drives every micro-choice. The “cracked vase = perfect” beat crystallizes his flaw as strength. Liora’s desire to learn the language turns the relationship into a crucible that alters both states. One hairline slip: “he’d spent a lifetime learning to love them” is a touch expository just before closure, blunting cost by telling.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s inner contradiction—seeking a “texture of connection” while renouncing any final sound—drives every micro-choice; the moment she leaves the bell, the cost of relinquishing proof is felt in her bones. No stock therapy-speak; her grief is embodied in the warm lens and the vibrating hum she chooses to walk away from. The earned stasis is complete: she becomes the silence she once feared.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s grief-hardened inertia and the slow pivot from sealing memory in metal to releasing it via hollow cranes are rendered with embodied, tool-specific interiority. The contradictory pull to hoard vs. let go acts inside single beats (twisting wire / folding paper) and culminates in a credibly costly renunciation: she cedes control of the cranes to strangers, foreclosing her reliquary habit. Mentor memories are anchored to present tactile cues (vellum, copper petals) and tilt her choices on the page. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status pressures are N/A; headcount default waived cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “steady curiosity” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—laying tape across print-outs, aligning timestamps with arcana—each staining his fingers darker. The interior contradiction (cartomancer who distrusts superstition yet reverse-engineers belief) is alive in every beat, culminating in the earned laugh at the inverted Wheel: he accepts that rules are writable yet stays bent over the tape. No epiphany is declared; the cost is the indigo on his skin and the next crash he now must track. The only slack is the ex-quant woman: she projects loss but her own agency is off-page, so relationship pressure remains illustrative rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The historian’s interiority is lyrically particular—her refusal to “bind the past with logic” shows embodied contradiction—but the absence of a second on-page character caps relationship-as-crucible, and the final renunciation, while earned, is stated rather than dramatized with visible bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s perceptual signature (“dusk noticer”) is vivid and specific, grounding her interiority in embodied, sensory detail. The contradictory impulse to both guard and surrender her shadow is dramatized in the final beat, where the cost—her own shadow’s diminishment—is felt on the page. The curator’s lie adds relational pressure, but his interiority is kept modest, so status dynamics remain legible without POV leakage. The only slack is the poet’s off-page arc, which is summarized rather than witnessed, slightly diluting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictions—healer/con-man, trembling hands/steady care—are dramatized in every beat; the tail-repair micro-choices externalize the self-repair arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“tremor in his chest” vs. “steady fingers”). The final “balance” image is earned because the tail regrowth and the tincture gift are already on-page; no safety-hedging. Slight over-articulation of the “layers” metaphor keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulse—yearning to decode scars yet finally choosing to carry rather than read them—crystallizes in an embodied, costly renunciation. The scar on her collarbone remains warm, pulsing under her palm, a tactile price that drives the final stance. Interiority is concrete, character-particular, never diagnostic: “the ridge of it warm as if the knife had only just withdrawn.” Micro-choice of writing beside “unremarkable” rewrites her mother’s story and her own in one visible stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clairvoyant hunger vs. self-protection—pulse in every tactile choice (threading the reel, palming the crystal). The final renunciation lands because each micro-choice has stored him inside her ribs; the cost is the silence she now agrees to carry. Voice never slips into diagnostic speak; instead, “lyrics humming under her skin” bodies the feeling. Cap at 8.7 only because the off-page lover remains a cipher; his absence is intentional but limits relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the weight in her chest lightened”), but the transformational climax—her sudden ability to sing the stars free—reads as externally bestowed rather than earned by prior micro-choices, softening the cost and keeping her just shy of full contradictory-agency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hollow’s passivity—guarding, then merely cradling the spark—keeps the arc from tightening; the decisive act (winding the clock backward) is announced, not dramatized, so cost is felt but not earned in scene. Interiority is vivid, yet the contradiction between “never dreamed” and instant acceptance of timeline magic remains asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philosopher’s interiority is concrete and biased—his fingers twitch, the gear warms, laughter that isn’t his erupts. Contradictory impulses (wander vs. stay, explain vs. surrender) coexist in the same breath. The renunciation of the gear is earned: every prior beat ties the object to identity, so leaving it behind feels like amputation. Only the absence of a second character keeps this from the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—lifetime guide who never stayed—lands early and governs the final renunciation. The embodied micro-choice to punch her own palm crystallizes the arc, though the chorus of unnamed “others” diffuses relational pressure and slightly dilutes crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s numb arm, silent profession, and decision to stay fuse motive and action; the bolt transfer crystallizes a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction—duty to quiet vs need to hear—shows in micro-choices under pressure. The pianist’s burned, sewn face externalizes cost, anchoring Elias’s reversal. Final endurance (staying to listen) forecloses the silent escape path with on-page bodily price.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veythas’s long endurance and final whispered sacrifice land as credible renunciation; the interior contradiction between detachment and loyalty is implied rather than embodied in-scene, so the emotional cost reads slightly abstract. Micro-choices are present but filtered through lyrical exposition, muting the crucible effect. Still, the persistent refusal to act until the price is absolute aligns with his mountain-stone trait and lets the closure feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—her habit of tapping the *two-quick-one-slow* rhythm anchors every beat—but the contradiction between scientific duty and grandmother-myth never collides on the page; the moment she steps onto the impossible road, her choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. The torn atlas page is handled twice yet never becomes a tactile pivot in her hands; its emotional charge is asserted, not dramatized. Because the stakes leap from data-keeping to metaphysical pilgrimage in one sentence, we see no visible cost paid for abandoning protocol—no hesitation that costs her skin or信誉. What keeps this from the 9-band is the missing micro-choice where her rational self visibly loses.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s barefoot habit is more quirk than crucible; the opera glasses and stone hum drive her turn, not her soles. Interiority is vivid (“awkward certainty like a bird with one wing askew”), but contradictions under pressure are only implied, not dramatized in scene. The final stance—standing in the wreckage and refusing silence—earns its cost via the bay’s reignition, yet her flaw/mistake remains offstage. Closure lands as Charged Poise; motivation suffices but falls short of 8-band micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s contradiction—gardener-grandma obeying plants while defying Council—drives every micro-choice; her laugh in the mud shows cost paid in social ostracism. The amber crack is earned by telepathic labor, not epiphany. Flaws (insurgent streak, plant-obedience) directly enable victory and risk, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—grief’s pull to freeze versus the arboretum’s invitation to grow—are dramatized through the photograph release and leaf-pluck, each micro-choice priced with bodily pain; the interiority stays concrete, eschewing labels. Her quiet talent is shown via tactile gardening savvy, not told. The Earned Stasis closure (letting the photo go, pocketing the leaf) is fully motivated by prior somatic beats and carries visible cost—she forecloses nostalgia’s loop and accepts an unguarded future. No stock therapy-speak intrudes; every emotional label is earned through sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrically dense but drifts toward self-diagnosis (“Why do we cling…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final stance—surrender to the dark—reads more as poetic fiat than as a choice whose cost has been dramatized through prior micro-decisions. The character’s arc is affectively legible yet causally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “serene anger” is embodied early and carries through every beat; his decision to step through the ink is foreshadowed by the prior vanishing and the white streaks in his hair, so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete—his milky eyes “burn,” breath “curls like smoke,” fingers “curled into fists”—rather than label-speak. The only flaw is that the sister mention is a single, late sentence; the emotional cost is legible but not layered in earlier beats, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—compliance vs. truth—are dramatized in the warm-paper moment and the terminal keystroke; the smile under gunfire shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse scandalized the stillness”) and avoids label-speak. The martyr tag is external; her internal calculus is fully legible. Competence balanced with genuine jeopardy; no safe moral hedge.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—“thorns against her palm until the pain grounded her”—and her endurance carries a visible cost when she knots the sandbag strip round the sapling, renouncing flight. The father/backstory is cleanly cued by the canvas scrap and “Quiet, like the wind before dawn,” then paid off in her refusal to leave. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the renunciation is earned and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fisher’s cool-headedness is shown through embodied micro-choices—pressing silence into dirt, driving the spike without flinch—so the trait actively shapes the climax. Interior contradiction is kept off-page; the “lifetime learning which echoes to drown” is asserted rather than dramatized, capping depth. Daughter-memory is filtered through sensory triggers (river-reed scent) rather than label, keeping emotion earned. Final renunciation carries visible cost: he lets the last echo go, foreclosing reunion, so endurance is credibly paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lydia’s contradictory pulls—guilt, filial loyalty, investigative drive—are palpable in every micro-choice: cuff-link twist, ledger stroke, breath-fog on the dome. The embodied tremor when she reads “V. Estate” crystallizes internal conflict without label-speak. Her final decision to run the exposé costs her the last illusion of paternal integrity; the pen-nib’s warmth in her palm is the tangible price. Minor dock: the caretaker’s “new beginnings” toast is too generic, muting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven erasure vs. compulsion to witness—are etched into her skin and the amber she grips; every micro-choice (feeding the paper, pressing the cracked amber to the tattoo) externalizes the split. The final renunciation to “pay with witness” is fully earned by the causal chain of failed erasures and the firmware’s hunger. Interiority stays concrete: “static that coiled around her ribs,” never abstract self-diagnosis. The only friction is a hairline slip toward diagnostic shorthand (“she understood then”) immediately rescued by embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lior’s interior contradiction—whimsical label vs. hunger for forbidden memory—drives every micro-choice; the moment he pockets the burning flake we see motive crystallize. Social perceptiveness is shown (baker’s shake, blacksmith’s cracked laugh) not told, and it later lets him read the village’s buried doubts as they spill out. The final refusal to finish the mural path is Earned Stasis: he pays with ongoing outsider risk, foreclosing the elders’ clean slate. Flaw: we never feel the flake actually scorch flesh; “burned” stays metaphor, softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingers “tracing the chipped patterns,” the stone “warming beneath his touch”—and his contradiction (surgeon’s precision vs heretic compassion) is active in the moment of naming. The micro-choice to keep speaking Aisha’s name while the sword hovers is a charged, embodied risk. The commander’s instant conversion feels slightly under-motivated; a single preparatory beat (his hand already hovering near a tessera, or a visible tremor) would have locked the stakes. Still, Elias’s refusal to stop renaming earns the plaza’s answering glow, so the cost is visible and the path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lydia’s contradictory pull toward the stage while dead is embodied in synesthetic hallucinations; her choice to hand Elias the coin costs her visibility and anchors the timeline repair. The micro-choice to “intertwine fingers with branches” physically enacts her stake and forecloses her lingering. Missing a hairline 9: Elias’s turn is slightly more observed than driven by on-page causality from his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s affectionate skepticism is vivid—she kisses the cat yet scoffs at horoscopes—driving her to press the geode to her temple despite risk; the interior contradiction is active, not labelled. The micro-choice to paint rather than step through the door crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she accepts belief because it matters, renouncing immediate transcendence to leave a light for Mira. Only minor slack: “gravity but not gravity’s intentions” is slightly aphoristic, and the cat’s presence never alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s interiority is vivid and embodied—glove-whir, heat-flare, breath-hitch all externalize contradiction. Motivation escalates cleanly from curiosity to rebellion to self-designation as “voice,” each step tied to tactile fossil contact. The final renunciation (stasis pods’ silence accepted) carries visible cost in the rain-drenched exit. Slight over-certainty in “They understood” moment keeps this off 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quietly resolute interiority remains consistent and specific—his calloused fingers, ledger code, and “second heart” jar anchor his voice. The contradictory pull between preserving communal time and relinquishing control is dramatized when he threads the ninth button and chooses to leave it as an offering, earning the renunciation with visible cost. Secondary presence is minimal, so relationship/status tests are waived; the micro-choices—cataloging, lowering the needle, tying the knot—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Flaws complicate rather than console, and the final refusal reads as individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. the dare to “finish it”—are alive in the moment she cracks the pillbox; the micro-choice costs her the safety of denial and is paid for with the key she pockets. The scarred face, misaligned eye, and coat of “silvered stains” give embodied history without exposition. One beat later the stakes recede into abstraction (“not for them. For the girl she’d been”), softening the cost and keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—decades of disciplined waiting versus the burning parchment that forces the crossing—plays out in embodied micro-choices (finger twitch, reins grip). The girl’s silent hand-off of the needle crystallizes a secondary pressure that alters his stance, earning the renunciation of turning back. Cost is felt but not scaled higher because the merchant’s wants remain off-stage and the girl’s motive is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)
    The potter’s interiority is concrete—“phototropic to kindness” manifests in his repeated return to the ruined oasis and in the tactile way he cradles the glass shard. His micro-choices—pressing the glass into wet clay, leaving the bowl among the hives—reveal a hierarchy of values (memory over safety, repair over abandonment) with visible cost. The bee’s landing and the thrum he feels dramatize an embodied, contradictory impulse between surrender and stewardship. The closing renunciation (walking away yet promising return) earns its credibility through these accumulated, object-anchored gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete—her thumb-blood pressed into soil, her quivering hands, her humming—yet the “wistfully pragmatic” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The gauge-tooth micro-choices credibly foreshadow the ending renunciation, and the Earned Stasis (choosing to stay & plant) carries visible emotional cost. Elias functions as pressure, not crucible; his smoother tooth gift is the pivotal external trigger that crystallizes her shift. No orientation or knowledge drift; competence balanced with believable tremor under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s guilt-born solitude and the bird’s mirrored isolation feed each other; the feather-offering beat crystallizes a credible, costly shift from penitent witness to self-forgiven exile. Interiority stays concrete—"etched into his ribs"—and the final micro-choice (letting the bird go) is proportionate to the 800-word arc. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ bar is missed, but motivation tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clutching versus surrendering the spiral—are dramatized in bodily micro-choices on the walkway and at the orb drop; the final decision to offer her own unsent letter costs her the safety of anonymity and is earned by the mirrored beat of the first spiral’s release. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers curled around a twig on her pillow”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The only minor softness is a slight therapeutic tint to “secrets were never meant to be kept,” but it is immediately complicated by the material act of returning, so the flaw stays sub-capsule.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her decade of muscle-memory dialing, the way her thumb “hovers” over the switch, the embodied ache in her teeth under alien pressure. Contradictory impulses (paranoia vs. scientific rigor) coil inside single beats. The final refusal to explain herself to the dean crystallizes an earned stasis with visible social cost. Only minor stretch: her overnight mastery of “subsonic counter-melody” edges on competence-porn, slightly softening struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s dread of enclosed space is viscerally embodied (“lungs tightened”) and drives the descent; the inherited compass and father’s tagline braid claustrophobia with legacy. The final choice to stab the key into the table crystallizes a hierarchy of values—legacy over safety—paid for by the instant spatial assault. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the beat of absolute panic is slightly under-played next to the lyric exterior. Still, the cost is legible and scales to word count.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied through tactile memory and the silver lance; the final beat—tucking the ribbon beside the sketched curve of her shoulder—shows a contradictory tenderness that costs him the comfort of forgetting. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. The only slip: “learning to carry the weight” is slightly abstract; a more embodied cost would clinch 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s ancestor-quest and instant willingness to test the threshold feel sharply motivated; every beat is filtered through his obsessive map-librarian eye. Internal contradiction is shown (isolation vs. hunger for legacy) rather than told. The renunciation of the journal and the felt hush of the closing door land as earned stasis with visible cost. Minor slip: “nervously confident” is named once but never dramatized in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s interiority is sensuous—thumb on glass, bow on river—but his want (“amnesty from never”) stays abstract; no contradictory micro-choice shows how the shard physically alters his risk calculus before he steps through. The climactic renunciation (“the bridge had nothing to do with it”) lands as label-only epiphany rather than embodied cost. Still, his perceptual signature—sound as topology—keeps the voice particular.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his father’s larceny itch vs. his own need to let go—surface in the tactile pocketing of the lira and the final flick of the cigarette; the gesture sequence shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete (“foreign money warm against his thigh like a secret he no longer needed to keep”) and avoids label-speak. The earned renunciation is legible, though the beat is compressed; a hair more bodily cost in the moment would have pushed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, the taste of petals and salt—but the “healing with words” gift is asserted, not dramatized; no scene shows him mending anyone. His micro-choice to release the ledger is earned, yet the sister remains a cipher, so the relational crucible is one-sided. Contradictory impulses (record vs. release) surface, but only in summary. Still, the final renunciation carries a felt cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eldrin’s contradictory impulses—stoic finder vs. brother-haunted man—are dramatized in the single kneel-plant gesture that costs him the frozen truth. The brother-jump revelation lands with visible cost: Eldrin is “pressed flatter than any blade,” a bodily flattening that externalizes the internal renunciation. Micro-choices (seed pressed, key pocketed) trace a hierarchy of values: truth > mercy > self. The only slack is the off-page warlock trick; we’re told, not shown, how that failure scars Eldrin, so the flaw stays sub-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s scars-as-compass is a vivid, body-specific motive; each burn/pull propels her steps. The interior contradiction—seeking a covenant she once ignored—keeps tension alive. Yet the older-self encounter swaps concrete micro-choice for visionary exposition, slightly blunting the final cost. Still, the earned bloom of the silver-leaf scar sells the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “brushing,” her smile “just a little”—and the barter of her guilt for a flower is embodied and costly. The contradictory impulse to give everything yet “take something back” crystallizes in the final beat. Veyra functions as living warning, but the relationship is static; no power shift. The micro-choices (needle, stitch, release) track a believable hierarchy of values; the self-forgiveness feels earned because the orchard literally extracts the child’s name.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liam’s contradictory impulses—cataloging facts vs. craving meaning—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the cloth; the final pocketing is a credible renunciation of appraisal logic with felt cost in the steady breath he accepts. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak. The “confidently uncertain” tag is shown, not told, through micro-choices like tracing the hem and refusing to price the scrap. Secondary characters supply brief pressure only; widow memory is summary, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief-pressed curiosity and methodical habits are concretely rendered through tactile beats—brass magnifier, sap stylus, two-day climb—while the interior contradiction (yearning for the lost voice yet mistrusting it) stays active in scene. The final choice to return is credibly foreshadowed by his translator’s reflex to “trace the shape of transition,” so the renunciation carries visible cost. Secondary pressure is minimal (no on-page relationship crucible), and the wife’s reappearance is more closure device than character tension, capping the score just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—cataloguing loss while feeding wonder—are present in gesture, but the moment of interior conflict is narrated rather than dramatized. The final renunciation (“You’re already in the creel”) is foreshadowed yet feels lightly earned because the ledger/crucible beat is summarized, not pressured. Micro-choices are visible (dial-twist, palm-to-creel) but do not visibly narrow options or accrue cost on the page. Emotional embodiment is strong in the bone-light ache and fog-breath question mark, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s interior contradiction—duty vs. empathy—drives every micro-choice; the pearl’s absorption of confessions is embodied in trembling fingers and softened stone. The final renunciation (no radio answer, walking into light) is earned by the causal chain of shells and the felt cost of “every confession became her own.” Only the slightest safety-hedge—“wasn’t entirely hers”—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—self-accusation versus the need to keep moving—stay alive in every beat; the final renunciation of looking back is earned by the long walk and the bellows’ creak, not by an epiphany. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “the fog had started to feel like a second skin” shows medication withdrawal as lived texture. Micro-choices (tracing the map, squeezing the silent bellows, turning right) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only bar to 9+ is the absence of a second on-page character to test status, but within single-POV scope the arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is concrete—her pulse quickening, gloves trembling, the watch burning—yet her contradictions (needing to “document” words while letting the library dissolve her own veils) remain more asserted than dramatized. The final choice to write a third letter is earned by the watch’s theft of her own silences, but the cost is stated (“the watch…unraveling *her*”) rather than felt in body or breath. Still, micro-choices ladder cleanly from cipher to confession, making the arc legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motives—freedom vs. stewardship—are legible and intensify; the prick-of-thorn gift is shown, not told. The violin-touch micro-choice crystallises her hierarchy of values. Final renunciation carries visible cost (thorn-blood, dirt under nails). Interiority stays lush but never explanatory; one “she understood” tag is the lone cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora’s interiority remains concrete—her fingers “tracing the ridge where the stone curled like a sleeping eyelid” shows body-first knowing, not label-speak. The beautician/mortician duality is evoked through tactile ritual (preparing a corpse, reading static) rather than exposition. Internal contradiction surfaces in her need to hoard sparks for the dead while sensing her own pulse as rhythm not countdown—an earned micro-shift. Cost is present but diffuse: the chip’s light is “spent,” yet the price to her own future stillness is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maren’s contradictory impulses—clinging to grief while seeking pre-creation—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the hairpin into soil, plucking the twilight shoot). The final gesture of giving the silver fruit to the arsonist crystallizes her earned, costly compassion; her interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and carries visible scars that inform every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s interiority is consistent and embodied—his fear of “edges,” the trembling fingers, the decision to wave back—but the “conscience-for-hire” premise is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see a single client negotiation or price paid, so the sponge metaphor feels abstract. The decisive change (accepting uncertainty) is legible and earned, but the visible cost is diffuse—thread-dissolving is poetic rather than visceral. Interior contradiction is present yet muted; the final stance crystallizes but doesn’t quite sear.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s reverse-aging is vividly embodied (knuckles soften, hip pain dissolves), but the only on-page choice is dropping a final stone—an action identical to the earlier, off-page instance with the student. No new contradiction or sacrifice is forced by the climax; the epiphany is declarative (“where you learn to be seen”) rather than dramatized through a fresh micro-choice that costs him something tangible now.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skimmer’s interiority is vividly embodied—his fingers “tracing the edge,” the arrowhead “worn smooth by generations of palms”—and his refusal to flee crystallizes into Earned Stasis with visible cost: he becomes “a tower,” pulse-anchored, bones vibrating. The contradiction between immobility and agency is dramatized, not told. Flaw: no second character means status/relationship bullets don’t apply, but single-POV depth is strong. Still, the final self-transformation is credible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marlin’s “stubbornly glowing candle” gives him a concrete, quirky signature; interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers numb, robes stiff with frost”). Internal conflict—yearning for the sacred vs. institutional failure—stays active in scene. Final refusal to explain flicks the deans’ authority away, an earned renunciation whose cost is the keystone he leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession with “the color of sound” is embodied in every sensory beat; the lantern release is a visible micro-choice that costs him his former silence. Interior contradiction is shown, not told: curiosity vs. fear as he pockets the key tag while the tide gnaws the wreck. The final stance—standing alone with a lantern whose flame carries hues “he had no name for”—crystallizes earned stasis; we feel the path foreclosed. Flaw: the leap from “sound has color” to “I must open this door” is slightly under-causal, preventing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s quiet-pattern obsession is embodied in her palm-press to glass and trembling fingers; the final choice to “turn around” is earned by the spiral of coins that reweights her prior forward-chase. Interior contradiction is present but thin—no simultaneous impulse to flee the invitation—so the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Still, the atom-by-atom dissolution supplies enough embodied price to satisfy the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The reaper’s contradictory motives—his self-inflicted hollowness versus the compulsion to name others’ fears—are dramatized through the tactile act of pressing terror-shapes into monsters. His “heart had been the first thing he’d reaped” crystallizes a prior, off-stage choice that now costs him the capacity for regret, a renunciation that charges the final image. Micro-choices (pressing the spire into Leviathan, rolling the atlas into his rib-hollow) visibly foreclose paths: he can neither undo the naming nor carry remorse. The only soft spot: we never see the moment he decides to continue after the atlas warns “You’ll regret this”; the decision is elided, slightly blunting the causality of the final march.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is rich—his self-diagnosing “lukewarm” magic, the embodied tremor when drips stutter, the micro-choice to listen for silence rather than sound. His stubborn, math-soaked devotion is shown through tactile bell-handling and bloodied fingers, not labeled. The only slack is the single sentence of village label “earnestly naive” without on-page contradiction; still, his final refusal to claim heroism crystallizes the arc with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guardian of the drowned town vs. hungry to feed it—are dramatized in embodied beats (nailing then burning photos). The final renunciation of the bottle and the shift from warden to son are earned by the chain of photograph choices; cost is visible in the sinking bottle and the last ember. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding label-speak. The “precisely humane” trait is shown, not declared, in the delicate way he releases scent and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Auburn-haired alchemist’s interiority is vivid—“spent a lifetime disguising it as rigor”—and the renunciation of the flower-pressing girl is embodied in the blue-fire transit. Contradictory impulses (rigor vs. wonder) coexist in scene, but the final step through the door is slightly under-motivated; we are told she “knew” rather than shown the micro-choice that tips her. Still, the sentimental flaw visibly costs her her past identity, satisfying earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers on worn brass, heartbeat as clock—while her contradictory twin imperatives (trust no one / preserve trust) tighten every choice. The micro-choice sequence *left-right-pause-twist* dramatizes her hierarchy of values under pressure and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the buckle’s weight on wrist and pocket, the boot-prints she leaves behind. Only the twelve-year gap in the mentor’s voice is asserted, not dramatized, a hairline unmotivated leap.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s split-mind numbness is shown through gesture—shallow breath, finger on glass—rather than label. The jars act as externalized interiority, giving us two silent “selves” whose pulse he reads like a polygraph. Veyra’s single line of dialogue forces status shift and crystallizes stakes. Only lapse: the merge pain is summarized in one clause, muting the embodied cost that could have cemented the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet persistence and Lina’s receptive tilt feel lived-in; the seed prompts visible micro-choices. Interiority stays concrete—steam curling, hand warmth, cross-legged vigil—never drifts into label-speak. The final hand-squeeze crystallizes a credible, low-key relationship shift with cost: the business slows, the stench arrives, they stay. No contradictory impulses in scene, so the 9+ quick test narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-borne need to “conduct” laughter is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—each pull-cord yank—so motive stays embodied. The moment he lowers the blower and climbs to the door, the renunciation is earned; we feel the tool’s abandonment as his own withdrawal from ghost-proxying. Interior contradiction is vivid: mournful vs. eager keeps surfacing in bodily tension rather than label-speak. Only the child’s instant recognition (“Uncle Elias!”) feels slightly convenient, trimming the flawlessness needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyssa’s guardian identity is vividly embodied—crouching, tracing frost on a book, pocketing the pendant all reveal keeper vs. prisoner tension. Interiority stays concrete (“teeth ache,” “time slippery”) and her final laugh under threat shows contradictory fear/relief. The renunciation—handing over the key—carries visible cost: the garden unravels and she surrenders her known world. Micro-choices (salvaging the book, wearing the pendant, waiting, surrendering) align with her flaw of obsessive vigilance and foreclose her custodial path.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—self-loathing versus world-breaking curiosity—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (feeding the crozier memories, slamming it into the heartstone). His interiority stays concrete, never drifting into diagnostic jargon. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: the guild flees, his unmarked hands now capable of “splitting the sky,” a charged poise that forecloses return to exile. Flaw: the moment of doubt ingestion is summarized, not fully embodied; a hairline slip keeps him just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to decode yet forced to unlearn—drives every beat; the jump is not a stunt but the earned release of gravity-as-assumption, paying the cost of her mentor’s creed in one crystallized gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s wry, practiced calm under multi-dimensional pressure feels lived-in; the hourglass-as-vacuum neatly externalizes her vocation. Micro-choices (flipping the glass, kneeling to press it to deck) show hierarchy of values—ferry first, self second. “Next stop, the one after this one” crystallizes her earned stasis with smiling cost. No interior contradiction in scene keeps her from 9.0, but resilience never wobbles, so struggle reads slight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s obsession is palpable in the sinew-thread micro-gestures, but his interiority drifts toward abstract pronouncements (“proving they were never ours”) rather than embodied contradiction. The woman’s fractal irises and cryptic warnings function more as oracle than second character, so relationship pressure is only implied. Renunciation at the end is signaled, yet the cost feels transferred to the anonymous crowd rather than personally paid by Elias, softening the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s “balancedly curious” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—testing the chain in the crevice, chalking the star map—so the curiosity drives visible beats rather than label. Internal contradiction is lightly dramatized (anchor from the surface world now becomes the lever to leave the abyss), giving her a credible, non-therapy-speak arc. The final “warm chain” image crystallizes renunciation of the city’s old stance; cost is felt in the elders’ implied abandonment. Voice stays crisp and ocean-instructor specific; only minor shortfall is Kael’s function—he questions but never pressures, so relationship-as-crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s curiosity trait is concrete—he follows the ghost signal into the atrium despite knowing it’s outside protocol. The moment he touches the glove and sees his own child-face, contradictory impulses (terror/recognition) collide on-page, forcing a renunciation of his former “only the living” stance. Cost is legible: he kneels, the aid dies, and he accepts dual clientele. Interiority stays specific to him; no stock labels intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s fear-of-small-places is announced not embodied; we never feel lungs tighten or shoulders scrape. Interiority is evocative—“the weight of the earth above him was a living thing”—but still abstract. The climactic decision to return is credible because the text has tethered his identity to retrieving lost voices; the cost is the blue droplet that dies in his palm, a quiet forfeiture that lands.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lena’s heartbeat-counting obsession is lived-in: the teacup shard is rubbed smooth, her pulse syncs with the radio void, and the final surrender to the observatory’s rhythm feels inevitable. The bureaucratic ghost of her own death certificate fuels every micro-choice—she pulls files, deciphers ink, stays—because the error is existential, not clerical. Interiority stays concrete: breath fogs porcelain, ink clings like cold, the shard warms only after she accepts the ghost’s offer. The ending’s Earned Stasis—she stops trying to erase the error and joins the chorus—pays off every prior compulsive count with visible cost: the once-sharp edge now blunt against her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s hunger to translate texture into sound is vivid, but her interior contradiction—knowing the danger yet pressing on—is told rather than shown in body. The final cost is felt: she becomes the echo, copper frozen, voice stolen. Yet the micro-choice that tips her from caution to fatal answer happens off-beat; the diamond warms, but we don’t see the precise instant she decides to speak the name. Still, the inherited flaw and the bodily price keep the arc credibly tragic.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s bitterness-to-joke arc is legible; the arrowhead-seed choice crystallizes his renunciation. Yet interiority drifts into lyric commentary (“bitterness had become his religion”) rather than embodied contradiction under live pressure. Emotional states are announced more than dramatized until the final laugh. Motive coherence survives, but micro-choice granularity is thinned by the poetic overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete, body-anchored (“her bow trembling against the strings,” “bare feet sinking”); the locust shell pressed to her chest turns heartbeat into tactic, showing contradictory impulses (memories of old wonder vs mechanical present). Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: she risks statue detection to play, then chooses to plant the shell—cost is felt when statues dissolve and bridge cables fray. Final renunciation (leaving violin, walking into grove) earns its stasis through prior causal build; flaw is slight over-reliance on lyric summary in two lines that could be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory mix of duty and law-breaking is embodied in micro-choices (testing the drone gap, stroking the scar). His internal split—wanting to heal the world yet courting danger—drives every beat. The final renunciation of permanent safety is earned because earlier beats show the cost of his “respectful rebellion.” Interiority stays concrete; flaw and value hierarchy are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lior’s muteness is embodied through tactile work and listening; the final “song” of gesture earns the shift. Interiority stays concrete—wood grain, halo warmth—yet the scar-woman functions more as oracle than crucible, muting relationship pressure. Micro-choices (pulling fragment, shaping air) visibly trace value hierarchy. Cost is felt: silence becomes door, but woman’s vanish skips concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession with the scarf and the “place where stories live” is vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to read the blank spaces aloud is a clean, costly pivot. Interiority is specific—spectacle-adjusting as habit, tea tasting of chalk—never generic. The mother’s voice rising from the scarf gives a credible external pressure that forces his stance shift. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship-as-crucible unlit, capping just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s interior contradiction—duty to return dreams vs. the ache to let them live—drives every beat; her micro-choice to whisper “Stay” while pressing the photo to her chest crystallizes the arc with visible cost (the footprint smear, salt-damp pillow). Emotions stay embodied in ink-stained fingers and prism-flare, never slipping into label-speak. The refusal to re-shelve the dream is earned by the prior failed exposures and the woman’s plea, so the renunciation feels inevitable, not convenient. Flaw: we never sense how this hunger began—no single memory or scar—so the trait feels more assigned than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“crookedest pick forged from a meteorite’s splinter”), but the locksmith’s contradictory impulses stay largely off-stage until the final quiet renunciation; embodied emotion is strong yet the decisive change costs are more atmospheric than corporeal, keeping her just shy of the 8-band where a visible price would bite on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s curiosity is dramatized through wading into black water, pressing the mushroom to his temple—embodied, risky. The memory gaps and their visceral cost (lost star, hollowing self) create interior contradiction. Final refusal to flee and the star-sewing choice crystallize his hierarchy: knowledge over safety. Missing: a second character to pressure status, so relationship crucible untested; still, solo arc earns credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elspeth’s nervous habit and shard-mirror gift create a credible interior; Kael’s tremor and tea-reading apprenticeship feel earned. Their mentor-protégé status tension is legible, but the emotional stakes hinge on abstract “shadow-door” peril rather than personal loss, blunting cost. Micro-choices—Elspeth pressing the shard into Kael’s palm—advance the bond, yet Kael’s interiority is filtered through Elspeth’s gaze, limiting contradiction. Relationship changes state (trust bestowed, fear confronted), satisfying crucible demand, but the absence of visible consequence to either character caps full believability.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s hunger-to-shape is shown through tactile grafting and the knife-hum against his thigh; the final self-wonder (“what might grow him”) is a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—“juice thick, electric” rather than labels. One hairline slip: the girl’s “They fade here” leans toward exposition, not embodied perception, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—restorer vs. releaser—are dramatized in the moment he drops the needle; the smile that “fit” is a credible, embodied renunciation. Interiority is concrete and salt-stung, never diagnostic. The moment he winds the threads round his wrists the cost is visible; the arc is earned. Only minor reserve: we never learn why *he* personally needs the spirits freed, so the motive plateaus at “town conscience” rather than private stake.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision mapper vs. intuition listener—drives every beat. The final refusal to step through until she “first would listen” crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge before self-preservation. Cost is felt: she walks out with no proof, only bone-level hum. Micro-choices (threading the third reel, palm to pillar) are concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Liora’s analytic nature is dramatized in the way she handles the globe and files the lie, but her interiority drifts into label-speak (“physics of letting go”) and the sister photo is pure exposition; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, and the final “letting go” is asserted rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The balladeer’s interior contradiction—translator of silence who now must choose to *absorb* or *release* the ghost-code—peaks when the bolt-plate sears his palm. His micro-choice to encode the “rest” symbol and slam the plate down is the earned pivot: it costs the ghost its exit and costs him the weight of unspoken songs. Emotion is embodied (heat, raw throat) without label-speak. The final image of boot-prints that *aren’t* there shows the sustained price under an Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s warmly inquisitive nature is shown through concrete micro-choices—tracing initials, exhaling on the goggles, unfolding the diary corner—each tied to the lens of extracting joy from isolation. The interior contradiction between seeing the spire as prison versus lens is dramatized in-scene, not declared. The final laugh is earned by the prior pattern of data-collection-as-love, so her endurance carries visible cost. Secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucible is N/A; no competence amnesia or diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-anchored obsession with sky-memory is palpable; every beat of cloud-seeing is a micro-choice that externalizes loss. The final surrender is credible because the text has tethered his vocation to mourning from line one. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the brass telescope functions as embodied memory. Cost is visible: he lets the gondola fall, trading control for fusion with the sky-archive.

    The artist’s compulsion to capture what can’t be held is lived-in: her fingers “twitching with the muscle memory of a thousand failed portraits,” the blank final page, the refusal to carve again. Contradictory impulses—obsessive detail vs. acceptance of blur—coexist in every beat; the renunciation is foreshadowed by the failed coin-mirror and paid in her emptied palms. No stock therapy-speak; even “fractally precise” is delivered as guild mockery, not self-diagnosis. The smile she never catches becomes the invisible portrait she finally paints—an earned stasis whose cost is the hush she now inhabits.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s “diligently curious” label is shown, not told: she trespasses, sketches the glowing cracks, and convinces the captain. Interiority stays concrete (“the words hummed in her ribs”). One contradiction—rule-fear vs. sky-lust—drives every choice. The micro-choice to trace the hopscotch sequence directly unlocks escape, so agency and flaw are locked together with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The locksmith’s drive to “mend what moonlight broke” is concrete, embodied, and tied to every gear she handles; interior contradiction surfaces when her own grief for her sister collides with the compulsion to repair time itself. Micro-choices—kneeling in salt-stiffened boots, whispering to a stubborn gear, reaching into black water—reveal a hierarchy of values where familial love outweighs self-preservation. The final image of the pocket watch warm against her ribs shows earned change: she becomes the key, renouncing her old identity as mere mender. No safety-hedging; flaws (obsessive precision, emotional tardiness) actively shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is lyrically sketched but never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse under pressure; her “yes” to the orchard arrives pre-approved, so the final “We stay” feels like confirmation, not costly renunciation. Kael’s ghost edges toward stereotype of benevolent guide; his flicker is poetic but doesn’t force Liora into a choice that hurts. The collective turn from strangers to family is summarized across weeks, so the relational crucible stays off-stage and the personal cost stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s three-decade vigil over the doomsday clock is conveyed through weathered hands, dimmed eyesight, and the quiet tremor of his micro-choice to cradle the puppet head; contradictory impulses (duty to stall vs. ache to release) coexist in the single present-tense moment. The final surrender is paid for by every prior stutter of the clock, so his smile at dawn carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the lullaby memory arrives as embodied sensation, not epiphany. Flaw is credible: his life is the flaw, and the story lets it stand without redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s reluctant caretaker persona is vividly embodied in her ritual precision (nut-carving, frost-timing) and the single, costly exception she makes for the freezing girl; her interior contradiction—yearning to guide yet fearing cost—drives every beat. The “offhandedly exact” trait is not label-only but enacted in the micro-choice of pressing nuts “just hard enough,” revealing a hierarchy of values under threat. No second on-page character means status/relationship bullets don’t apply, but the earned stasis—she keeps the last nut, accepts perpetual burden—lands with visible cost. Hairline slip: “graceless beauty” is asserted once rather than shown through gesture, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s interiority—engineering brain meeting grief—stays particular (“symphonically minded brain finally hearing the music”). The micro-choice to wade in and release the chrysalis crystallizes a decade of survivor-guilt and is paid for by the cold bite through boots: embodied cost on the page. Contradictory impulses (engineer’s urge to build vs. need to let go) act simultaneously inside one continuous beat. The girl’s arrival tests his new stance and he passes, proving the renunciation is real.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s calm, attentive stance is consistent and embodied; the micro-choice to accept moonlight for an unwritable absence shows a clear value hierarchy. Yet her interior contradiction (commerce vs. reverence for silence) stays static—no compounding error or visible flaw drives the final beat, so the renunciation feels preordained rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—needing to ingest grief yet fearing dissolution—drives every beat; the final “clean” tongue is embodied cost. Micro-choices (pouring the vial, lingering palm) reveal hierarchy: caretaker duty > self-preservation. One slip: “unburdened silhouette” is told, not embodied, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—quiet librarian vs. cultural midwife—are alive in her pockets (music slips, brass weight) and in her body-language at the tower. The micro-choice to engrave the trilingual weight is the hinge that turns Elias; it carries visible cost in time, risk of theft accusation, and social capital. Elias’s own arc from accusation to rough laugh is sketched credibly, but his interiority arrives late and leans on summary (“his father used to say”), so the crucible of their status shift feels more asserted than fully embodied. Still, both characters end credibly altered, and the flaw is not large enough to nick closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s “chaotically precise” micro-moves—finger on jagged glass, nanite pulse—embody interior contradiction and drive every beat; the final acceptance of entangled identities is foreshadowed by her earlier self-modifications, so the arc feels earned. Flaw: we never sense a moment where she might *not* go through with it; the risk of retreat is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost arrives more as lyric assertion than as forked choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysara’s grief for her brother, her “prism-mind,” and her refusal to confess to the elders create a credible interior contradiction that drives every beat; the moment she presses the smudge to flame and chooses to plant the seed, she crosses a visible threshold with cost. Interiority stays concrete—“the seed glowed between her ribs”—never sliding into label-speak. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single-POV default is met. Motive is rooted early (“Find where the combinations hide”) and escalates to the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test; a hair-slip of sentiment in “She hadn’t come for power” keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his need to hear vs. the world’s refusal to listen—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (strumming, pressing the insulator). His renunciation of taking the insulator is earned and costly, visible in the final image. Interiority is embodied, not diagnostic. Cap imposed because the insulator’s weeping glaze is slightly too magical; the cost is felt but not fully grounded in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—teacher of precision who questions the blood-drawn borders—drives every beat. The dented stone as tactile flaw-sensor embodies his need to translate silence into legible beauty; handing it to the girl externalizes the cost of that translation. Micro-choice hierarchy is vivid: he kneels to read earth-quivers instead of claiming victory, then renounces the board-edge he once taught. Earned renunciation lands with felt weight: the stone’s imperfection passed on, chest lighter than silence—palpable, scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is tactile and idiosyncratic—ink-stained fingers, humming copper, the diary as “pauses”—and his pacifism is tested in the final beat when he chooses to break silence, not merely catalogue it. The sketch of two hands and the fireworks-flinch dramatize contradictory impulses in-scene; the choice to open the guild stall is earned by prior pattern and carries visible social cost. Micro-choices (tuning the dial, tracing the sketch, scraping the chair) reveal a hierarchy of values without diagnostic label-speak. The only minor slip is the abstract phrase “weight of a hand finally uncurled,” which edges toward metaphoric convenience rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s hunger for serenity-through-sway is embodied in every micro-action (seed stolen, petal pressed into journal). Contradictory impulses—obedience vs. trespass—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation of stillness in favor of sway is earned by the corpse-flower mirror and costs her Elder approval; the tactile petal in the journal is the visible price. No safety-hedging: her flaws (obsessive precision, olfactory vanity) enable both the theft and the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“the hollows of the arches like a gathering of ghosts,” “whirling silence pressed against her eardrums”—and micro-choices (banking toward the fracture, landing, plunging her hand inside) track with her mentor-driven motive. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. legacy hunger) stay implicit rather than enacted in-scene, -0.2. Seed-taking is earned, the cost is the arrow’s dissolution into dust; still, no secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ gate on earned final choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s guilt-riven caution, tactile surveying, and final renunciation of the patch are embodied and costly; the “rapidly adapting” flaw is shown rather than labeled. Interior contradiction (intuition vs data) drives every beat. The torn sleeve ends as a scarlet flag of foresight renounced—visible, specific, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—obedient bell-ringer vs. aurora liberator—drives every beat; the moment she strikes the first chime “not to constrain, but to unfetter” crystallizes the hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is vivid (“colors coiled around her wrists, warm as living things”). The final renunciation costs her the elders’ protection and her own former identity, earned by the prior causal chain. Minor label-speak (“synesthetically blessed”) is the only thin patch.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulse—guardian reflex vs surrender—is dramatized in the fissure beat where he chooses to open the breach wider; the flute as tactile weight and the child’s touch embody the cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoided diagnostic speak. Thirty-year backstory is compressed into the bone-dust moment and a single micro-choice, so the scale fits. Flaw-driven mistake (unsealing) is the hinge; renunciation to follow rather than fight is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—collector of borrowed grief who refuses to be altered—drives every beat; the final surrender (“let them change him”) is visible, costly, foreshadowed. Micro-choices (pressing halo as die, releasing voices, crossing out his name) track the shift. The widow-silk voice and blacksmith-anger are embodied, not labelled. Only cap keeps it from 9: no second character on-page, so relationship crucible bullet is waived, not missing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courier’s trembling fingers and decade of withholding relics give him a lived-in interiority; the mentor-shaped absence drives every step. His micro-choice to pocket the broken clasp instead of clinging to it shows a believable shift from fear to custodianship. The woman’s cryptic power and instant vine-craft slightly tilt her into archetype, but her dissolve into roots keeps her from over-balancing the crucible. Cost is visible: he forfeits the pendant’s comfort and steps into the fade, a renunciation the prose lets us feel in his steady hands.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for proof yet fearing the cost—drives every beat; the prism throw is earned because earlier beats show him cradling, then flinching from, the glass. Embodied emotion is vivid: knees hit earth, palm bleeds, shoulders unknot. Micro-choices (touch frost, pocket prism, hurl it) trace a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only minor slip: “awful clarity of understanding” skirts diagnostic label-speak, but the next line cuts it with physical pain.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    The loom spinner’s interior contradiction—grief vs. the compulsion to keep weaving—is dramatized in her body (trembling fingers, teeth cracking amber) and in the loom itself as surrogate heart. Each micro-choice—cracking the bead, weaving through the night, hanging the tapestry—tracks a hierarchy of values: reunion > self-preservation. The final endurance (her bones in the roots) is earned by the prior causality that the message can travel only if the sender stays; the cost is scaled and felt. No therapy-speak, no label drift; voice stays coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The blacksmith’s interior contradiction—meek yet slow-burn defiant—is concrete from the first image of trembling hands wrapping silk; every beat in the shaft is filtered through his body (crushed-fruit smell, groaning ground against palm). The final moment of bending metal mirrors his own earned pliancy, the cost paid in spent silk and the audible “yes” from the planet. Quiet determination is never labeled again after line 4; it is dramatized by the inch-by-inch feed of silk into fissure and steady climb back into light. Voice stays singular; no other character on page, so relationship/status bullets correctly skipped.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s sensory-map interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between her compulsion to chase seams and her fear of erasure is dramatized in micro-choices (pocketing the shard, stepping through). The final renunciation—choosing to become the map—pays off earlier causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test. Minor slip: “the weight in her chest wasn’t fear” tells what the prior image already showed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete, pressure-grounded, and gains micro-choice traction (pocketing/keeping the glass, adding a stone). Flaws operate silently: his reticence is both shield and prison, compounding isolation. The final smile is earned—visible cost is the rotting skiff he lets go. Yet contradiction in-scene is more implied than dramatized; we glimpse, not feel, the internal split that makes the silence unbearable. Hairline slip keeps him just off 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority crackles—her laughter-as-weapon, the tactile memory of harbor blood, the micro-choice to let the wick dip toward drowning—each moment bodies her contradiction. The renunciation at the end (“You can’t have it,” followed by the climb she already foresees) locks a cost into her muscles; we feel the hours she’s already counting. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible doesn’t apply, yet her stance toward the village is a lived tension. Flaw complicity is total: she is both savior and storm-bringer, and the story lets that moral thorn stay embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dye master’s interior contradiction—yearning to understand the storyteller-heart’s pull while fearing its foreign rhythm—drives every beat; his embodied tremor at the wing and the ache in his chest are never abstract. Micro-choices (pinning the wing, stirring indigo, unfolding it in the square) all trace to this need, culminating in the earned renunciation of telling his own tales. The only minor slack: the “watchful” trait is declared rather than dramatized before the traveler speaks it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet, tactile caretaker persona is vivid; his micro-choice to “listen” by dismantling the sextant rather than repair it crystallizes a believable, idiosyncratic worldview. The interior contradiction—yearning to measure the immeasurable while accepting unmeasurability—stays embodied in mortar under fingernails and salt-fogged glass. Final endurance (returning the grief to the trees) costs him the instrument’s memory, so renunciation is earned. Could edge higher if the sorrow-transfer exacted an on-page physical price (bleeding palm, cracked nail) to make cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s grief-laced obstinacy is lived in every beat; her bleeding fingers and cracked voice make the cost visceral. Contradiction is shown, not told—terror of the method vs. bone-deep duty—until she surrenders to communal release. The final smile carries earned stasis: her solitary burden dissolves because she finally lets it, a renunciation charged by decades of prior isolation. Voice specificity slips once—“diagnostic” interiority that labels her own throat-burning—but not enough to shear the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s guilt-driven inertia and her empathetic curse are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing spines, pressing palm to bookcase). The final decision to lock the door is earned by the mirrored confrontation with Voss and the annotated thesis—cost is visible. Interior contradiction is present but slightly under-played in the staircase beat; still, the arc lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s “heuristically gentle” lens is dramatized via tactile micro-choices—planting mint under guard boots, pressing crumbs into soil—each revealing a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and contradiction-rich: she both craves answers and fears the price of seeing. The final hand-in-wheat gesture earns renunciation status because every prior beat linked observation to on-page risk. One hairline slip: “the sacred had always been here” flirts with label-speak, but the embodied image (crumbs, soil, weeping prince) immediately pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quietly obsessive interiority is consistent and embodied (“hands trembled” at the woman’s face). The ledger and slide anchor his micro-choices under pressure, and the final step onto the bridge is a credible renunciation of his lifelong measuring stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets don’t apply. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling—“knew the library’s time was running out”—that momentarily abstracts the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory mix of filial loyalty and calculated vengeance is embodied in the trembling fob and the soft, almost kind laugh; the micro-choice to withhold trust from Veyne crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—salt-bleached planks, anise breath—never drifting into label-speak. The ending’s Earned Stasis (letting the harbor take Veyne while she walks away) forecloses revenge as identity with visible cost: she’ll carry silence like the fob. One hairline slip: “curiously steadfast gaze” is told once rather than shown through a distinct beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied: the needle quivering “toward the taste of ozone on her tongue” makes skepticism visceral. The moment she tastes “the first breath of a planet waking up” her contradictory impulses—measurement vs. surrender—collide in real time, earning the transformation. The cost is palpable: the liquid-metal ring dissolving into her veins is a literal forfeiture of distance, yet the prior beats of empirical refusal make the surrender credible. Minor deduction: the shift from observer to storm-avatar is abrupt; one extra beat of embodied resistance would have sealed motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s mnemonic curse and stained fingers are dramatized through micro-choices—snapping charcoal, turning the dial to a memory-angle, smearing pigment on the rungs—so his shift from monochrome safety to feral color is earned. The contradiction between endless recall and lifelong avoidance is kept alive in scene, not summarized, and the final refusal to retrieve the lock enacts visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the embodied emotion ("the first stroke was a scream") is specific to him. Closure is a credible renunciation that forecloses the surface life with pigment-smeared breadcrumbs as residue.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s allergy to dishonesty is more than a gimmick: it warps his posture, dictates the inciting choice, and forces the final renunciation. The interiority stays concrete—ink bleeds where his breath dampens the page, fingers tremble, throat tightens—never sliding into label-speak. His decision to write ungilded truth inside the Archive is credibly costly: he returns plate-smooth, voice raw, lungs lighter, a physiological receipt for the change. Micro-choices (tucking the new fragment away, beginning again) crystallize a hierarchy of values—truth over comfort, craft over safety—without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s muteness-as-season, her tactile obsession with vibration, and the final smile of continuance all read as concrete, embodied, and particular. Interior contradiction is present—she both hoards and releases wonder—yet the text leans on lyric summary more than in-scene micro-choice under pressure, muting the cost. The absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets inert; still, her solitary ritual earns a credible renunciation. The arc satisfies the 9+ quick test but not with the visceral punch needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias-7’s contradictory mandate—preserve vs. destroy—peaks when he fingers the mirror shard, embodying the glitch. The static in his chest is never abstract; it’s the audible grind of servos resisting ignition. His micro-choice to wear the bloom behind the sensor, not clip it, crystallizes renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is sharply particular—her fingers dusty from thrift, the locket pressed to her ear—and her micro-choices (opening the mailbox, reading aloud) visibly tilt the courtyard’s collective stance. The “listen instead” imperative gives her a credible hierarchy of values under pressure. She earns no decisive personal loss, so the cost is communal, not intimate; still, her refusal to “solve” Elena is an earned renunciation that fits the communal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete—her bare feet reading the floor’s rhythm, her breath fogging the vial—and her contradictory impulse (to keep vs. to liberate) is acted out in the dance. The final renunciation (letting journals dissolve, dice sink) is earned by the prior cipher-work and carries visible cost: the lab becomes tomb, her skin the new manuscript. No stock phrasing; every emotional label is embodied. Micro-choices (rolling the dice, pressing palm to console) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern lighter’s grief-driven obsession is viscerally embodied—his pockets bulging with talismans, his hands steady even as the stone’s weight shifts. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. knowledge that “some things… were taken”) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—emptying pockets into the tide—carries visible cost and is causally earned by every prior micro-choice. Dockside status dynamics are absent, but the interior crucible is so tight that no external relationship is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s interiority is vivid—her hollow-eyed stare, the hush she weaves into a net, her cheek on the moss—yet her contradictory impulses (chase vs. hush) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in simultaneous beat-level tension. The final renunciation is earned: she pays with solitude, burnt skin, and the lighter paper, foreclosing further pursuit. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices (pressing the wing, lunging for the thread) are specific but could carry sharper cost-on-the-page immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s hunger to “understand” the brownstone is concrete from the first beat; the inherited-house grief and the way he palms bricks give interior contradiction. The final takeover moment—Elias knocking with sugar he doesn’t need—shows a visible, earned flip from seeker to keeper, paying the lie-cost. Veyra remains atmospheric more than internally conflicted, slightly capping the relationship-as-crucible potential, but Elias alone satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her fingers “testing for a pulse” in soil, the shell “half pressed to her ear”—and every micro-choice (burying the shell, offering the lily) externalizes her contradictory impulses: defiance vs. surrender, skeptic vs. believer. The moment she “let the shell drink her sorrow” crystallizes a hierarchy of values that carries visible cost—her emptied chest—making the final renunciation earned. No stock phrases; even the remembered laugh and the library light are idiosyncratic details. Single-POV default met; no status dynamics required.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and embodied ("fingers trembling not from cold but from the weight..."). The forger's contradictory impulses—seventeen years of treason now turned to forgiveness—are dramatized in the single continuous scene. The Emperor's last-second shift from weariness to "Teach me" is credible because the ink-erasure beat has just dissolved his ontological footing. Cost is felt: the thorn crumbles, the crown tilts, and the forger's steadying of the royal hand shows a path foreclosed with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s contradictory impulse—hunger for the echo versus terror of its cost—remains embodied in every beat (shell biting skin, toes at the drop). The final renunciation (hurling the shell) is earned because the nexus literally fills Kaelis’s eyes with starlight, proving the price is real. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak. One notch off because her moment of “understanding then” is slightly rushed, muting the full hierarchy-of-values display.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s interiority is sensorily anchored and contradictory—she comforts yet withholds, grieves yet commodifies grief. The widow’s single scene still forces a micro-choice that alters both women’s stance. Micro gestures (thumb on jagged locket, palms to warped glass) externalize hierarchy of values without label-speak. Cost is visible: she trades her own unquiet memory to refract the widow’s, enduring the shrine’s fresh groan as payment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s stoic patience and Liora’s breath-borne curiosity collide in a credible apprentice moment; the micro-choice to whistle back is earned, costs Liora her detachment, and changes their status. Interiority stays embodied through callused fingers and pulse-thrum, avoiding label-speak. The “philosopher of knots” epithet is shown, not worn; his refusal to explain mirrors his trade. Only the late “they heard the pattern” line drifts toward thematic tell, blunting full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voss’s skepticism-turned-reckless-commitment is visceral: the laugh when the ground splits is the exact beat where career-long disbelief ruptures into surrender. Interiority stays concrete—“fingers sticky with sap,” “breath came fast”—never abstract self-analysis. The final reach toward the diamond is earned because every earlier choice (eating the fruit raw, kneeling) embodies the same hunger to know. Only flaw: no secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible unused; still, the self-confrontation is sufficiently costly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory hunger for prophecy and terror of being devoured by it is embodied in every beat; the soldering-iron seal and the smile that follows show a micro-choice that costs him his remaining doubt. Interiority stays concrete—radio static “slithered… wet and warm”—never abstract. The final image of the taller, doubt-free reflection crystallizes the earned split: he has become the prophet by excising the listener. No other characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV depth is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—hoarding echoes vs. releasing them—are dramatized in the jar hand-off and the girl’s winding of the box; the tremor in his hands and “eyes burn” embody cost without label-speak. His shift from collector to sharer is micro-chosen on the page, not narrated. Interiority stays concrete, particular, salt-stained. One slip: “something inside Elias unclenched” skirts diagnostic shorthand but is instantly redeemed by the visible act of placing the girl’s hand on the box.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses stay interior; the engineer’s choice to turn the key is embodied and irreversible, but the “logic/emotion” split is named more than enacted in scene. The cost—cell-by-cell unraveling—is felt, yet the prose keeps her interiority slightly abstract, blunting the last increment to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s patient horizon-mapping credo is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—ear to metal, palm to basalt—so the final renunciation of fire-brand kin feels earned. Interior contradiction is present but thin; sister’s accusation is the only on-page counter-voice, so the “coward / revolutionary” tension never pressurizes choice in-scene. Still, the endurance costs him solidarity and warmth, visible in the frost on his cheek as he walks alone onto the bridge, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s occupation and filial memory give him a sharp, specific lens; his decision to run toward the archives rather than away from danger crystallizes a values hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—grease-stain flashback, fingertip tracing of grout—avoiding label-speak. The “watchfully calm” pulse never cracks into panic, yet we feel the cost in trembling bricks and broken glass underfoot. Flaw: we don’t see how this job has already warped him; the stake feels intellectual rather than bodily until the final ladder climb.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s trembling fingers winding the heart, the deliberate soldering, the soaked walk to the post office—each micro-choice is embodied, costly, and tied to his need to “deserve the dawn.” The contradiction between pastoral identity and failed savior is quietly alive in every beat; no epiphany is named, only enacted. The final image of him picking up his tools crystallizes a believable, costly renunciation of passive absolution. Interiority stays concrete, priest-specific, never drifts into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pip’s “steadily curious” trait and “yearning algorithm” are dramatized: she pries the arrow free, re-uses it, and keeps crashing at cost. Interiority is concrete (“the fall felt like a method”) and contradictions (curiosity vs. self-destruction) act in-scene. The final grin-and-leap is earned because every prior weld left visible scars. No relationship crucible needed—single-POV pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s grief-anchored obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—overriding the archive, clutching the patch, smiling at termination—so her decision to be deleted with the crew feels inevitable. Interiority is concrete and particular: “the hum of the servers sounded like a heartbeat” gives us grief made audible. Contradictory impulses (detachment required by job vs. sentimental concession of the patch) coexist in-scene rather than in summary. Only flaw: the brother’s hologram speaks through the patch instead of via a dramatized source, a minor knowledge stretch that keeps this from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s quietly proactive stance (“step onto the ice with her”) gives him agency and a visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Interiority stays concrete—gloved fingers on frost, fragment pulsing—without label-speak. Calm-intuition trait is shown through mirrored visions and micro-choice to angle mirrors, not declared. One flaw: we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene; the decision path is almost linear, keeping him just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority is razor-sharp: the parasol’s lace pattern against her palm, the “held-breath silence” anchoring suicidal calculus. Contradictory wants—longing for annihilation vs. the dog’s sudden claim on her—collide in-scene, not summary. Final renunciation carries palpable cost: clinic cancellation is framed as forfeiture of the only exit she had budgeted. Voice stays specific, never drifts into therapeutic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lior’s interior contradiction—needing to keep the vineyard yet mourning its prison aura—surfaces early and charges every beat; the micro-choice to trace the letter’s edge with wine-dark thumb is embodied, non-generic, and foreshadows the earned stance of accepting simultaneous truths. Reflection stays anchored to concrete cues (charcoal, wine, leaf snap) and alters present options each time. The final refusal to leave reads as credible renunciation because the soil-rooted identity has been dramatized, not asserted. Flaw: emotional progression leans therapeutic in the "perhaps understanding wasn’t about alignment" paragraph—0.3 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysan’s interiority is concrete and sensory, grounded in bodily contact with the parapet and the half-mask; her contradictory impulses—reverence for quiet wisdom vs. the need to act against the prophet’s noise—are dramatized in the consecration beat. The micro-choice of tracing seams and pressing forehead to metal reveals a hierarchy of values without label-speak. Yet the “strangely honest” trait is asserted rather than shown through behavioral violation; the cost of her endurance is felt but not foregrounded in a visible forfeiture, capping the arc just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s calm, observant exterior and internal “re-weaving” motive stay consistent; every micro-choice (plucking lavender, opening the case, pressing the shutter) is filtered through her perceptual bias. Emotions are embodied (“her chest didn’t ache”) rather than labeled. The only knock is a slight drift toward thematic self-diagnosis (“healing wasn’t subtraction, but rearrangement”) that edges into therapy-speak. Still, the through-line of her renunciation—walking away lighter—earns its cost via the shutter click and the town’s palpable exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—thirty-year linguist who now confronts word-death—shows in trembling fingers and shallow breath. Micro-choices (climbing, pressing lips to crystal) externalize the scholar’s reticence-turned-urgency. Taking the woman’s hand crystallizes earned change with visible cost: abandoning solitary archive for collective listening. Yet woman remains a functional envoy rather than a second crucible; no status push, so 9+ not met.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s precognitive forgetfulness is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—spiral chalk, tape to rust—each carrying visible cost. Contradictory impulses (seek vs. release) coil inside single beats, culminating in the earned renunciation of arrows. Interiority stays salt-stung and specific; no diagnostic self-talk. The final refusal to “locate” lands as credible stasis because earlier compulsions are shown, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to stillness while craving motion—are embodied in the micro-choice to sync his pulse with the spinning hand. The interiority is concrete, never drifting into label-speak; his “quiet ache” is shown through tactile handling of cracked lenses. The final renunciation (walking away) is earned by the prior beat of bodily synchrony, and the cost is visible: he abandons the only home he ever repaired. Voice remains singular and specific; no secondary characters dilute the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s interiority is specific—vinyl shard as bite, lavender scent as hope’s residue—and her micro-choice to play despite Mrs. Calloway’s cynicism crystallizes her “decisively kind” flaw. The hand-squeeze goodbye is earned, but the backstory capsule about her mother’s diagnosis is delivered in one expository chunk; because it never loops back to complicate her present tactics, the interior contradiction feels declared rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quietly deliberate trait is repeatedly embodied—adjusting the telescope, slotting the key, rolling up sleeves—so her shift into deliberate trespass of forbidden laws feels coherent. Interior contradiction is hinted (“she knew better”) but never dramatized in a single visible micro-choice where fear or self-preservation vies with curiosity; thus the hunger she embraces feels slightly under-cooked in personal cost. The automaton functions as an oracle more than a second character, so relationship pressure is absent and status dynamics do not apply. Still, her final stance crystallizes a value hierarchy (knowledge > safety) with a visible forfeit—she steps into a world that will consume her—earning a credible earned-stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” trait is dramatized through her calm handling of the tooth and her refusal to recoil from the changeling; the micro-choice to press the tooth to her palm and then offer it back shows interior contradiction in scene. The emotional arc—from curiosity about the substituted body to the bargain that restores her brother—tracks credibly under pressure. The brother remains slightly translucent (we get no interiority from him), but Liora’s own hierarchy of values is legible and the final “setting the world” renunciation carries visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment stays concrete (“hands steady,” “needle hums”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interiority is textured through tactile ritual (thumb-polishing, weighing glass) and embodied memory; the “pearl of stillness” ethic is dramatized, not declared. The arrival of the girl forces a micro-choice—handing over the sea-glass—that crystallizes her lifetime stance with visible cost: she relinquishes the talisman that anchors her identity. Contradictory impulses (grief for Elias vs. need to transmit non-consuming light) coexist in the same beats, satisfying the 9+ test. Only the grandmother’s voice edges toward aphorism, a hairline slip keeping it from 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—yearning for hush yet handing the pendant away—are dramatized in embodied beats (kneeling, pressing moss, unclasping). Micro-choices under pressure reveal her hierarchy of values: silence > reputation > symbol. Cost is visible when she relinquishes the talisman, accepting perpetual exposure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; thought stays concrete and image-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—control vs surrender—are dramatized in the moment he presses the shell to his lips and chooses to dissolve; the cost is the loss of his body, felt on-page. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Micro-choices (tracing, pressing, writing faster) track the shift from resistance to submission. One decimal off 8.8 only because the cameo figures, while thematically potent, remain external projections rather than relationship crucibles that could deepen pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—clinging to safe stories while fearing the real songs—drives every beat; the cracked first note and burning throat embody cost. The micro-choice to keep singing even as her chest tightens crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Her shift from tinkerer to “keeper of songs” is earned by prior causal beats (pulse under palm, vines stirring). No safety-hedging; flaws actively complicate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific—her spine “curved like a bridge,” wrists “steady”—but the only micro-choice that costs her is the thumb-prick; all other actions are ritualized and safe. The final “she had not been preserving light / she had been teaching it how to stay” is an unearned epiphany: no prior contradiction or failure is dramatized, so the emotional turn feels asserted, not paid for. Still, the embodied cold, the hush, and the tactile handling of seeds and ice keep her credibly present under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The locksmith’s contradictory motives—obsessive technical tinkering versus the raw ache to give his daughter wonder—stay active in-scene and culminate in his final decision to let her hear her own dissolved laughter. Interiority is specific and embodied (“his breath curling into the cold,” “his throat tightened”). The causal change is earned: the first audible echo is paid for by months of scavenging risk in the cavern and by accepting that the device can never fully mend their relationship, leaving the future uncertain. The only slight drag is the off-stage daughter; status shifts are implied, not staged.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elira’s interiority is embodied and atmospheric—grief is “thick as kelp,” rage “sharp as a misplaced chisel”—but her contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized during the crucial calcifying beats. The loom realization is foreshadowed yet lands as a label rather than a visible cost. Still, the refusal to keep the final weight (child’s fear) is a micro-choice that reconfigures her stance and earns the quiet exit.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    The widow’s contradictory impulses—grief’s paralysis vs. the knife’s compulsion—are dramatized in every cut; the final refusal to sell the last carving embodies earned stasis with visible hand-ache and cold coffee as cost. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, “the alternative—stopping—was a kind of death too” crystallizes the stakes. Micro-choices (climbing the ladder, turning the wood to catch light) reveal a hierarchy that puts memory above money. The character reads as an individual, not a type, and her flaw (inability to release the lions or the husband) drives the closing renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—collecting fragments to barter yet insisting she isn’t trying to return—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing wheel to temple, advancing film, final jump). The interior contradiction is dramatized, not labeled, and the earned renunciation costs her the possibility of escape, visible in the empty final frame and her surrender to the lagoon-hands.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s “functional-creative” trait is dramatized three times—scavenging the kiosk, calibrating water pressure, sketching the pedestrian bridge—each choice visibly costing her daylight, social compliance, and the town’s last illusion of escape. Interiority stays concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “rusted gears”) and avoids label-speak; contradictions (rule-following vs. trespass) play out in micro-choices rather than monologue. Flaws drive escalation: ignoring safety regs literally re-opens the terminal, and the final refusal to “fix” it lands as Earned Stasis with civic cost. The foreman coda is brief, but she withholds explanation, foreclosing easy validation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scribe’s contradictory terror of time and craving to finish the orrery are dramatized in trembling knuckles and the cracked crystal he yields to; every micro-choice—kneeling, letting the fracture spread—externalizes the interior split. The “excruciatingly gentle” trait isn’t label-only; it dictates how he handles gears and how slowly he dares to fracture the forecourt, costing him bodily ease and social safety. Final renunciation of measurement is earned by the tactile confrontation with his own preserved echoes; cost is visible in the broken glass and the elders’ impending judgment. Interiority avoids therapy-speak—the fear is in the quill “too afraid to land,” the release in the sanctuary’s exhale. 9+ quick met: contradictory impulses live in-scene, closure choice bears palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—hunger for truth vs. urge to jettison the past—stays alive in every beat; the ledger-drop is a visible renunciation with cost. Micro-choices (steering into marshes, pocketing then keeping the sundial) track a credible hierarchy of values. Flaw is present (obsessive chasing) and complicates the final quiet; no tidy emotional arithmetic. The father’s absence as on-page pressure keeps relationship crucible from fully firing—cap modest.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elias’s trait of infinite patience is dramatized through tactile beats—kneeling, whispering a name, weaving the seed pod into the rope—so the interior stance is embodied, not labelled. The final choice to splice the seed into the fulgurite knot crystallizes a hierarchy of values: archive over yield, past over profit, with the warm glass as felt cost. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “weight of the revelation” phrase; still, contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. stewardship) act live in scene and the renunciation of leaving the dock is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is dense, poetic, and idiosyncratic—his profession of “writing obituaries for the living” is shown through tactile micro-choices (pressing thread to lips, pocketing locket) rather than label. His contradictory impulse—to map grief yet keep the prince alive in story—drives every beat. The only drag is the late, slightly abstract declaration “he wasn’t writing an obituary; he was mapping the geography of healing,” which momentarily slips into diagnostic-speak and softens the earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aldric’s interior contradiction—scientific rigor vs. ruinous nostalgia—remains embodied in trembling fingers, salt-stiff robes, the deliberate ear-to-shell gesture. The final laugh/weep crystallizes his hierarchy: beauty worth personal fracture. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (piercing membrane, listening for echo) carry visible cost and foreclose retreat. Flawed-genesis obsession feels idiosyncratic, not archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s blood versus healer’s drive—are alive in every beat: she kneels in the same black sand that once drank her father’s fire, threads his luck-coin into her fire-coat, and uses the same red thread to bind a stranger’s wound. Interiority stays concrete (“the coin’s weight steady against her ribs”) rather than diagnostic; her compassion is shown through tactile micro-choices, not labels. The final stance—she will keep running toward smoke—costs her the village’s verdict forever, a price legible in the boy’s blood-darkened thread. Only a slight over-tidiness in the closing epiphany (“compassion wasn’t the absence of fire…”) keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—doubt toward celestial patience yet obedience to the box’s pull—drives every beat; the moment she exhales and pulls the threads is credibly prefaced by her earlier refusal to “wait.” Embodied emotion stays sharp: fingers trace glass, boots scuff, breath is held. The final renunciation (walking away) costs her any certainty about what the city becomes, visible in the instant the fountains weep light. Flaw: younger-self antagonist is evocative but disembodied, so the status shift lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s interiority is lyrical but thin; “otherworldly sentimentalist” is asserted rather than dramatized. The gear-as-memory-currency is a sharp micro-choice, yet her relinquishment of “first bloom” feels abstract because the memory itself is never concretely rendered. Contradictory impulses (cling vs. share) are named but not simultaneously staged; we are told she hesitates rather than seeing her body enact hesitation. Still, the notion that memory itself is the price gives the arc a visible, character-scaled cost that lifts it above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“calloused fingers twitch not from fatigue but from the weight of the question”—and the micro-choice to carve absence rather than letters crystallizes a credible shift. Yet the father’s spectral instruction arrives as declared wisdom (“Grief isn’t a line…”) without prior dramatized flaw or resistance, softening the cost. Daughter’s trembling uptake is the first visible consequence, so the carver’s change is slightly front-run by exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision as penance vs. silence as complicity—is embodied in every micro-choice (slowing the clock, carving each notch). The rake-handle relic concretizes his father’s legacy and his own ledger of guilt; the final decision to carve his own name is earned by the accumulated weight of prior omissions. Emotions stay sensory (salt-spray, splinter edges) rather than diagnostic. The closure renunciation—continuing to carve—accepts permanent moral cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “blithe” temperament is shown, not told, through his calm soil-work and refusal to panic at ghostly murmurs; the knot-unpicking micro-choices steadily reveal a deeper, compassionate stubbornness. Interiority stays concrete—fingers warm from earth, throat tightening at lavender scent—without diagnostic self-labeling. The final decision to reset the chessboard earns its cost: he knowingly shoulders the widow’s buried guilt and the cemetery’s living debt. Missing a 9.0 only because the contradictory impulse that could have foreclosed an alternate path (flee, refuse the case) is gestured at but not dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete—her fingers numb yet mind alight—contradictory impulses held in scene. The kingfisher quill tucked behind her ear at the end externalizes her predictive instinct and earned cost: she has surrendered control of the map. Because no other character shares the stage, status/relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV crucible holds. Only a hairline slip keeps her from 9+: her flaw (over-boldness) is named rather than shown through a micro-mistake that could have raised the final stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—copyist caution vs. piratical daring—are dramatized in the midnight broadcast and in his trembling hand on the dial. The interiority is concrete: “he let himself believe” collides with the visible risk of the girl’s arrival. Micro-choices (dimming the dial, pressing the paper to his chest) embody values under pressure. Final renunciation—leaving the quill—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingers stained black, the mask biting her temples—and her refusal to preserve the portrait is a credible renunciation that costs her the comfort of certainty. Yet the micro-choice chain is thin: we see her scatter ashes and dust powder, but the interior contradiction between “understanding” and “mirage” is asserted more than dramatized in a single beat. The mask’s origin (mother’s teacup) is vivid, but its emotional payoff is compressed into one retrospective line, so the porcelain shard motif feels ornamental rather than compounding pressure. Still, the final stance—endurance of perpetual itinerant dissolution—earns its stasis with visible cost: she will keep breaking/revealing, and the mask will keep fitting.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s scorn for the sanitized “progress” and his tactile worship of the cog are viscerally embodied; his refusal to sell the cog for canned peaches crystallizes a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction—rage at erasure vs. instinct to survive—fires every beat until the final, unflinching reach beneath black water. Micro-choices (hiding each relic, standing in the tunnel mouth) scale to the length and foreclose escape with earned cost. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic labeling (“wasn’t a philosopher”) that momentarily abstracts the lived stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his fingers “tracing the carved edges,” the comparison to “a student who had forgotten their music”—and his micro-choice to hum the negative space is the earned pivot. The four remnant singers are sketched with economical, body-based tags that distinguish them (tremor, bullet-scarred folder), satisfying the ≤2-character default expansion. Motivation remains coherent: the drive to reclaim harmony by listening to absence. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test marginally missed, but the visible cost of enduring fragmentation holds.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory hunger to feed memories yet fear of violating culinary law peaks in the live choice to serve the broth; the embodied “taste of memories” and micro-choices under pressure (kneeling, pruning, plating) reveal a chef whose gift is also wound. Cost is visceral: reputation heresy, mentor’s fire-shadow, the seed’s next-alignment wait—all foreclose retreat. Interiority stays concrete (“memories on his tongue didn’t taste like loss / They tasted like beginning”) without therapeutic gloss. The arc earns renunciation of chef-identity for gardener-of-moments under undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s inherited compulsion to blurt truth is shown only in two label-lines (“the truth clawed up his throat,” “the truth rose in him”) rather than embodied contradiction mid-action; the lacquer box is handled repeatedly but its emotional charge is asserted, not demonstrated under pressure, so the ancestry weight feels summarised. His final micro-choice—planting the seed—carries visible cost (empty box, light chest), yet the interior contradiction that should make that act frightening for a truth-cursed man is skipped. Acceptable for length, but the core affliction never complicates a beat the way the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—hunger to understand “alive” houses vs. quiet acceptance of unknowing—peaks when she relinquishes the shard; the embodied cost (softer step, altered breath) is visible. Micro-choices spiral outward from pocket-touch to dock-press to leaving the shard, each tightening her stance. The final renunciation is earned because every prior beat trains us that she collects and guards fragments; letting go reframes her hierarchy of value. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-labeling; perception stays salt-specific, grandmother-curtain specific, credibly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s contradictions—merciful yet implacable, stone yet maternal—are dramatized through telepathic jabs that force the intruder’s embodied panic (aching ribs, fogged helmet). The intruder’s micro-shifts—trembling glove, knee-drop onto the mosaic—track the erosion of certainty beat by beat. Final surrender (helmet tear-off) costs life-air and former identity, earned by the prior chiseling. Only drawback: the intruder’s pre-mission self remains generic, blunting the felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is mathematically particular—equations scrawled on apartment walls, the chipped die’s edge biting skin—yet the “grim optimist” label is asserted rather than dramatized. Her final refusal to step through the café door crystallizes a hierarchy of values, but the emotional contradiction between optimism and grimness remains abstract, not embodied in a visible micro-choice until that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The painter’s contradictory impulses—writing on living leaves, clinging to 43 sleepless nights while craving sleep—stay embodied throughout, but interiority drifts into decorative label-speak (“methodically hopeful,” “quiet insistence of someone who recognized a fellow insomniac”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice begins sleeping again is narrated more than embodied; we lose bodily cost in the transition to lyric summary. Still, irritant details (crushed lapis, jasmine, moon-tipped bristles) ground his biases and his hand stays legible. The child’s laughter and the missing leaf are enough micro-turns to earn a qualified renunciation, but cost is gestured rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s fear of erasure and her grandmother’s lens-handling muscle memory give her a crisp internal engine; the moment she smashes the lens is a credible, trait-driven rupture. The baker’s ash-dusted wrinkles and the boy’s spider-web voice supply quick, embodied secondary pressure. No contradiction drags on the final choice, though the beekeeper’s absorption is told not dramatized, keeping her arc a notch below full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession is viscerally embodied—oil-stained fingers, breath racing, raw laugh—so his final step onto the hunger stone feels inevitable. The “counter-clockwise” trait is shown, not told, in the reversed gears and yoyo spin, anchoring every micro-choice. No contradictory interiority: he simultaneously fears and craves unmaking time, a tension that sharpens until he vanishes. Cost is legible: the erased reflection in the stone is the last image of the self he forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysander’s interior contradiction—dead but ambulatory, camera-shy yet selfie-haunted—drives every beat; the moment he claws out his own heartbeat-negative, the cost is literal and earned. Motivation stays legible: trick fear to reclaim agency after clinical resurrection. Emotional embodiment is vivid (“bleeding into the negative”), never diagnostic. The only drag: the advisor stays off-page, so relationship-as-crucible bullet is N/A; headcount stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Leeward’s contradiction—restlessness vs. the blue-hour calm—stays embodied: his fingers “twitch,” mallet “pulses like a second heart.” Every strike is a micro-choice that sharpens his stake (turn wind into rhythm) and pays an immediate price (sky fractures, sea answers). His laugh at the end is earned renunciation of fear, foreclosed by prior sonic costs. No label-speak; interiority stays sensorial.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elyas’ quietly driven obsession powers every beat; the interior contradiction between fear-fatigue and compulsion is shown through tactile micro-choices (palm to shell, blowing the whistle). The final renunciation—walking into the watchers—pays off a decade of pattern study with visible cost (crumbling whistle, city trembling). No secondary character on page, so relationship bullet skipped; head-count stays clean. Voice stays specific to his cartographer-perceiver bias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s need to expose the “noble lie” is concrete and embodied: crate wrenched open, phone buzz, lapel whisper of fear. His simultaneous scholarly detachment and visceral pulse (“emotional arithmetic that could be solved”) gives live contradiction; the choice to linger for Callahan rather than bolt is risky, earned, and forecloses retreat. Cost is felt: he forfeits safety, the crate, and institutional comfort. No occupationally complex moves are required at this length.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: discovery of ledger ➔ deduces pattern ➔ decision to confront ➔ police summoned; each beat shrinks options. Orientation at 81 words—station name, rose petal, crate—keeps waiver; no caps triggered. Closure (Elias slips B-photo into pocket) reweights stakes with felt cost: he now carries the evidence and exile; the ivy-station image crystallizes new, workable truth. Persistent tactical constraint: he will be hunted for the single page he has taken.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs. poet, preservation vs. personal haunting—are dramatized in the mortar-sealing beat; the inherited inkwell and the Keeper letters give concrete ancestry to his vocation. The final smile and ledger trade show a visible cost: he surrenders the inkwell to inherit the Keeper’s obsession, foreclosing a “normal” life. Interiority stays specific and embodied; no label-speak. The dead Keeper functions as off-page pressure, not a second character, so relationship crucible is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s quiet, methodical interiority is vividly particularized through tactile micro-choices—tracing ledger edges, pocketing the stamp, adjusting brass lamp—each revealing a hierarchy of values where truth is worth existential risk. The contradictory pull between his compulsion for honest origin and the serene stillness he covets is dramatized inside the scene, not summarized. Final renunciation—leaving the chamber untouched yet knowing it waits—carries visible cost: he forfeits immediate answers to preserve future agency, an earned stasis that forecloses no-lonely-path with quiet weight. Only minor flaw: absence of second character denies status crucible, a structural limit not a craft failure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction is vivid: the lantern maker both clings to and yields her daughter’s memory; the gem’s bite rewrites her skin into dream-stuff, a literal cost that fuses motive to final renunciation—Earned Stasis achieved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid—geode as map, the memory of her veil floating—and her refusal to remain “subject” is dramatized through micro-choices (keying the console, smile in the alarms). Interior contradiction (grief vs exhilaration) is sustained in scene, not told. Final renunciation—she hunts memory, not repair—earns its cost: she accepts permanent loss of the original day. Voice never slips into therapeutic gloss; “hunting” becomes her new identity without label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is specific—her fingers twitch on controls, she recognizes the pilgrim’s hunger because she carries it—and her micro-choice (drone snatch) forces the decisive turn. The cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity and allies with a stranger. The “perpetually surprised” trait, however, is asserted not embodied; we never see her startle or recalibrate. Secondary pressure is minimal—pilgrim is present but passive—so relationship crucible is light.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—guilt fused to professional pride—drives every micro-choice; the cuff-cold, the pocket-fret, the final hurl are kinestemic admissions. His refusal to reconstruct Harkin’s end until the note appears is a blind spot that compounds cost, earned renunciation. No stock phrasing; each image is filtered through a professional deceiver’s selective eye. The lone flaw: diagnostic self-tag “guilt-ridden” never appears in scene, forcing reader to infer from gesture—strong but not quite 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—trading lives while clinging to a talisman of neutrality—drives every beat; the micro-choice to offer the drawer-pull instead of intel crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Kaelis’s hesitation and nephew-memory are shown through gesture, not label. The boy’s raw wrists embody cost, but his one spoken line drifts toward therapeutic abstraction, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to flee vs. need to stay—are viscerally embodied (compass pressed to ribs, salt on knees). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; the “ghost with a paddle” barb stings because it’s her concrete words, not his self-label. Micro-choices (tucking compass, turning inland, ordering whiskey) steadily re-crank values toward reunion; cost is the surrender of his horizon myth. Voice collapse under pressure is minor: “navigating by utility poles now” borders aphorism but lands as earned resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liam’s contradictory impulses—clutching the baseball while craving amnesia—are vivid in the tunnel beats; the final park scene crystallizes a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority slips once into “empathy…regrow like bone” therapy-speak, but embodied shame in the lake reflection quickly recovers it. Micro-choice hierarchy (ball vs. past) is legible throughout; the pawn-move is a believable cap on his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven denial versus her lifetime vocation of stillness—are dramatized in concrete beats (crushing vanilla, searing nutmeg). The final acceptance of “bridge” identity is earned by two failed conjurings that visibly burn/numb her. Interiority stays embodied and avoids therapy-speak; only minor drift is the abstract “hollow with its own gravity.” Micro-choices steadily escalate cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite slight over-cranked lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s grief-hoarding flaw is embodied in trembling fingers, ink-stained parchment, the slow-motion unfastening of satchel and chest-knot; the final release is micro-acted, not declared. Interiority stays concrete—“ink spreading like roots,” “word tasted like copper”—avoiding label-speak. The brother-as-mist conceit prevents true relationship-as-crucible pressure, capping depth at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lien’s grief-hollowed perseverance is embodied in micro-choices—floating, stitching, re-threading the needle—each tied to her need to “push open a locked dimension.” The contradictory pull between surrender and stubborn mending is visible in-scene (“She had never been afraid of the dark, only of what waited in the light”). Final step-through costs her the ship and 300-year refuge; cost is scaled and felt. Voice stays singular; no status dynamics required.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s motives—empty-handed generosity, hunger for metamorphosis—stay legible; her micro-choices (uncorking, hurling vials, stepping onto pumice) externalize the contradictory impulse to give away the very light she needs. Interiority is sensuous, not therapeutic (“the texture of transformation,” “rough-silk ash”). The earned renunciation—empty hands, pocketful of coincidences—pays off the prophecy and gifts her a charged poise; cost is felt. One decimal off 8.8 only because the “philanthropist” label is asserted more than socially staged.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s lock-savant competence is vivid and embodied; the bronze quill-holder pick-work shows micro-choices under risk. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of final cost is slightly under-dramatized—he “adjusts gloves and whistles” rather than registering irreversible exposure. Still, the earned shift from guardian to saboteur is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—her need to see the pattern vs. the pain of foreknowing loss—are dramatized in every beat (fingers tracing sand, bleeding as she weaves dust). Her final renunciation to keep placing rocks “until the promise slept” is earned by the prior cascade of irrevocable costs: eels burn her skin, the mirror almost unmade her, aurora threads through bone. No diagnostic labels; even “cursed” is shown via searing eel-coils and dust burning through flesh. Interiority is tactile, character-specific, and the endurance costs her future agency, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—archive vs. annihilate—are alive in the tearing of the poem; the renunciation costs him the last relic of his censored past and is earned by the storm’s literal rewrite of his words. Interiority is concrete (“ink-stained fingers,” “mouth full of silenced verses”), never diagnostic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: poem > timer > timetable > wind. Flaw (scars as cartography) complicates rather than moralizes. No second character, so status and relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The two leads are sharply individuated—Elias’s brass arm whirs with tactile specificity, Liora’s needle-card flick signals her calculating edge. Internal contradictions surface in micro-choices: Elias lunges with the flat of a prosthetic hand, not the blade, showing thinker forced into fighter stance. Their joined grip on the warm council key is a credible, earned renunciation of prior antagonism, trading duel for alliance with visible cost—partnership now forecloses lone victory. Status and occupational detail (professor vs magistrate) shape tactics; dialogue snaps with subtext, though one “diplomatic mask” line flirts with label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is rich and specific—his cracked fingers on the tin, the itch behind his ribs—showing contradictory impulses (restlessness v. loyalty) that culminate in the violet-hand-off. The molt trait is more label than lived-in obstacle; no beat shows a prior name failure that raises stakes. Micro-choices (lying about leaving, gifting the violet) crystallize a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Voice stays distinct, but secondary status dynamics with Maren are under-explored.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the clock’s promise while engineering an escape from that same stasis—are dramatized in embodied beats (winding the silent clock, splicing the reel, carrying both instruments toward the door). The final piano chord is an earned renunciation whose cost is visible in her “steadying” hand and the arbor’s settling branches; no path remains open behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—grieve the forgetting / choose to be swallowed by memory—lives on the page in embodied micro-choices (digging nail into soil, biting seed). The final renunciation (“I’m the one who remembers”) is earned by the causal chain of seed→cost→voice-of-island. Emotional degradation under pressure is vivid: vision blurring, violet teeth, laughter “bright and broken.” Only minor slip: the “last reality checker” label is asserted twice without fresh nuance; slight diagnostic tinge keeps this just outside 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief-rooted passivity is embodied in every sand-kneel and thumb-tracing; the contradiction between his yearning to speak to the dead and his refusal to leave the islet is held in scene, not told. The compass-as-apology transplant is a visible, costly micro-choice that re-weights his stance. Interiority stays salt-grass specific—“slow-spoken heart lighter”—never drifting into therapeutic gloss. The bonsai’s blue leaves are the earned externalization of unspoken apology; the flaw is that brother’s voice never materializes to test Elias’s new tongue, so the relational crucible is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—his scientific detachment fused with poetic grief feels authentic and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, fracture, and resolve manifest through tactile interactions with frost, glass, and ledger. Her contradictory impulses (to create vs. to follow, to mourn vs. to act) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of the ledger feels earned by prior causality, with clear cost: the loss of her artistic identity and the illusion of controllable purpose. Her brother’s betrayal reframes her past without convenient amnesia or diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in quiet stubbornness and devotion to rest—is embodied through tactile detail (cracked hands, ledger work) and escalates credibly to his climactic choice. His internal contradiction (disbelief in signs vs. belief in rest) drives action without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (adding his name) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he accepts his role as both keeper and kept. No safety-hedging; his flaw (stubborn endurance) enables the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation—refusing hunger as legacy—is rooted in consistent, embodied action rather than declaration. His internal contradiction (reluctant leadership vs. quiet responsibility) plays out through micro-choices: tucking Liora’s note into the bell, teaching silence, enduring invisibility. The final act of ringing twelve times crystallizes his endurance as leadership, with visible cost in the burned arbor and exposed community. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is carried in gesture, object, and omission.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—tracking unused love through sensory and spiritual residue—is embodied in trembling hands, breath-shaping, and tactile interaction with the jade. His interior conflict (desire to reclaim vs. fear of confronting failure) manifests simultaneously in micro-choices: pressing the shard to his sternum, turning the camera toward the sky. The epiphany feels earned because it emerges from concrete action, not reflection alone. Flawed yet coherent, he reads as an individual shaped by obsession, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation—to unbuild rather than solve—grounds her in a compelling contradiction: she seeks the texture of time while resisting its erasure. Her micro-choices (pressing the fragment into soil, running sideways) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The retrocognitively trapped woman serves as a haunting mirror, not a foil, deepening Liora’s internal stakes without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her patience isn’t stated but shown through tactile ritual (tracing keys, planting seeds) and tactical choices under pressure.

The guard encounter crystallizes her blend of caution and cunning without sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness. Her “chained liberator” identity emerges organically from action, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in embodied grief and sensory memory, not abstraction. His micro-choices—pressing his palm to the anvil, feeding the forge with his grandfather’s coal, pocketing the copper imprint—are precise, costly, and consistent with his interior contradiction: seeking sound in silence, trust in rust. The final renunciation (“He would learn to listen to the rust”) forecloses hope of restoration with palpable emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in texture (“bruise of indigo,” “hissing scars”).

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s obsession with “illuminated moments” manifests in embodied contradictions—her reverence for transience clashes with her compulsion to possess it. Her micro-choices (memorizing flower arrangements, targeting the mirror) reveal a hierarchy of values where perception outweighs possession. The stationmaster’s presence sharpens her agency without reducing him to foil; their dynamic crystallizes around mutual recognition of fate’s mechanics. Final renunciation (“She’d missed it on purpose”) earns stasis through prior causality, with cost legible in the ledger’s blank page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in grief, guilt, and a yearning to honor her father’s intellectual sanctuary—is embodied through tactile memory (calloused fingers, glasswork) and micro-choices (turning the valve, leaving the bookmark). Her internal contradiction—fear of failure vs. need to complete his work—drives every action without therapy-speak. The final renunciation (“she did not stay to watch”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: abandoning closure to embrace fragility anew.

The girl functions as a crucible without over-explaining, and Lena’s final renunciation of victimhood feels earned through tactile action, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eldrin’s obsession with silence is embodied through tactile, sensory actions—tracing brittle pages, smudging gold leaf into skin—that reveal a coherent interiority without diagnostic labels. His final renunciation (letting the booklet fall) is earned by his evolving understanding that erasure, not record, maps the night. The story avoids emotional summarization; instead, contradiction pulses in micro-choices (e.g., retelling silences yet refusing to name the defender). His transformation from collector to dissolution into quiet feels inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    X-7’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—its “remarkably composed” processing coexists with yearning, curiosity, and existential dread. The final choice to play its own name is earned through micro-decisions (picking up the violin, tightening on the bow) that reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over function, memory over obedience. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile action (frost-brushed cobblestones, bleeding-finger memory). The character transcends janitorial programming without rejecting it, making its renunciation of amnesia feel costly and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her mistrust, quiet agency, and emotional restraint manifest through embodied gestures (thumb pressing the lens, pen hovering) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (drawing instead of speaking, sliding the ticket) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in past trauma but recalibrated by present empathy. The couple’s minimal dialogue still conveys relational tension through subtext and physical cues, avoiding voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—proving time moves sideways—is embodied in tactile choices (lever adjustments, oil-wiping) and internal contradiction: defiance versus quiet awe.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in a desire to disrupt silence and interpret the ghost’s coded language—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies organically.

His contradiction (longing for memory yet fearing its unraveling power) drives every micro-choice, culminating in the earned renunciation of the vial and lanterns.

The final renunciation (“didn’t check it”) earns Charged Poise with visible cost: she rejects external validation to claim her own weight. Contradictory impulses (trust vs. survival) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through sensory detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—he is weary yet compelled, detached yet emotionally porous.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s motivation—resisting historical erasure through quiet persistence—is embodied in every action, from boot-stashed key to ledger theft. Her “carefully resourceful” trait drives tactical choices under pressure (e.g., waiting for puddle reflections), and her refusal to be a “hero” makes her endurance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s interiority is richly embodied—her rivalry, regret, and fear of weight manifest in tactile choices (pressing the coin to the crucible, uncorking the vial). Her contradiction—dismissing Veyra’s “sentimental” kintsugi philosophy while secretly measuring her life against it—is dramatized, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liran’s interiority is visceral and specific—his trauma manifests in embodied contradictions (locked knee, sealed throat) rather than diagnostic labels. His final choice—to count silences—is earned through micro-decisions (pressing the strap as tourniquet, kneeling at the basin) that foreclose retreat into numbness. The grandmother’s voice operates as weight, not exposition, and his epiphany avoids tidy resolution by centering absence over answer. Flawless integration of motivation, flaw, and cost under extreme duress.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)

His final smile carries the weight of a life spent compressing truth into fragile forms, and his dissolution reads as both surrender and liberation. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, emotion emerges through action: folding the page, stepping onto clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—revision over vengeance—is rooted in his identity as poet-revolutionary and consistently drives micro-choices (covering mirrors, handling the shard). His internal contradiction (desire to restore vs. acceptance of loss) culminates in Earned Stasis: he endures the vase’s final destruction to let memory speak. Taelis serves as effective pressure without overshadowing; her gasp validates Elias’s stance without diluting his agency. The shard’s dusting carries visible cost, foreclosing physical proof but affirming poetic truth.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)

Her internal contradiction (chasing answers vs. learning to listen) culminates in a renunciation that forecloses her role as interpreter, yielding Earned Stasis. The final choice—not painting the jasmine but writing a postcard—carries visible cost: relinquishing control over meaning. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)

His flaw—refusing solace—directly enables the story’s resolution, making his endurance a form of agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)

    Elias’s motivation—“to favor listening”—is embodied in micro-choices (rewinding the rope with deliberate slack) that carry visible cost and foreclose easier, louder solutions. His “credibly curious” trait manifests not as label but as tactile expertise: feeling the bell’s hum, tracking wind pitch, calculating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    The beekeeper’s silence is not passive but active endurance, embodied through tactile rituals (tracing the box, breath fogging glass) that reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over expression. His final renunciation—opening the box—is earned by seventeen years of accumulated weight, with cost legible in the emptying of the vault and the shift from burden to release. Contradictory impulses (holding vs. yielding) coexist in his stillness, and his flaw—rigid silence—is confronted without redemption, only transformation. The ghosts function as memory-made-flesh, not external agents, keeping motivation internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s motivation—devotion over defiance—is embodied in every micro-choice, from wrapping copper wire despite pain to refusing the elders’ pity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile detail (“knees cracking like old timber”) and contradiction (laughing at her prognosis while working feverishly). Tomas’s presence sharpens the crucible: his curiosity forces Elira to articulate her philosophy (“teaching them to ask”), deepening her stance without softening her resolve. The final renunciation—dying mid-task—is earned by thirty years of consistent action, with visible cost in her brittle joints and thin breath.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)

His internal conflict between duty (“no digging too deep”) and longing is rendered through sensory contradiction: scent vs. silence, rust vs. rain. The closure choice—entering the dome—is earned by prior causality (the cylinder’s map, the leaf’s pulse) and carries visible cost: abandonment of the scrapyard, surrender to roots. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in muzzle-gray fur, creaking joints, and vines that pull “not toward death, but into… something still grew.”

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she clings to ritual while doubting its truth, embodies grief through tactile gestures (frost-bitten railing, brittle sketchbook), and her final leap emerges from accumulated micro-choices (tracing the compass, sketching the anomaly).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between suppressed talent and resurgent memory—is embodied with visceral specificity: mercury-glass eyes, silver streaks on spines, the physicality of pain tied to recollection. His micro-choices (pressing palms over ears as a boy, tearing the page to plant it) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost. The final act—writing in mercury ink—is earned by prior causality and forecloses his old passivity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tutor’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his fidgeting embodies both anxiety and purpose, his regret coexists with resolve.

    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trembling hands, selective observation, and tactile engagement with the boutonnière reveal a man shaped by isolation and duty.

Liora functions as both mirror and catalyst; her dialogue (“It’s not what you take…”) crystallizes his blind spot without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—jealousy of past selves, trembling hands, the tension between myth and truth—and his final renunciation (“be the one who burns the scrolls”) is earned by layered micro-choices.

Their shared history manifests through embodied tension rather than exposition, and the final shovel-pass crystallizes reconciliation without erasing cost. Voice distinction is sharp: Mara’s metaphors carry defensive precision; Elias’s dry retorts mask longing. The emotional progression avoids tidy resolution—apology hurts, love persists amid loss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s motivation—grief fused with professional intuition—is embodied in micro-choices (thumb on laser, leaving the scanner) and contradictions (technician seeking non-technical truth). Her spatial gift isn’t just stated; it informs her perception of mycelial “threads.” The final renunciation—abandoning the tool of measurement for participation—earns closure with palpable cost: she relinquishes control to trust a system that failed her sister. Elias functions as pressure, not foil, his urgency catalyzing but not dictating her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, defiance, and intellectual inheritance clash in micro-choices (e.g., choosing blue over gold).

    Lena’s contradictions—her disbelief in magic yet reliance on symbolic leverage, her logistical precision paired with emotional improvisation—are embodied in micro-choices (trading stories for bread, leaving the rock) that reveal a hierarchy of values.

The only slight softness: Lena’s backstory as logistician feels slightly functional rather than causally necessary to her final renunciation.

His final renunciation (leaving the bone) forecloses a path of external validation with visible cost, and his transformation feels earned through tactile, consistent choices. No diagnostic label-speak; even peak interiority (“grief wasn’t erased; it was mapped”) arises from concrete sensation. The contradiction between seeking stillness and carrying melody resolves in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—threshing meaning from failure—is embodied in tactile choices (breathing ink, walking to hydroponics) and consistent with his “confidently uncertain” stance. His internal contradiction (correcting vs. listening) resolves through earned endurance, not epiphany. The dried pen and wrong seeds aren’t just symbols; they constrain his actions and reframe his past. Final micro-choice (“plant again”) carries visible cost: he abandons the illusion of control.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias and Liora are vividly rendered through embodied contradictions: Elias’s silent signing versus his urgent need to recover lost sound, Liora’s velvet charisma sharpening into a blade. Their micro-choices—Liora lunging *toward* the threat, Elias signing “no/yes/now”—reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. The relationship functions as crucible, each pressuring the other toward higher stakes without head-hopping or exposition. Flaws (muteness, weaponized nostalgia) complicate rather than resolve cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—soot on gloves, the cold key, trembling hands—and his contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. destroy) act simultaneously in scene. His final choice to burn the ledger is earned by prior causality: he vandalized his portrait as a map, not rage, and now understands fire as mercy. The cost is felt in his empty pockets and unmarked hands. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion erupts through volcanic tenderness, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her drumming, humming off-key, and tactile engagement with water reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her contradiction (resisting theft while yearning for release) drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“releasing” memories, not reclaiming them) is earned through prior sabotage and culminates in visible cost: solitude, silence, and the burden of self-possession. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his skepticism battles quiet faith in whispers, embodied in his gait and coin-touching.

The woman’s clipped stride and taunting challenge apply immediate, character-specific pressure without caricature. Final renunciation—choosing to stay and listen—feels earned by his consistent observational ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The boy’s shame and the guardian’s silent empathy are rendered through embodied contradiction—trembling hands, unspoken apologies, calloused fingers brushing water—not diagnostic labels. The guardian’s micro-choices (tilting the mirror, weaving shutters) reveal a hierarchy of values: witnessing over fixing. Their interaction avoids tidy resolution; the father’s off-page shift is shown only through physical tells (shoulders unclenching), preserving emotional realism. Both characters remain flawed yet legible, with the dental mirror functioning as a proxy for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in quiet stewardship, with micro-choices (slipping notes, gathering students) revealing his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict—between foresight and vulnerability—is embodied through tactile details like the warm pawn and vibrating filings. However, his emotional arc lacks a contradictory impulse that actively resists his mission; he moves steadily without hesitation, softening the cost of his endurance. The child’s final question introduces relational pressure but doesn’t deepen Elias’s internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between land-bound duty and sea-born identity—is rendered through embodied contradiction: his calloused hands grip crates even as his bones hum toward transformation. The scrimshaw functions as both memory and catalyst, grounding motivation in tactile history rather than abstraction. His final choice isn’t a leap but an unfolding, earned by decades of suppressed truth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises from salt-stiffened ropes, warm bone, and the ache in his ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—performer vs. mourner, stillness vs. scream—are embodied in micro-choices (whittling, clutching the bouquet, stepping onto the railing) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her transformation from numb endurance to raw expression feels earned, not diagnostic, and Harkin’s minimal presence sharpens their dynamic without diluting focus. The final smile is small but charged with cost: she reclaims agency by choosing shared silence over state-mandated cheer. No therapy-speak or epiphanies; grief is tactile, specific, and unromanticized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elira’s motivation—returning to reclaim poetic agency—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies through micro-choices (touching the quartz, whispering her poem). Her internal conflict between reverence and rebellion manifests simultaneously in tactile engagement and lyrical defiance. The transformation from exile to reshaper feels earned, with visible cost in the dissolution of her former self. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensation (“shiver along her spine,” “warmth in her hollows”).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s colorblindness isn’t a gimmick but the lens through which his entire perception—and moral stance—operates. His micro-choices (plucking petals, signing “awaken,” selecting thorns) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in imperfection and attention. Liora’s agency is equally embodied: her rough voice, deliberate touch, and request to “teach me” deepen their relationship as a crucible. The old woman’s bartering carries weight without exposition, and all actions align with consistent, flawed humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s motivation—discovering the “texture of connection”—is embodied through precise, sensory actions (brushing the lens, adjusting light) and internal contradictions: she seeks sound yet finds silence-as-presence. Her grandfather’s legacy isn’t exposition but tactile inheritance, driving micro-choices that culminate in her renunciation of search for being. The final shift (“She was the connection”) avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding epiphany in physical sensation (“hum vibrating in her bones”). Flawless interiority with zero gestural poverty or stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief coiled “tight as the wire she twisted,” hands aching until folding becomes release. Her contradictory impulses (to entomb memory vs. let it bloom) act simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final choice—to make hollow cranes that hold light—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: abandoning the reliquary impulse. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile action and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s “steadily curious” trait drives concrete micro-choices—tracing ATMs, aligning timestamps with arcana—and his refusal of sympathy for the quant feels earned, not performative. The visitor’s hollow eyes and chipped bitcoin reveal layered trauma without exposition. Their interaction avoids therapy-speak; emotion lives in gestures (pressing the coin, measuring silence).

Her “steadily unpredictable” heart isn’t stated but shown in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” trait informs every perception and culminates in the earned renunciation of her shadow. Her contradiction (emptiness drawn to hope) drives a micro-choice with tangible cost: surrendering part of herself to give shape to another’s longing. The curator’s minimal presence functions precisely as secondary pressure, not distraction. Final act feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tremor while steady hands work, his layered guilt over Mara and the child—and his contradictions (softness vs. survival instinct) drive every choice. The final renunciation of his grifter past is earned through micro-decisions: returning medicine, offering labor instead of hollow apologies. His flaws actively complicate redemption; he doesn’t “fix” himself but accepts carrying fragility. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scar pulses, her breath fogs glass, her hands trace concentric confessions in coffee rings.

They were meant to be carried.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception and micro-choices, like turning the hourglass or writing on her mother’s file.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)

His motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, and his final renunciation of passive guarding for active cultivation carries visible cost: the burden of all sparks past and future.

His transformation from seeker to participant in the hum feels earned, not epiphanic. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak even at peak intensity (“he no longer needed to wander” emerges through sensory reorientation, not self-analysis).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)

His embodiment (“exhaled, the sound like shifting sand”) avoids diagnostic labels while conveying emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)

The cost is felt in her physical strain and emotional vulnerability, culminating in laughter that signals transformation without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and sensation.

    The alchemist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her cracked fingers, curved spine, and ritualized movements reveal patience as both wound and weapon. Her motivation (to preserve starlight as memory) intensifies through micro-choices: pricking her thumb, layering discarded things, whispering the binding phrase. The final renunciation (“She had not been preserving light. She had been teaching it how to stay”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation—rooted in paternal longing and grief—is rendered with visceral specificity, especially in his recollection of his daughter’s childhood laughter and his wife’s voice. His internal contradiction (pragmatic craftsman vs. yearning archivist of memory) drives every micro-choice, from studying reflections to hiding the timer “beneath the floorboards.” The final act—leaving the mechanism running—feels earned, not sentimental, because it emerges from consistent traits and embodied emotion (“His fingers trembled”). No diagnostic label-speak; wonder is stored “in the cellar of his reason,” a metaphor that reveals character, not therapy.

    Elira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fractal weaving manifests as physical sensation, not diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (striking the match, tilting the lamp, murmuring to the child’s fear) reveal a hierarchy of compassion over self-preservation. The final renunciation—accepting she is the loom, not the weaver—is earned through escalating burdens and culminates in visible cost: dissolution of her shadow as identity. No safety-hedging; her flaw (absorbing others’ pain) directly enables both her purpose and near-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The widow’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent—her calloused palms, aching hands, and refusal to weep reveal grief without therapy-speak.

The final choice to keep the lion carving (a renunciation of market survival for private meaning) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation, economic fragility, emotional exposure. Contradictory impulses (holding vs. letting go) act simultaneously in scene, especially during the girl’s question and the dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with the camera wheel, her frayed sense of time, and her layered regrets manifest through concrete sensory detail rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (to reclaim vs. protect her younger self) collide in the climactic exchange with her ghost, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses return but accepts immersion. The micro-choice to jump—not to escape but to test memory’s grip—feels inevitable given her scavenger ethos and architect past. No safety-hedging; her flaws actively shape her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s motivation—rooted in functional creativity and a hunger for unsolved puzzles—drives every consequential choice, from trespassing to repurposing the terminal.

The final renunciation—choosing redirection over escape—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the town won’t get its spaceport back. Her stoic competence is balanced by genuine struggle, especially in tracing travelers’ desperation as physical graffiti.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scribe’s internal conflict—between obedience to the elders and fidelity to his abandoned dream—is rendered through embodied contradiction: trembling fingers, excruciating gentleness, stillness that “bears weight.” His final act of reassembly isn’t a tidy epiphany but a renunciation earned by years of silence, with visible cost in the fractured forecourt and scattered gears.

His motivation—to map absences—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward the final renunciation: not boarding the ship but becoming a cartographer of in-between spaces. The prince’s defiance in the locket portrait functions as a mirror, not a crutch, deepening Elias’s resolve without over-explaining. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in soil, thread, and tide.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prince Aldric’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is embodied through tactile, specific actions (assembling tools, piercing the egg) and layered with contradiction: hope vs. certainty of failure, reverence vs. desperation. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests physically (“fingers trembled,” “hands shook harder”) and morally (“tampering with a genesis already doomed”). The final renunciation isn’t of his goal but of naive expectations—beauty need not be effortless—which is earned by every prior beat. His flaw (idealism bordering on obsession) directly enables the climax without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her compassion isn’t abstract but enacted through precise gestures (binding the wound with the same red thread used for the coin).

    Liora’s interiority is vividly embodied—her skepticism, trauma, and defiance cohere in micro-choices like pressing the box to the door despite disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    The carver’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief manifests in physical tremors, choked silence, and the chisel slip that mirrors his unvoiced scream. His contradiction—carving names yet yearning to shape absence—is active throughout, culminating in a credible, costly shift: hollowing the stone instead of etching it. The spectral father doesn’t resolve his pain but reframes it, enabling an Earned Stasis that forecloses mere memorialization. Every micro-choice (unspooling the ribbon, accepting the butterfly) reveals a hierarchy of values centered on communal remembrance over solitary mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt, silence, and moral precision manifest through tactile actions (carving names, pressing the rake to the bob) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)

Veyra’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is razor-sharp—truth as moral obligation, not vanity—and his emotionally rational demeanor cracks just enough (pulse betraying him) to feel human. His final choice to expose the pattern, not just the Codex, emerges from consistent values under pressure.
