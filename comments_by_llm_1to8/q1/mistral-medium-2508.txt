    Elias's transformation from performance-driven scientist to patient observer is earned through concrete details (butterfly dust, mapping decay patterns), with his final choice to take sabbatical carrying clear professional cost. The internal contradiction between his neutron star expertise and greenhouse attachment creates authentic tension, though some emotional transitions feel slightly accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Liora's internal conflict between creation and unmaking drives genuine choices with embodied cost, particularly in "the frost had shown her one thing: the pauses were where the truth lived." The brother revelation forces contradictory impulses (pursuit vs. letting go) that play out through concrete action. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("purpose was something you could melt and mold") and the final sections trending toward philosophical summary rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief (salt in veins, bleeding fingers) and contradictory impulses—honoring her mentor while defying the storm's silence. The choice to "sail back into the storm, not to escape it, but to play it" shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in the middle sections ("raw, unshaken marvel") that briefly dilutes the concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as the stubborn undertaker who "buried the dead in a place where the sea had already claimed the living" is beautifully embodied through concrete actions and the visceral warmth of the lens calling "through his bones." His final choice to add his own name to the ledger while understanding "rest wasn't the absence of movement" demonstrates earned character evolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's character arc from reluctant leader to silent orchestrator is earned through concrete actions—the midnight runs, teaching Liora, accepting communal knowledge of his identity. The internal contradiction between wanting anonymity and needing visibility crystallizes in his choice to ring publicly, with visible cost in the burned arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—trembling fingers, the jade pressed to sternum, breath forming shapes. The internal contradiction between physician's duty and emotional connection lands, though the revelation of his past life as a physician arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to "unbuild" and find "the texture of time" drives consistent choices through maze navigation and photograph interaction, with embodied stress ("bones ached," "breath ragged"). The final renunciation of solving for the center in favor of designing edges shows earned change with visible cost. Internal contradiction between escape and understanding operates throughout, though some philosophical articulation ("texture wasn't something to discover...to survive") edges toward diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's patient, strategic nature drives authentic choices throughout, from the methodical key decoding to deliberately dropping the guard into the pit. Her motivation is embodied through concrete actions rather than stated, and the final choice to scatter seeds "where the wind and the hungry would find them" reveals character through tactical decision. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in reflection ("grace so staggering it looked like surrender").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to collect absences and his relationship with inherited loss create genuine internal tension, particularly in how he processes grief through synesthetic perception. The final choice to let the colors "drown him" and "fill the absences" represents earned acceptance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the color of a promise kept too long") that occasionally distances from embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Liora's obsession with "illuminated moments" drives consistent choices throughout, though her transformation from thief to temporal essence feels slightly unearned. The stationmaster functions adequately as pressure but lacks depth beyond his cryptic warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between abandonment and return manifests concretely through physical actions—wiping frost, tracing dead switches, turning valves. The shift from preserving her father's failed sanctuary to creating something "fragile enough to matter" shows earned transformation with visible cost in leaving the bookmark behind.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation crystallizes through concrete details—the bleeding palm, the phobia she's conquered professionally, the betrayal that erases her legal existence. The child character applies immediate pressure that forces Lena to act despite her vulnerability. Minor deduction for the child's somewhat convenient appearance and cryptic knowledge ("They lied to you too") that feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eldrin's obsession with collecting silences drives concrete actions throughout—tracing gold leaf, pressing palm to stone, letting the booklet scatter. His final dissolution into "another layer of quiet" represents earned renunciation with visible cost (loss of human form). Internal contradictions between preserving and releasing manifest in physical gestures, though some moments edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    X-7's transformation from maintenance protocols to existential questioning drives genuine character evolution with embodied detail ("servos whirring softly," "optical lenses dimmed"). The final renunciation of its janitor identity for remembered selfhood carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "thoughts" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation crystallizes through concrete action (drawing cryptic doodles as truth-telling) with embodied detail in the lens-pressing gesture. The shift from "mistrust" to clarity lands with earned resonance, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally dramatized in scene rather than summarized ("mistrust thawed").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vine dresser's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—polishing cracked marbles as commemoration—and her internal conflict between loving the garden "too openly" versus conforming to measurable metrics creates genuine tension. The final choice to teach rather than defend shows earned character evolution, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("Small victories, she thought") rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - proving time moves sideways drives his unauthorized actions. His mechanical warmth and patient expertise ground the character effectively. The final choice to "step through" time rather than measure it shows earned transformation, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation emerges through embodied details (cello damp against thigh, tracing warped paper "soft as skin") and contradictory impulses. The desire to "disrupt the careful order of things left unsaid" creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "lately inspired" setup that takes time to ground in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal contradiction between being "fault-tolerant" yet trembling at barometric shifts creates genuine complexity. Her final choice to walk into the storm rather than warn the others emerges from established character logic—she's lived "in the margins" where certainties sway. The fever-weakened state and the smudged illustration work as concrete manifestations of her internal uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to verify his father's cryptic confession drives concrete choices, particularly his decision to turn the valve wheel despite mounting dread. The contradictory impulses between skepticism ("honed by years of watching his mother light candles to saints who never answered") and compulsion play out through embodied actions. The final shift from fleeing to carrying the wheel shows earned character change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper's motivation to dissolve into regenerative silence is consistently embodied through concrete actions—pressing the origami swan, syncing breath with the refuge's pulse, folding endless paper birds. Internal contradiction between the need to witness and the desire to dissolve creates authentic tension, though the final transformation into "something else" could use more specific embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's characterization is grounded in specific, embodied details ("tuning fork in his pocket," "fingers always itching") and his therapeutic patience feels earned through backstory. The shift from professional competence to vulnerable participation during the eclipse shows genuine complexity. Minor deduction for Lila's relatively thin presence as catalyst rather than full character.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as the last historian collecting stories is clear and intensifies through his physical interaction with the tapestry, feeling the displacement "like a hook behind his ribs." His internal experience is richly embodied through sensory detail ("fingers light on the ladder rungs," pressing the tapestry to his cheek). The final choice to leave the silo carrying the tapestry shows earned progression, though the exact nature of his transformation could be more decisively rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions - copying specs onto fortune slips, orchestrating information flow through vague-yet-cutting fortunes. The final choice to leave after twenty years carries visible cost ("the lighthouse dark behind him"). Internal contradiction between not believing in fate while writing prophetic fortunes creates authentic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The priest's choice to illuminate rather than exorcise creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost (his dissolution into indigo). However, the possession entity remains underdeveloped as pressure, and emotional embodiment relies on abstract concepts ("unraveled stillness") rather than concrete sensation in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Li Wei's internal contradiction between his role as oracle and his homesickness drives credible micro-choices, particularly his decision to finally "conduct" rather than merely write. The character's embodied emotions through specific memories (mother's sewing machine, father's fishing boat) avoid therapy-speak, though the final conducting gesture risks slight abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's weightlessness and relationship to gravity creates a consistent character-specific trait that drives the central conflict. The confrontation with his shadow-self demonstrates contradictory impulses acting in scene ("*'Not this time.'* He lunged."), though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the merger. Internal consistency holds throughout, with clear motivation to conquer the fractured selves.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's deafness creates a compelling internal contradiction between his role as music teacher and his relationship to sound, with his journey from numbness to renewed purpose earned through concrete sensory discovery. The drum maker functions effectively as catalyst, though her wisdom feels slightly convenient. The final choice to teach feeling over hearing emerges naturally from his cavern experience, with visible cost in his broken needle transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—discipline warring with curiosity when reaching for the message tube—act effectively in scene. His choice to record silence rather than pursue the presence shows earned renunciation with visible cost ("for the first time, Elias Vey wasn't sure he wanted to be found"). Interior specificity is strong, though the final beat could embody the emotional cost more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's "aromatically cautious" trait drives concrete choices throughout, and his transformation from feeding the Luminara with grief to walking away shows earned change with visible cost. The internal contradiction between protecting himself from scents and carrying his mother's vial creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany timing when he understands the flowers feed on tears.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet's characterization emerges through concrete choices (stealing bread to leave poems, choosing to pull the rope rather than walk away), and his "ethically playful" nature manifests in specific actions. The final choice to carve a ladder shows agency with visible cost (burning hands), though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than described.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation through loss and artistic dedication is clear and embodied through concrete details like calloused fingers and the unfinished melody. The girl's arrival forces a micro-choice between solitude and connection, with Liora choosing to teach rather than preserve her isolation—a meaningful shift earned by her established loneliness. Minor deduction for the girl's somewhat convenient appearance lacking deeper causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradiction between Liora's professional detachment and empathetic absorption of the chemist's pain, with the final choice to give him truth rather than comfort earning real cost. The chemist's transformation from seeking counterfeit to accepting raw truth is viscerally rendered through tears for "the man he'd been when she loved him."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through specific embodied details (the heavy pocket, watching the librarian's precision), and his internal contradiction between profit-seeking and sentiment manifests concretely through the kept locket. The revelation about the librarian's connection to the locket feels slightly convenient, though the final choice to partner lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Reed's motivation to find connection through creation is embodied in her hands remembering marsh reeds and her carving "kin from what others discarded." The contradiction between her solitary search and communal goal creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where Syl appears exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elspeth's motivation through her quest to preserve/understand the moths is clear and embodied through concrete actions like painting and pursuing echoes. The boy character applies immediate pressure effectively. However, the resolution lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands—her choice to pull the thread feels too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conjurer's internal contradiction between his mathematical approach to grief and the inherent ambiguity of loss creates genuine tension, particularly in "He'd been gently inventive once—crafting charms that coaxed laughter from stone." The embodied emotion through physical interaction with the mosaic and glass eyes grounds the abstraction effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's seventeen years of patient caching and his contradictory impulse to remain hidden while needing to reach out creates genuine internal tension that drives his rule-breaking choice. The woman's recognition of her own childhood laugh and subsequent emotional response feels earned through specific embodied details ("her hand flew to her mouth," "breath hitched"). Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("something raw and bright") in peak moments rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's transformation from scientific observer to surrendering participant is earned through concrete embodied moments—her hands shaking at the microscope, standing barefoot in mud. The internal contradiction between her need to understand/control and the tree's invitation to release is dramatized through action, though some moments edge toward diagnostic clarity ("This wasn't adaptation. This was metamorphosis.").

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's exhaustion and artistic stagnation create genuine internal contradiction—his wry acceptance of the island's "waiting" against his decade of searching for meaning shows layered motivation. The transformation from skeptical pragmatist to someone who embraces the inexplicable feels earned through accumulated detail, though the amber woman encounter could use more embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's transformation from seeking to see the future to understanding presence is earned through concrete interaction with the entity, with visible cost in abandoning her lifelong practice. The contradictory impulses (trembling yet reaching, laughing at revelation) act simultaneously in scene, though the entity itself lacks sufficient pressure as a secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to compile fragments is consistently embodied through concrete actions (tracing salt-crusted edges, assembling ledger, pressing valve to lips). The final choice to give away the valve shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("heartened" feels slightly forced) but character arc lands powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's obsessive need for precision as a defense against grief provides clear, consistent motivation that intensifies through his confession "I don't know where she went." The internal contradiction between mapping everything and accepting unknowability drives genuine struggle. Minor deduction for the sister's slightly convenient wisdom at closure, though the emotional cost of acknowledgment lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's skepticism-to-belief arc is earned through concrete embodied moments (tile warming against wrist, hands tracing symbols) with visible cost in accepting her brother's loss. Internal contradiction plays out effectively as she simultaneously scoffs at magic while desperately needing its promise. The final renunciation of skepticism carries weight, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("grief couldn't reach").

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysander's immortal boredom crystallizes into genuine curiosity through the amulet's influence, with his final act of letting go earning real transformation. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in his simultaneous desire for novelty and fear of true change. The cost—surrendering his accumulated certainties—registers viscerally when he realizes "he had been holding his breath for millennia."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her desire to find "the equation for a trade that didn't rot," with concrete internal conflict shown through her hesitation before writing. The girl character provides immediate pressure that forces Lira's choice. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution of debt dissolution without fully embodied emotional cost in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stationer's motivation to collect "textures" of time is clear and consistent, driving his meticulous documentation. However, the character lacks genuine internal conflict or contradiction—his studious nature never wavers or costs him anything meaningful. The discovery of Elara Voss creates curiosity but no real stakes or difficult choices that would elevate characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Daniel's erasure-driven collecting compulsion builds through concrete embodied details (fingers tracing steel, label "humming against his palm"), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in his need to gather versus dissolve. The final choice to press fragments into steel and step forward costs him literal existence, earned through prior establishment of his ghostlike state.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory nature as "myth buster, accidental poet of half-truths" creates genuine internal tension, and his final transformation from debunker to myth keeper is earned through embodied struggle with the cello and shell. The "gloomy cheerfulness" manifests in his jagged laugh while "secretly praying for [a miracle]," though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("the compass in his chest").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's internal contradiction between loving Lumina's chaos and her mainland "order" conditioning drives genuine complexity, with the foundation chip embodying her guilt. The final choice to embed the chip in paint shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dual allegiance gnawed") but contradictory impulses act in scene throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the grain of sand as temporal anchor, his methodical documentation against erasure. His choice to plant the canister shows agency under pressure, though the internal conflict could sharpen further. The final acceptance ("that had to be enough") lands as earned resignation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation flows from embodied perception—fingers tracing surfaces, reading vibrations through boots, interpreting water ripples—creating a coherent character whose blindness enhances rather than limits his expertise. The final choice to intervene carries clear cost (anonymity, energy) earned through thirty years of accumulated skill. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of his detection.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's transformation from observer-editor to herald is earned through concrete discovery—the condensation patterns, Kael's journal, the phrasebook page—with embodied tension ("hands that didn't tremble" belying inner recognition). The final acceptance carries visible cost: dissolving into the lake's consciousness, surrendering her cartographic certainty for mythic becoming.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tuner's motivation through patient rhythm and the town's gradual awakening create a coherent character arc with embodied stakes. Internal consistency holds as he synchronizes with the town's revival, though the final child's laughter feels slightly unearned given the established ghostly atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's guilt-driven journey to harness the hush shows clear motivation with embodied details like "the taste of iron in her mouth as she clawed through the rubble." The internal contradiction between fleeing and confronting her guilt drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient transformation at closure where guilt dissolves too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with Elias's physical engagement with the lattice and lighthouse, contradictory impulses between fear and determination shown through action. The transformation from inheriting his father's legacy of lies to speaking truth lands with visible cost—the disbelief he'll face. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("burned like a secret") rather than full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation as "hunger" rather than memory creates compelling embodied desire, and her excavation metaphor ("her love for Vesper the chisel, her grief the mallet") grounds abstract longing in physical action. The keeper's weary acceptance adds texture, though Vesper remains more symbolic than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—his sleepwalking as both literal movement and metaphorical weaving creates genuine complexity. The "haunting optimism of a man who had spent his life mending what others called lost" drives authentic choices. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about the labyrinth-as-loom, though it's earned through prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is grounded in belief in roots over miracles, with embodied details like "hands calloused from foreign labor but his heart still light." The internal progression from skepticism to laughter feels earned through accumulated discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the dream-to-reality transition.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's motivation as a pseudonym creator is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing chalk, using the clipboard's algorithms, testing "Mizuho" aloud). The moment of hesitation before mailing shows internal conflict, though the emotional stakes of her own chosen name could deepen the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve truth through embroidery is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "his fingers tracing constellations only he could name." The internal contradiction between disguising wisdom as foolishness while broadcasting truth creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the courier's underdeveloped presence and some abstract phrasing around "adjacent possibilities" that lacks full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between holding and releasing manifests through embodied details—the letter "soft as a pulse," the shard pressed to create controlled pain. The final choice to release the letter carries visible cost through years of accumulated silence, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the moment before deciding").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's translator identity drives concrete choices—decrypting the child's crayon marks and reframing grief through negative space reading. Her embodied pain (ribs singing, shrapnel memory) creates authentic internal contradiction against her healer role. The boy encounter earns its resolution through her specific method of reading absence, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("unknotting fear like a cipher").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to restore lost joy through light-painting is embodied through concrete actions (bottled light, film development, public display). The final choice to share the memory publicly carries visible cost—the film will dissolve by morning. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("grief so deep it felt like grief").

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's motivation to escape certainty drives genuine internal conflict, particularly in her acceptance of cyclical awakening over linear creation. Her micro-choices (painting the door, stepping through) carry visible cost. However, the fig-woman and old man remain functional rather than fully realized, and some emotional transitions feel compressed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in intellectual rebellion, with concrete embodied choices (planting coded messages, teaching others). His "charming rogue scholar" persona drives specific actions under pressure. The ending choice to step "into the chaos they'd grown" shows earned agency, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene rather than described.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet's motivation to transform war's pain into beauty is embodied through concrete actions (pressing postcard to chest, singing to ghosts, eating the manual). Her three-hundred-year insomnia creates genuine exhaustion that drives choices. The soldier ghost interaction reveals character through contrasting interpretations of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's thirty-year dedication to preservation creates genuine internal conflict when her act of repair awakens something dangerous, forcing her to destroy what she's spent a lifetime protecting. The contradiction between her preservationist nature and final destructive choice lands with earned cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("museum of extinct feelings").

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her penance for past translation harm, with embodied tension in "fingers still vibrating with the language's pulse." The transformation from guilt-driven scholar to someone who "trusted the sound of her own voice" is earned through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("carefully reckless") without sufficient embodied demonstration in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between building unyielding gates or embracing the machinist's compassionate system drives authentic tension, with her final choice earned through the discovered blueprint's revelation. The embodied details—fingers tracing grooves, breath misting, chain coiled "like a promise"—ground her emotional progression. Minor deduction for the elders being somewhat stock authority figures, though their "faces set like mortar" and the woman with "eyes like cracked flint" add specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between his need for silence and yearning for music drives authentic choices throughout. His physical trembling with the letter, steady hands only with birds, and final decision to hum despite rust show embodied emotion under pressure. The transformation from flinching at silence to not flinching carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("featherly determined" physicalized effectively) and contradictory impulses acting in scene when Elias both wants to scream at Liora and understands her necessity. The final choice to join her rather than extract her shows earned character change with visible cost. Slight deduction for Liora's precocious wisdom that borders on convenient child-sage trope.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's characterization achieves specificity through embodied details (adjusting brass eyepiece, fogging lens) and her unique perception of jellyfireflies as Morse code. The moment of connection with Kael feels earned through parallel wonder, though his characterization remains thinner. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recollectionist's discovery that "the missing pieces were never gone. They were inside her all along" represents earned internal change with visible cost (blood glowing iridescent, memories surging into her). Interiority is concrete and embodied through physical interactions with crater glass, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("paths disappeared so new ones could be found").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior's motivation to compose "for the gaps between" people emerges clearly through embodied details like his "lightly attentive gaze" calculating variables. His internal contradiction between seeking pattern and embracing chaos drives the closure, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("Monotony was a canvas") rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tide dancer's motivation crystallizes through embodied ritual—grinding moonstone, pressing dust to skin, writing verse in blood. Internal contradiction between exile and return plays out in scene. The "fledging" transformation lands with visible cost ("her skin was no longer hers alone"), though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("something older").

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's characterization succeeds through embodied ritual and specific gestures (tracing the prism rim, choosing stones by weight). His motivation to find meaning in the mundane after his daughter's departure is earned through concrete details. The internal tension between maintaining faith in his practice and missing his daughter creates authentic complexity, though the resolution could push harder against cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivations are grounded in concrete trauma (fire, lost crew, estranged daughter) with embodied details like "voice like gravel" and fingers tracing parallel scars. The internal conflict between isolation and connection plays out through physical actions with the porcelain box. However, the emotional arithmetic around his transformation feels slightly rushed—the leap from receiving the note to drawing symbols lacks intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's motivation as a "logical dreamer" who seeks equations for hope is consistently embodied through concrete actions—arranging fractals, tracking timelines, working with inherited objects. The character's internal contradiction between logic and dreaming creates genuine tension, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("the space between what was and what could be") rather than staying fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the film negative burning in his pocket, his shaking hands aligning faces with the mural. The final choice to sketch echoes rather than map them shows genuine character evolution with visible cost ("the burden of legacy remained—no longer a chain, but a thread"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of legacy") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's contradictory impulses—helping clients while knowing she steals from others—manifest through concrete action rather than summary, particularly in her deliberate dropping of the mirror before it shows her own face. The final choice to continue her work despite understanding its cost demonstrates earned complexity, though the soldier whose heartbeat is borrowed remains too abstract to fully ground the moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradiction between Veyra's trained steadiness ("operatively gentle") and her internal tremor, with the clipboard's notches physicalizing her history of failed treaties. The moment where Kael reaches for the clipboard with "callouses catching on the ebony's polished grief" shows excellent character-specific perception. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the quiet violence of hope") that briefly escapes embodiment.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("vessel for what the world had tried to erase") that briefly slips into label-speak rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)

The grandfather's lightning-struck stick serves as both talisman and embodied memory, grounding abstract ethical questions in physical gesture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("half-lit epiphanies") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as a "thief of lost knowledge" who exploits grief is crystal clear, with his calculating nature driving every beat. The traveler functions effectively as immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The saxophonist's motivation to silence the prophecy is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "breath curling into morning fog" and playing through "subtraction" rather than sound. His internal conflict between fearing the grotto's pull and needing to return creates genuine tension. The cyclical nature of his relationship with the prophecy—discovering he wrote it himself—earns the Earned Stasis closure, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("the weight of the vested hush") rather than embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation builds from "keeper of broken things" through his understanding of hunger to his final choice to accept immolation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—seeking answers while fearing their absence—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "He didn't fear the dark. He feared the explanations that wouldn't come."

    Elias's motivation as a timekeeper who "couldn't fix his own" time creates genuine internal tension. The embodied details (adjusting the cracked lens, the warm urn fragment) ground his abstract quest.

    Elias's internal conflict between buried talent and its cost drives authentic choices, particularly the crystallized moment of accepting his role as "Keeper of the Unsaid."

    Elian's motivation to navigate grief through the stillpoint is clear and embodied through sensory absorption of languages. The internal journey from raw grief to mapped understanding shows genuine transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "uncharted depths" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's progression from trying to "correct the past" to accepting layered contingency is earned through concrete details like the meteorite pen and wrong seeds. His internal contradiction between seeking certainty and embracing uncertainty manifests in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract introspection that could be more embodied, particularly in the middle passages about "contingent relationships."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradiction between Elias's urgent signing and Liora's measured disruption creates genuine tension. The characters' responses to the faceless entity—Liora lunging forward with the camera, Elias signing a storm—reveal values through action under extreme pressure. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction ("quiet charisma wrapping around them like a cloak") in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradiction between destroying and preserving drives genuine complexity, with his final choice to burn again carrying visible cost ("volcanic tenderness erupting"). The self-vandalism-as-map revelation earns its weight through prior setup. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the weight of unspoken vows") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira's internal conflict between being a "vault of auroral sorrow" and her desire for autonomy drives clear motivation, with embodied details like "fingers twitched, drumming a restless rhythm." The transformation from passive victim to active agent releasing memories shows genuine change with visible cost. However, some moments lean toward abstract emotional summary ("vault of auroral sorrow") rather than fully embodied contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception—his reading of walks as confessions and the grandmother's coin as anchor. The final choice between leaving versus staying to listen demonstrates earned internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for the woman's underdeveloped presence despite her catalytic role.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's silent, patient presence and the boy's internal struggle create authentic tension through embodied details like "hands trembled when he tied his fishing line."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation coheres well through concrete actions (pawn in pocket, iron filings dancing) and his chess-coach patience translates effectively to orchestrating resistance. The contradiction between teaching foresight and facing immediate threat creates genuine tension. Deduction for some abstract interiority ("forests of second thoughts") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's transformation from dock worker to whale-form is earned through concrete sensory details (scrimshaw warming against thigh, ribs aching to expand) and the final choice to follow carries visible cost in abandoning his human life. Internal contradiction works through his body remembering "a shape he'd forgotten" while his conscious mind stops asking why.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's contradictory impulses—clutching dried flowers while whittling them away—embody grief's paradox effectively. The scream as raw release against performed stillness earns its emotional cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "remade hush pressed into bones" early on, but the character work recovers strongly through concrete gesture and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation is grounded in the visceral need for "the tremor of certainty" and her transformation from respecting boundaries to dissolving them is earned through concrete sensory experience. The contradiction between seeking certainty and then rejecting it as "just another boundary" creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "edges dissolving" that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias's colorblindness creating a unique perceptual world ("colors had never been the point") and his plant language system show strong character specificity. The relationship with Liora develops through concrete actions (basil pot, dandelion, teaching moment) with embodied tension. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("Beginning," "made sense") in closure beats that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's pilgrimage motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the lens and bells, though her internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate the score. The final renunciation ("She left it there") carries visible cost as she abandons the physical artifact for a conceptual connection, earning the closure through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong grief embodiment through concrete action (wire-twisting, sleepless crafting) and contradictory impulses (creating/releasing). The transformation from closed lily to open crane with distributed ritual shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("grief coiled tight") and the slightly convenient emotional resolution by winter.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation as a pattern-reader adapting to post-crash reality is clear and consistent, with his methodical approach to "reverse engineering" cultural collapse driving concrete choices. The woman's revelation about her brother adds genuine emotional complexity. However, internal conflict remains mostly implicit rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final choice to "trace the distances between" raindrops lacks the visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The historian's internal contradiction between seeking and releasing knowledge drives authentic choices, particularly in turning the pagoda "counterclockwise, the way of unmaking." Her embodied fear ("recoiled, then steadied herself") and the visceral cost of transformation earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's sharp observation skills drive her discovery and the crucial decision to trade her shadow, with contradictory impulses (protection vs. curiosity) acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between his grifter past and genuine desire for redemption manifests through concrete micro-choices (leaving real medicine, writing to victims). The chameleon healing parallels his self-reconstruction effectively. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated self-awareness in moments like "the fragile conviction that he could outrun his past."

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses ("wanted to read it the way she read the coffee rings") and earned final renunciation. The protagonist's shift from closure-seeker to question-carrier shows genuine cost through the mother's file revelation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation to find "where unused love went to die" drives consistent choices through psychometry and film manipulation, with embodied tension in her breath catching and fingers trembling. The final renunciation (letting the dark have its say) carries visible cost as she releases both the search and the stored love. Interiority is concrete ("space between her ribs where she'd stored him") though some passages lean toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's transformation from blocked artist to creative conduit is earned through embodied struggle ("the weight in her chest lightened"). The "moonstruck dreamer" characterization drives her choices consistently. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("shadowed rapture seized her") rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hollow's transformation from dreamless guardian to spark-carrier is earned through embodied details like "fingers brushed the clock's face" and the weight paradox of holding "nothing and everything."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philosopher's transformation from wandering seeker to embodied understanding shows clear internal progression with contradictory impulses (seeking vs. becoming). The final renunciation of wandering carries visible cost through abandoning the gear. Minor deduction for some abstract passages that lean toward philosophical summary rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal contradiction between duty and staying crystallizes effectively through embodied details like the punch's weight and the star imprint on her palm. The final renunciation—letting the punch arc into the shallows—carries visible cost as she forecloses her ferryman identity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the courage that waits") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's twenty years of silent service and numb arm create clear motivation for his choice to listen rather than maintain silence. The pianist's sewn lips and burned face embody the cost of the unpardonable silence viscerally. Internal contradiction between duty and recognition drives the decisive final choice, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veythas's three-hundred-year resistance to the warnings followed by action creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost (sacrificing Lirien's name).

Minor deduction for the pretender's underdeveloped presence and somewhat abstract emotional processing in places.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation crystalizes through concrete details—the torn atlas page, the tapping rhythm, her grandmother's teachings—building to an earned choice between institutional safety and ancestral knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's "awkward confidence" manifests through concrete embodied actions (barefoot navigation, pressing palm to stones) and her internal contradiction between desperation and certainty drives the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied moments—fingers testing heat, hands coaxing stubborn soil, the amber pendant suddenly feeling alive. Her internal conflict between tradition and transformation plays out through specific choices (refusing to replant the grove exactly, unlocking rather than shattering the amber), with the final reconciliation with her grandson earning its emotional weight through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's internal contradiction between wanting to hate the tourists and letting them misread the photograph as a bird shows genuine complexity. The embodied pause technique ("press your palms into your thighs until the sting overrides the echo of screams") grounds her trauma response in specific physical action. Her final choice to prune deadwood while leaving "the rest to grow" earns its resonance through prior dramatization of grief and the cypress leaf ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's transformation from artist seeking to capture light to becoming "the canvas" and "the brushstroke" shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Her internal conflict between holding/releasing manifests concretely through the tarot reconstruction, and the final surrender carries emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—the "milky eyes burned with serene anger" and his physical transformation from using the ink. The internal contradiction between hunting and understanding lands with earned weight, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("Time didn't slow in crisis, he realized. It *fractured*") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between duty and truth conviction drives the entire arc with embodied tension ("pulse scandalized the stillness"). The decisive choice to release classified information demonstrates clear motivation rooted in years of "bravely conflicted" record-keeping, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("the cathedral of secrets"). Final martyrdom lands with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between leaving (father's voice) and staying (roses' need) creates genuine tension through embodied details like pressing thorns into palm and tasting salt/rust on sandbag fabric.

    The fisher's motivation through grief and pursuit of his daughter's voice is embodied through concrete actions (tracing grooves, driving the spike, digging) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—holding to cool-headed discipline while feeling the pull of memory. The final renunciation ("This one, he let go") carries visible emotional cost earned through thirty years of pursuit, though some interior passages lean toward summary rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lydia's internal conflict between regret and action drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to break the "orbit" by publishing despite implicating her father. The characterization earns its closure through accumulated details (cufflinks, mother's pen, father's ledgers) that constrain her final choice with visible familial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's guilt manifests through embodied detail—the constellation scars, the warming amber, her shaking hands at the crib. The final choice to "reach for the baby" and not stop represents earned agency through accumulated pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "guilt and grace could finally share the same air" which edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lior's motivation to preserve rather than erase is clear and consistent, with embodied reactions like "pulse stuttered" and concrete choices to listen/draw rather than scrub.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—tracing tesserae while haunted by specific memories. The commander's transformation shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("The sword clattered to the ground").

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lydia's synesthetic perception creates distinctive interiority ("taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin's first trembling note"), and Elias's suicidal despair is embodied through gesture and stance. The choice to pass the coin carries visible cost—Lydia accepts her role as "ghost in the wings" rather than star. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory/possibility that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's affectionate skepticism creates genuine internal contradiction (kissing cat but scoffing at horoscopes), and her choice to paint rather than immediately follow Mira shows agency with visible cost. The motivation to "illuminate" pathways drives concrete action through the sliver-pressing sequence. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("ego dissolution") and the slightly convenient arrival of the sliver without stronger causality.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("too exhausted to speak for itself") that briefly weakens embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied contradiction between prudence and daring plays out through concrete micro-choices (keeping the pillbox, hesitating to open it, ultimately leaving it behind). The burned spy's trauma manifests physically ("burns on her cheek, the way her left eye no longer quite tracked") and shapes present behavior. Minor deduction for the man remaining somewhat generic despite his narrative importance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's patient vigilance driven by cryptic instructions creates genuine tension through embodied waiting and micro-choices (fingers twitching toward parchment, not reins).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter's motivation through "phototropic to kindness" drives his return to the ruins and shapes his bowl-making ritual with the embedded glass. His internal conflict between seeing fractures vs. graveyard manifests through concrete actions (tracing bowl rim, following sun patterns, embedding the shard). The final realization that "resistance wasn't refusal. It was remembrance" feels earned through his patient craft and observation, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's internal contradiction between keeping drafts and believing secrets should be rejoined creates genuine tension. The moment she places her own spiral shows earned change through concrete action. However, some interiority veers toward abstract philosophy ("points of light that needed someone else to draw the lines") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's contradictory impulses—caution warring with hope, professional exile against cosmic engagement—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her hesitation over the transmit switch. Her final choice to interfere carries visible professional and existential cost ("I was just fixing the radio" understatement shows awareness of consequences). The embodied stress ("fingers that remembered every notch," "teeth ache") grounds her internal conflict effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that compounds under pressure in the shaft descent, with embodied fear ("lungs tightened," "breath turned traitor") driving his choice to continue despite terror.

They were meant to be *remade*").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's face-blindness creates a compelling perceptual signature that shapes every interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to redeem his great-grandfather drives concrete choices with embodied tension ("fingers trembled...not from the cold, but from the *knowing*").

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to seek "amnesty" from his own story is established through concrete details (bridge songs that make rivers stutter) and his transformation from observer to participant feels earned. The final merger with the song shows genuine cost—loss of self—but the interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("sculpted from the ashes of 'never'") rather than embodied emotion during the crucial choice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's internal contradiction between inherited instinct and philosophical distance creates genuine tension, particularly in "his father's instincts still hummed in his fingertips" while choosing understanding over theft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation through her scars-as-maps conceit is viscerally embodied, with contradictory impulses (root-bound yet visionary) acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liam's internal contradiction between assigning value while questioning his own worth creates genuine complexity, embodied through physical gestures (tracing cloth, folding it into palm). The "confidently uncertain" trait manifests concretely in his appraisal work and personal stance. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "Maybe purpose wasn't something you found" reflection that edges toward diagnostic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's grief-driven pursuit crystallizes through concrete details like "hands steady as a metronome" and the embodied absence of the spirit. The final choice to return "not to stay, but to understand" demonstrates earned acceptance with visible cost—he experiences his wife alive yet must leave again.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal contradictions manifest beautifully through the brass dials "ticking quiet rebellion" and his paradoxical relationship with the creel's objects.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers tracing the peeling map," "pressed his forehead to the patched leather").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (watch burning against ribs, trembling hands) and culminates in a earned renunciation of the cipher for direct communication.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with concrete sensory detail ("the violin's cold seeping into her bones," "breath fogging the air") and layered motivation between contract obligation and moral stance. The protagonist's gift creates genuine internal conflict acted out through micro-choices (touching the violin, reading coffee stains, ultimately destroying it). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "destiny already perforated" that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's dual profession (beautician/mortician) creates compelling internal tension, and her ability to "read" the aurora's static language shows specific, earned expertise. The protagonist makes a decisive choice to reach through the threshold, accepting the weight of carrying messages for the dead. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "lucidly watchful" trait that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization through concrete details ("hands still rough from decades") and the scalloped bandage gesture at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to teach through withholding is grounded in specific memories (grandfather's orchard) and embodied through his reverse-aging meditation, with internal contradictions playing out in scene. The final choice to step into the grotto carries visible cost as he leaves the platform's safety. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around truth/vanishing that edges toward philosophy-speak rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skimmer's motivation to preserve ancestral knowledge while facing extinction creates genuine internal tension, particularly in his choice to become "anchor" rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's obsession with the color of sound drives concrete choices throughout, from wading into cold shallows to lighting his own lantern in the frozen sky. His final understanding that truth must be "made" rather than found shows earned transformation with visible cost—the Marigold sinking deeper, his lantern forever changed.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal journey from pattern-seeker to cosmic architect is well-motivated through concrete choices (arranging coins, dissolving into frequency). The "quietly enthusiastic" trait manifests in her methodical approach to the prophecy. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("the illusion of forward momentum") that could be more embodied, but the final choice to reverse entropy carries genuine cost—she alone remembers the end.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's motivation to "give shapes" to formless fears is clear and drives the entire piece. His hollowness from reaping his own heart creates genuine internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details ("fingers tracing the cracks," "hands trembled," "worked until his fingers bled") and his internal contradiction between being dismissed as "earnestly naive" yet possessing deep observational wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's split consciousness drives genuine internal conflict through embodied details (the jar pulsing, blood ritual) and his final choice to merge carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's character shows consistent motivation through his philosophy of "the stretch of a mind pressing against its own edges," embodied in specific actions from room design to seed cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyssa's characterization emerges through embodied details like "her teeth ached" and the concrete action of waiting as both keeper and prisoner. The final choice to surrender the pendant and accept dissolution shows contradictory impulses (terror/familiarity) acting simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "dimensionally homesick" concept of the books, though this is mitigated by the visceral "shouting" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation through "unproductive obsession" and the hunger to prove himself drives consistent choices, with contradictory impulses (feeding the crozier memories vs. doubt) acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation earns its cost through prior causality—his scars literally unmade. Minor deduction for the guildmaster's dialogue feeling slightly diagnostic ("Some men are born to tend fires, not light them").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation coheres through concrete embodied details like "fingers brushing the hollywood star fragment" and her methodological approach of "discarding assumptions." The final leap represents earned transformation through accumulated understanding, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the sound of the universe listening to itself").

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's competence and experience create authentic authority through concrete actions (coiling rope, adjusting the wheel to "align" timelines). Her choice to merge timelines shows clear motivation rooted in her understanding of the grotto's rules. Minor deduction for the passengers' emotional states being somewhat abstractly rendered rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as "fever dream architect" is concrete and consistent, with the sinew thread of memories providing specific embodiment. The final choice to begin again with the woman shows earned endurance. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around connection that could be more embodied ("the texture of connection").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira's "balancedly curious" trait drives her to bridge two navigation systems, with concrete embodiment through her handling of the chain link and teaching method. The shift from "reckless" to essential shows earned character evolution. Minor deduction for Kael's underdevelopment and some abstraction in emotional states ("somber marvel," "hungry eyes").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias's curiosity-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like adjusting frequencies and following signals. The revelation of the child being him creates meaningful cost through identity reconfiguration. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution of memory recovery without exploring deeper psychological implications.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's claustrophobia provides genuine internal conflict against his compulsion to descend, creating embodied tension ("his pulse hammering; the weight of the earth above him was a living thing"). The transformation from fear to understanding ("who had always been afraid of small spaces, now understood") is earned through his experience with the phase transition, though the exact nature of what he carries back remains purposefully oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's internal contradiction between fearing her counted heartbeats will stop and needing to fix the "error" drives authentic tension. The shift from isolation to connection lands with earned cost through her three-year struggle with bureaucratic death. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the digital ghost's consciousness emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra's copper-veined inheritance and ancestral hunger create clear motivation that drives her fatal choice to answer the echoes. The moment where "the copper in her veins burned with the same hunger that had driven her ancestors" effectively shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, the transformation into echo happens too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle, and her final realization "You were never meant to understand" arrives as convenient wisdom rather than earned through dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong character transformation from bitter researcher to something beyond human, with contradictory impulses (bitterness vs. cosmic acceptance) acting in scene. The final choice to "let the joke rewrite him" carries visible cost—loss of human form—though some interior beats lean toward abstract ("bitterness had become his religion") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The violinist's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—pressing the locust shell to her chest, playing "not with her hands, but with the locust shell," stepping onto soil with bare feet. Her final choice to walk "into the heart of the grove, where the future was already blooming" shows earned transformation with visible cost (the melting statues, the abandoned sky-bridge).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystalizes through concrete details—the frayed cap, learned drone patterns, and "respectfully rebellious" self-definition create a coherent character whose final choice to deliver "again and again" feels earned. The contradiction between official postal worker and smuggler operates in scene, though Lira remains somewhat underdeveloped as pure receptor rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lior's silence as active choice rather than inability creates genuine character depth, with contradictory impulses visible when he opens his mouth but produces no sound, then shapes air into melody. The final renunciation of speech for building doors shows earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (mother's scarf, chalk equations) and his shift from hoarding fragments to understanding memories as "spaces to step into" earns the final renunciation. The internal contradiction between preservation and reawakening drives genuine tension, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("sanctuary," "fossil of someone's fleeting clarity").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian's motivation to vitalize escaped dreams is clear and consistent, with internal contradiction between preserving order and allowing freedom crystallizing in her choice to let the dream dissolve. Her micro-choice to whisper "Stay" instead of returning the dream reveals values hierarchy with visible cost. Slight deduction for the dream-woman's underdeveloped agency and some abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") that verges on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith's internal progression from following rules ("Never open what you cannot close") to understanding that "the boldest act wasn't opening, but letting the locked thing decide" creates genuine character evolution with visible cost. The moment where she recognizes her own mother's similar binding and the decade spent learning to open such things grounds her motivation in concrete personal history. Minor deduction for the man's underdeveloped presence and some abstract phrasing ("the hush of cosmic possibility") that edges toward label-speak rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's compulsive pursuit despite personal cost creates genuine tension, with embodied details like "skin prickle" and the physical weight of memories returning. The memory eater wearing a friend's face delivers earned betrayal. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient final exchange lacking fuller embodiment of the confrontation's emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization with Elspeth's backwards-walking habit and Kael's trembling hands revealing internal states. The mentorship dynamic creates genuine pressure through "combative tenderness" - love that doesn't flinch from teeth. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "though the words tasted like a lie" rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to "shape the unseen" drives coherent choices through the veil transition and his decision to sacrifice twilight juice to sharpen the girl's edges. The internal contradiction between his hunger for shaping and his ultimate choice to let wonder pass through him lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for the girl's underdeveloped presence and some abstract phrasing ("insatiable craving") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to release rather than restore emerges clearly through embodied details like "fingers, calloused from years of mending" and the contradiction between his trade and action. The decisive choice to drop the needle carries visible cost ("for the first time, he didn't feel like a restorer"). Internal conflict operates through gesture and silence rather than explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's methodical curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (overlaying films, tracking discrepancies, threading her own reel) with embodied tension ("breath fogging the glass plates"). The final renunciation of proof in favor of listening shows earned wisdom through accumulated observation, though her internal contradiction could be sharper in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between needing answers and letting go creates genuine tension through embodied details like "breath fogged the glass" and the notebook against her ribs. The final renunciation of "the need to know where the falling ended" carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for the sister reference feeling slightly underintegrated.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The balladeer's motivation to translate silence and encode unspoken needs is grounded in his grandmother's legacy and curse of being "seldom-heard," driving his choice to refuse the ghost's possession. Internal conflict manifests physically through the bolt plate's heat and his trembling breath as contradictory impulses (helping vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously. The final renunciation carries visible cost as he walks away leaving "no prints," having foreclosed connection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's warmly inquisitive nature drives authentic micro-choices throughout—unfolding the diary despite resistance, interpreting the cipher as joy measurements, and ultimately climbing toward the light. The transformation from seeing the spire as prison to lens feels earned through accumulated discovery, though the emotional progression could deepen between finding the diary and the final epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to memorialize grief through meteorology is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in his physical interaction with the telescope and gondola. The internal contradiction between scientific observation and poetic desperation creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("poetic desperation," "quiet violence") that could be more embodied, though the final surrender sequence lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist's motivation—pursuing impossible precision while forgetting faces—drives consistent choices through crafting the light installation and finally accepting limitation. Internal contradiction operates throughout (remembering hands vs. forgotten faces), and the final renunciation of her knife for painting "nothing" carries visible cost. Slight deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("despair pressed into a coin") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Liora's curiosity drives meaningful action under pressure, with her pattern-recognition shifting from transgression to salvation. The character shows genuine embodied tension ("breath fogging the glass," "pulse jumped") and makes costly choices that risk captain's anger for potential discovery. However, the crew's instant acceptance of her solution feels slightly unearned given their weeks of grumbling about omens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—fingers aching for "that precise *click*"—and her three-year quest after losing her sister shows genuine cost. Internal contradiction emerges in her working on a mechanism that isn't mechanical but temporal. The final transformation from feeling "out of step" to feeling like "the key" earns its resonance through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, though Kael's ghostly existence lacks embodied specificity beyond flickering edges. The collective's transformation from strangers to family feels earned through concrete actions (repairing channels, stringing lanterns), with visible cost in the fractured land they heal. Internal conflict operates more through accumulation than simultaneous contradiction, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's thirty-year burden and the puppet head's arrival create clear motivation for his final choice to release the stolen moments. The cost—his own erasure from the tapestry—is explicit and felt. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("nested patterns," "vouchsafe") that briefly distances from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's thirteen-year burden and moral complexity around guiding travelers despite prohibition creates genuine internal conflict. The moment she breaks her lifetime of refusing pleas to help the dying girl demonstrates earned character change under pressure. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("who had spent a lifetime refusing pleas") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied grief through concrete details (chrysalis against thigh, breath hitching) and contradictory impulses (building bridges that can't mend what matters). The final choice to wade deeper shows earned transformation through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("atonement wasn't a bridge, it was a dissolution").

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation crystalizes through her philosophy of "stories begin in the pause before the pen," and the patron's hunger for "the glimmering parole" creates genuine tension through contradictory needs. The needle-work scene embodies internal conflict physically as she traces "nothing" to find "something," though the patron remains somewhat abstract despite their crucial role.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to process others' memories through taste is vivid and embodied ("sharp as citrus or thick as burnt caramel"), with internal conflict between drowning in memories and needing to tend them. The final choice to return to the kitchen after unburdening shows earned character movement with visible emotional cost ("For the first time in weeks, he couldn't taste a thing").

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Liora's motivation to heal linguistic fractures through music/language is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (weight warm in pocket, conducting with whole body). However, internal contradiction remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see her decisive empathy but not genuine struggle between competing impulses. The earned change (community singing in harmony) has visible cost but lacks deeper character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's motivation to bridge entangled memories through self-modification is clear and drives the closure with visible cost. The contradiction between her precise engineering mind and chaotic pursuit of buried connections creates genuine tension. However, the emotional specificity of her losses (failed prototypes, lover, never-had child) reads more as catalog than embodied experience, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lysara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—her seventeen years of dedication, the physical tracing of manuscript edges, her urgency during the inversion. The brother revelation provides earned emotional weight, though his convenient appearance in backstory slightly weakens causality. Internal conflict between seeking knowledge and fearing time's limit creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation as a "tree-song sculptor" in a silent world is embodied through specific actions - tracing cracks, strumming fissures, translating wood's lament. His empathy manifests physically through deliberate slowness and refusal to wipe the insulator's tears. The final choice to leave the insulator shows earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between cynicism and hope manifests through concrete micro-choices, particularly his decision to engage with the girl despite years of exile. The worry stone's dent serves as a physical anchor for his acceptance of imperfection. Minor deduction for the girl's somewhat convenient wisdom that occasionally strains plausibility for her age.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to catalog silence builds convincingly through concrete details like ink-stained fingers and the device that "hummed when it found the right frequency of quiet." The shift from passive collecting to active engagement ("for the first time, he wanted to try") earns its weight through the diary's revelation about "The silence of a choice not made." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about empathy not being enough, though it's grounded in the guild's specific history.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" drives consistent choices from theft through acceptance, with embodied contradictions (precise hands vs. hunger) and a meaningful shift from seeking stillness to embracing sway. The transformation earns its cost through her willingness to face the Elders and the village's tacit approval signaled by the unlocked vault.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like touching the broken arrow tip and feeling the moss spread on her skin. The transformation from pilot to "first to hear the planet's true voice" shows meaningful change with visible cost (her mentor's disappearance, the physical transformation). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("resilience wasn't something you found. It was something you *grew*") that edges toward theme-speak in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra's characterization succeeds through embodied fear ("her boot catching on a loose bolt"), professional expertise layered with trauma (the flight engineer's patch), and the decisive choice to abandon documentation for survival. The moment she "didn't document the anomaly" shows genuine character change under pressure, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("feedback loop of pressure and velocity").

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to free rather than constrain the aurora is clearly rooted in her synesthetic gift and rebellion against the elders' fear-based control. Her internal conflict between duty and liberation plays out through embodied sensation ("listened with her skin," "nerves singing as the colors coiled around her wrists"). The final choice to "unfetter" rather than tame carries visible cost—defying the elders and transforming the village's enforced silence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's thirty-year guardianship collapsing into uncertainty creates genuine internal conflict, with his choice to widen rather than seal the breach showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. The child's question "What if you're wrong?" effectively undermines his certainty and drives his final renunciation of guardianship with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's core motivation—seeking "the mathematics of emotion"—drives consistent choices through borrowed personalities to his final acceptance. The transformation from collector to giver lands with visible cost ("let the widow's voice dissolve... let the blacksmith's anger unknot"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courier's transformation from trembling delivery man to carrier of "the hum" shows genuine internal contradiction and embodied emotion. The motivation to find his mentor drives consistent choices through pressure, though some moments of realization ("he understood") arrive too cleanly without sufficient embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses (warmth of prism vs. cold bite of frost, belief in echoes vs. skepticism of ghosts). The final renunciation—hurling the prism—is earned through accumulated pressure and shows visible cost in "shoulders unknotting for the first time in years." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("terrible knowing") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spinner's motivation through loss and sacrifice is consistently embodied through weaving metaphors and physical actions. Internal contradiction between hope and resignation plays out in scene rather than summary. The final choice to dissolve into the forest while sending the message demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The smith's meekness contrasted with "slow-burning" determination creates believable internal complexity, and his final choice to feed silk into the fissure carries genuine risk. However, the villagers remain stock figures, and some emotional transitions (especially the planet's immediate response) feel too smooth for the stakes established.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's sensory mapping ability and internal conflict between resisting/following the pull create genuine tension. The "weight in her chest wasn't fear" crystallizes her values with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of meaning") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's transformation from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated gestures—the daily glass ritual, stone stacking, and eventual written reply. His internal contradiction between wanting solitude and needing connection plays out through embodied actions rather than stated feelings. The final choice to stay and build carries visible cost (letting the skiff rot).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's contradictory nature—laughing weapon-wielder who both guides and threatens—creates genuine tension through embodied details like "fingers that knew the weight of shadows." The prophetic utterance emerging accidentally shows loss of control under pressure. Her final smile while "counting the hours until she'd climb again" demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost in her isolation from the village.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dye master's journey from borrowed heart to authentic rhythm shows clear motivation through concrete embodied details—the heart "thudded against his ribs, not in fear, but recognition." The transformation from passive recipient to active conduit of stories earns its cost through specific choices, though some interior passages edge toward abstraction ("hollows that ached to be filled").

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's character emerges through embodied actions—hands that patch walls with "whispered apologies," that don't tremble when dismantling grief. His understanding shifts from questioning what trees witness to knowing they absorb, a realization earned through handling the sextant's quantified sorrow. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the sheer pressure of it") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as memory keeper, with concrete embodied emotions (bleeding fingers, burning throat) driving her desperate attempt to revive the realm. The internal conflict between her terror and duty creates genuine tension, and her transformation from isolated keeper to part of a collective voice carries visible cost. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "mirror world's" greed and the slightly convenient arrival of other villagers.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena's internal contradiction between hiding and seeking is well-embodied through concrete actions (pressing palm to bookcase, fingers passing through the book). The final choice to lock the door for the first time carries earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around empathy ("phantom limbs") that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's "heuristically gentle" trait manifests through concrete actions (replanting flagstones, distributing bread) with visible cost—the guards' indifference, years of solitary noticing. The final hand-taking gesture with the prince crystallizes her character arc. Minor deduction for the prince's underdeveloped presence despite his emotional weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—measuring frequencies becomes a desperate extraction before dissolution. The vow recognition triggers genuine trembling and the final choice to step onto the bridge carries visible cost (library dissolving behind him). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("extraction: to conjure meaning") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation is crystal clear—hunting the man who killed her father—with embodied tension in how she clutches the watch fob "too tight." The moment of capturing "the sound of trust breaking" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, though the final renunciation could use slightly more visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's transformation from skeptic to embodiment of weather is well-motivated through concrete sensory details (taste of ozone, copper for longing) and her internal contradiction is embodied in action. The moment where "the compass had never once flickered for her" creates genuine surprise that earns the transformation, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("luminous skeptic") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation through grief and artistic suppression is deeply rooted, with contradictory impulses (duty to father's shop vs. artistic calling) acting simultaneously throughout. The final transformation from charcoal safety to explosive color is earned through accumulated pressure, though the epiphany borders on slightly too neat. Strong embodied emotion in "The first stroke was a scream. The second, a sob."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's physical reaction to dishonesty ("skin paled like parchment left in the sun, his joints stiffening") provides concrete embodied stakes, and his final choice to write honestly carries visible cost. The contradictory impulses between gilding truth and confronting honesty play out through action, particularly in his journey to the Archive and decision to leave unguilded words.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's seasonal muteness creates genuine constraint that shapes her artistic practice and communication methods.

The final choice to continue after the ice shatters shows earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias-7's internal conflict between preservation and necessary destruction drives a genuinely earned transformation, with the box of fears providing concrete embodiment of his contradictory impulses. The final choice to leave the dome carries visible cost through 127 years of accumulated identity. Minor deduction for the woman's backstory feeling slightly convenient as motivation catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's motivation to connect stories with healing is clear and embodied through concrete actions (handling the locket, opening the mailbox). The internal experience remains grounded in physical detail rather than abstract emotion. However, the final transformation to community healing happens too quickly without sufficient internal conflict or cost shown in Mira's choice to share Elena's letter.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's internal journey from decoder to embodiment of the scientist's philosophy lands with earned weight, particularly in the dance-as-cipher sequence where vulnerability becomes strength. The character's transformation feels inevitable yet costly—she gains understanding but loses the tangible evidence of her years of work. Minor deduction for some abstract moments ("vulnerability was a cipher waiting to be cracked") that could have been more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lantern lighter's grief-driven obsession reads with strong internal consistency, and his methodical ritual reveals character through action. The contradiction between his scientific approach and mystical belief creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract rendering of the wife's presence in the crystal chamber, which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The summoner's motivation to "map the silence" and counter the prophecy is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the origami wing and water ritual. Her years-long pursuit shows consistent drive, and the final acceptance of partial success ("Just a sigh") represents earned endurance with visible cost. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves linearly toward her goal without meaningful internal opposition pulling her elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority with Elias's physical responses to the building's language ("staggered," "fingers trembled"). The cyclical transformation from student to teacher shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for Veyra's somewhat stock mysterious-mentor characterization, though the "died once already" smile adds specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and rooted in familial loss, with her rebellion against memory erasure driving consistent choices. The internal contradiction between skepticism and belief ("You don't believe in ghosts, but you believe in me") creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("stubborn love") rather than fully embodied states, though the physical act of digging and pressing forehead to soil partially compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forger's internal contradiction between vengeance and forgiveness drives genuine complexity, with embodied details like trembling fingers and fogged breath. The Emperor's transformation from tyrant to student feels earned through the accumulated weight of seventeen years of forgery. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "forgiveness" declaration mid-story rather than letting it emerge purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—pressing the shell to her ear, tightening her grip during confrontation. The internal conflict between seeking answers and understanding their cost plays out in scene, particularly in her final choice to hurl the shell away. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "chasing echoes" before it crystallizes into concrete quest.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's contradictory impulses manifest beautifully in her simultaneous connection to and distance from the dead ("I did. I just kept the parts worth saving").

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("grief sharpening into something brighter") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's philosophy emerges through embodied action (net-mending, tea ritual, whistling) rather than declaration, with his final gesture of setting down the cup marking earned completion. Liora's transformation from skepticism to understanding is grounded in the concrete moment of witnessing the minnows respond, though her emotional arc could deepen beyond wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's skepticism and pattern-seeking drive clear choices throughout, with internal contradiction between disbelief and what he witnesses creating genuine tension. The final reach toward the "cure" shows earned transformation from debunker to believer, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("meaning" pushed back) rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's transformation from passive receiver to active prophet is earned through accumulated pressure and contradictory impulses ("He wasn't just the needle anymore. He was the hand").

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("assembled from scraps of older myths") that could be more embodied.

    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—trembling hands on the rusted key, eyes burning at the girl's laughter—with contradictory impulses (hoarding vs. sharing) acting simultaneously in scene. The renunciation of isolation for connection earns its cost through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward label-speak ("gleaned redemption").

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)

    Lior's motivation as a "horizon mapper" who practices patience as revolution is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through his physical interaction with the viaduct. The internal conflict between his patience and his sister's fury creates genuine tension. However, the epiphany about patience lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (father's teaching, the investigator role, urgency to preserve history), and his final choice to "dig" carries visible cost. Internal conflict between professional duty and moral imperative plays out in action. The "raw, jagged edge of breaking free" feels earned through prior pressure, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's internal journey from passive guilt to active atonement is well-earned through concrete details like the unsent letter kept for twelve years.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pip's "steadily curious" nature drives concrete choices throughout—testing new wings despite repeated crashes, prying free the arrow to use as compass, conducting rather than falling. The yearning algorithm as internal contradiction works well, though the final transformation ("conducting" the air) edges toward unearned epiphany without sufficient embodied struggle in that specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation to uncover her brother's erasure drives increasingly risky choices with clear internal conflict between duty and family loyalty. The final choice to let the algorithm take her shows earned transformation through specific pressures, though some emotional beats rely on abstraction ("the hum of the servers sounded like a heartbeat") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's characterization succeeds through concrete embodiment of his shadow-laced nature and the earned progression from passive peacekeeper to active intervener. The fragment's effect on him—showing rather than soothing—creates genuine internal conflict that drives his decisive choice to step onto the ice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the space where doubt lived") and occasional therapy-speak ("map empathy onto action").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior's transformation from seeking endings to choosing presence is earned through concrete details (parasol tip divining safe passage, the dog's recognition). Internal contradiction operates throughout ("the kind of laugh that belonged to someone who still expected good things"). Minor deduction for the grandmother's initials revelation feeling slightly convenient, though it works thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lior's internal contradiction between staying and understanding Mira's leaving creates genuine tension, embodied through physical interaction with the letter and wine. The final realization that "love, sometimes, was the quiet before the storm" earns its weight through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("destined mismatches" feels prompt-like).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)

Internal contradiction between preserving whispers and confronting the prophet's loud echoes drives authentic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation to transmute collective pain into art is embodied through concrete actions—collecting photographs, arranging them, taking the final shot. Her perceptive calm manifests in how she waits for light shifts and moves through the field "like a breath held too long." The closure choice to continue this work in other towns shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost ("her chest didn't ache" signals prior pain).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's obsession with the crystal and his shift from passive observation to active collaboration shows clear motivation with embodied tension ("fingers hovering," "breath shallow"). The woman's arrival forces a choice that forecloses his solitary path with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("adrift in a hush so profound it hummed") that could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—seeking yet unable to hold time—manifest through concrete actions with the chalk, tape, and driftwood. His final choice to leave the chalk behind carries earned weight from established patterns. Minor deduction for the "precognitively forgetful" trait remaining somewhat abstract despite affecting his compulsive behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between stillness and motion drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to sync with the spinning hand rather than stop it. The contradictory impulses of repair/release act simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "the *idea* of it" and occasional drift into elevated register during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied emotion through concrete details like the vinyl shard pressed to lips "for the way it bit" and Mrs. Calloway's knuckles white around the teacup. The protagonist's choice to play despite knowing futility, using music to "reunify" rather than distract, shows clear motivation rooted in her philosophy of "decisively kind." Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("hope shifted from a flame to a scent") rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in intellectual curiosity that intensifies into existential stakes. The automaton interaction and her decisive "Good, then I won't be alone" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, internal conflict could be more embodied during peak beats, and some moments edge toward diagnostic clarity ("she would chase the things that answered back").

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's characterization as a "forgiving skeptic" who "believed in lies more easily than truths, but never held them against anyone" creates a distinctive psychological profile that drives her measured response to the supernatural. Her bone-setting expertise meaningfully informs her approach to "setting the world," though the brother's transformation lacks sufficient emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to preserve and transmit non-burning light is grounded in specific loss (Elias, grandmother) and embodied through tactile gem-polishing. The girl's arrival creates genuine agency through Liora's choice to pass on knowledge, though the girl herself remains somewhat thin as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's characterization succeeds through embodied details—tracing icicle patterns, rolling moss between fingers—that reveal her processing trauma through tactile connection. The pendant exchange crystallizes her shift from needing protection to offering it, with visible cost in relinquishing her grandmother's gift. Minor deduction for Javier's slightly underdeveloped interior life.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's struggle between control and surrender drives genuine internal conflict, with the seashell fragment and mother's wisdom creating motivated tension. The dissolution into story lands as earned transformation, though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophizing ("monuments to his refusal to let hope be soft") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's internal conflict between storytelling and song-singing creates genuine tension, with embodied details like trembling fingers and the burning throat. The transformation from avoidance to acceptance earns its emotional weight through specific sensory work, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("stories were safer than songs, which demanded truth").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's motivation crystallizes through embodied patience—her curved spine, cracked fingers, and methodical layering reveal character through physical detail. The final choice to continue working "in the spaces between breaths" shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("patience as endless as the dark") that briefly pulls from concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars—his daughter's unanswered question about wonder propelling three years of echo-collecting. Internal contradiction plays effectively when "It wasn't about preservation. / It was about *access*" reframes his project mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira's contradictory impulses between holding on and letting go manifest viscerally through her interaction with the camera wheel and ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's functional creativity drives concrete choices throughout—jury-rigging the terminal's systems, repurposing rather than fixing, sketching solutions. Her internal contradiction between assigned duty and compulsive problem-solving creates genuine tension, particularly in "That was precisely why she'd come." The final renunciation of sleep for sketching shows earned character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scribe's internal contradiction between preserving silence and releasing his unfinished work drives a meaningful renunciation with visible cost. His choice to break the crystal and reassemble the orrery despite elder condemnation shows clear motivation rooted in the "petrichor nostalgia" that "unraveled something in him." The final image of him letting silence "measure him" rather than measuring it demonstrates earned transformation through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal contradiction between following and letting go plays out through concrete actions—steering toward marshes instead of profit, dropping the ledger while keeping the sundial. The final choice to walk away from gold is earned through accumulated realizations about lies as scaffolding, though some reflective passages edge toward abstraction ("the architecture of lies").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's patient, methodical character drives authentic choices throughout, with his decades of collecting seeds/stories establishing clear motivation for decoding the rope. The internal consistency holds as he moves from observation to active preservation, though the emotional stakes could intensify more viscerally at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through absences drives concrete actions—following the thread, finding the locket, interpreting the prince's departure. Internal contradictions emerge when he realizes he writes obituaries not for loss but for finding, crystallizing in his decision to board the next ship as a "cartographer of the spaces between." The cost of understanding absence manifests in his physical burning sensation from the thread and his commitment to carry others' absences "like seeds."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aldric's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (trembling fingers, pressing ear to egg), with internal conflict between desperate hope and "quaking certainty" of failure.

Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bitter-sweet ache of living") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's contradictory identity as "arsonist's daughter turned firefighter" drives genuine internal complexity, with her compassion toward her father creating authentic tension rather than simple rejection. The boy's wound provides immediate external pressure that tests her values, and her choice to heal with the same thread that holds her father's coin demonstrates layered motivation. Minor deduction for the village's whispered judgment remaining abstract rather than embodied in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora's skepticism drives genuine internal conflict between her disbelief in patience and her compulsion to act, with embodied tension ("fingers traced," "hands didn't waver").

Minor deduction for the younger-self voice appearing without sufficient setup, though the contradiction works thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra's internal conflict between accepting cycles and breaking patterns drives genuine agency through the memory sacrifice, with embodied tension in "breath hitched" and bones that "vibrated."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carver's internal conflict between craft and grief manifests through embodied contradiction—his twitching fingers, the chisel slip that voices his suppressed scream.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation crystalizes through the carved names and his relationship to village silence, with contradictory impulses (duty vs. truth-telling) acting in scene. The final choice to continue carving while knowing the consequences shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("Absolution...wasn't a single grand gesture") that borders on thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation builds through concrete embodied details—his warm fingers from soil, his tilted head at the breathing tapestry—and his final choice to reset the chess pieces carries visible cost in accepting the widow's true burden. The contradictory impulses (shouldn't be playing chess/compelled to untangle) act simultaneously in scene, though the widow remains more functional than fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's characterization as an "ignorance cartographer" who maps possibility rather than prophecy shows clear, consistent motivation throughout. Her internal tension between forcing versus coaxing the future manifests in concrete hesitation before the first stroke and relief when the spire accepts her work. The final choice to plant questions rather than commands demonstrates earned wisdom with visible cost—she relinquishes control for collaborative creation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to restore voice to the silenced city is clear and consistent, with embodied tension in his hunched posture and the physical risk of execution. The arrival of Lira crystallizes his purpose through her transcribed lyrics—proof his broadcasts are working. His choice to include her despite danger shows genuine cost, though the disappearance ending feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation through artistic philosophy and the mask's personal history (mother's teacup) create strong character particularity. The internal consistency around art-as-dissolution philosophy drives credible choices. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her emotional state—we understand her intellectually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve truth against erasure is viscerally rooted in his mother's death during the council's deliberations. His final choice to stand in the tunnel's mouth with the cog—knowing he'll drown—demonstrates contradictory impulses (preservation vs. witness) acting simultaneously with visible cost. The "reaching" gesture at closure crystallizes his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation through loss is deeply embodied ("expectantly resigned sigh," "scribbling not melodies but silences"). The four remaining choir members have distinct physical markers and arrive with earned wariness. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of their simultaneous arrival, but the final choice to join the negative-space humming carries genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation is grounded in his synesthetic gift and professional trauma, with embodied emotion ("weight of the city's expectations couldn't press against his ribs"). The transformation from isolation to communal feeding is earned through concrete discovery and experimentation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gardener of moments") that verges on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's truth-telling affliction creates genuine internal tension, particularly when he admits "You're afraid it won't work." The choice to plant the seed represents a meaningful stance crystallization with visible cost (giving up his father's legacy), though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and grounded in her obsession with understanding "the hush" beneath surfaces, driving her ritualistic arrangement at the water's edge. Her internal shift from seeking to understanding ("Some houses felt alive because they had learned to listen. And so, at last, had she") feels earned through the scene's accumulation, though the epiphany arrives somewhat cleanly for the mystical territory explored.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's telepathic intrusions create genuine pressure that forces the human's worldview to crack, with contradictory impulses (mission vs. emerging truth) acting simultaneously in scene. The human's transformation from assassin to participant feels earned through specific revelations, though the final helmet removal could use more embodied struggle to fully sell the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's contradictory impulses—capturing without reclaiming, climbing without believing in endings—act simultaneously throughout. Her final choice to continue climbing "because she wanted to" shows earned transformation with visible cost (leaving the smooth die behind). The "grim optimist" characterization manifests through concrete actions rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's forty-three nights of sleeplessness creates a compelling embodied state that drives his methodical hope through concrete action. His motivation crystallizes through the memory of the calligrapher's gift and her words about "when words won't come in your own tongue," earning the final choice to continue despite exhaustion. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around kindness that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to preserve dying arts drives credible choices through the lens discovery and bread-baking scenes, with embodied tension when her hands shake lifting the lens. The transformation from passive museum guide to active preserver feels earned through concrete discoveries, though some emotional transitions (particularly the sudden understanding of absorption) could use more granular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's obsession drives credible action with embodied detail ("fingers stained with oil and intent"), and his final choice to step into the hunger stones carries visible cost. The "laugh clawed its way up his throat, raw and bleak and exhilarated" effectively embodies contradictory impulses at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lysander's motivation to confront his photographically cursed existence is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly the decisive act of pulling the filmstrip from his doppelganger. The internal contradiction between wanting to trick fear while embodying it himself creates genuine tension. However, the whispering advisor's role remains underdeveloped as exposition rather than dramatized pressure, and some emotional beats rely on abstract phrasing ("repulsive allure") rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leeward's motivation to "dub" the storm by turning resistance into rhythm is clear and distinctive. His internal experience layers effectively through embodied sensation ("restlessness in his bones," "mallet trembled in his grip").

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elyas's motivation emerges clearly through concrete actions—tracing grooves, decoding patterns, blowing the whistle—with his "gnawing certainty" that the watchers wait for him providing internal tension. The character's decade-long obsession feels earned through specific details like "patterns in their silence," though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("asking itself became the destination").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his decade-long pursuit of truth, with concrete embodied tension in his pulse betraying his "emotionally rational" demeanor. The choice to photograph rather than flee shows values hierarchy under pressure. Minor deduction for Callahan's somewhat stock righteousness and the slightly convenient "they know you have it" message timing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to preserve hidden stories drives consistent action through the pavilion exploration and note exchange, with his "stoically sensitive" nature embodied in precise surveying paired with poetic grief. The final choice to continue as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" shows earned commitment with visible cost (his wife left him for this obsession). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the ache in it") rather than fully embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's motivation to trace "honest origins" and uncover historical erasures drives credible choices throughout, with his methodical nature embodied in careful hands and steady pulse. The discovery of his own name creates genuine contradiction between his pursuit of truth and confronting personal stakes. However, the resolution—choosing to keep working while hiding the discovery—lacks the visible emotional cost needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lantern maker's grief-driven transformation reads with embodied specificity—trembling fingers, the gem that "pulled at her skin, hungry."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation through grief-driven obsession with "hunting potential" is clear and embodied through concrete actions like stealing morgue footage and manipulating the observatory equipment. The geode as "unused time" creates a specific, non-generic driver. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract notion of "perturbation" in peak moments that could use more embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's characterization succeeds through concrete details ("sharp eyes catching the faintest tremor") and embodied loneliness ("the frequency of belonging"). The pilgrim remains underdeveloped as a functional prop. The final connection feels slightly unearned given minimal prior interaction between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's guilt manifests through embodied contradictions—the cold brass cuff against the watch hand he "wasn't supposed to keep," his measured exhales against client grief while carrying seven years of self-deception. The final choice to meet Harkin despite knowing the danger shows earned agency with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("the weight of a withheld truth had finally tipped the scales").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied characterization with Elias's drawer pull habit revealing internal pressure and Kaelis's hesitation undercutting her ruthless reputation. The boy's raw wrists and whispered question about forgiveness create genuine vulnerability. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("a way to untether your nephew from a war he didn't start") that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in paternal regret, with embodied details like the compass "digging into his ribs." The internal conflict between leaving and staying plays out through concrete micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liam's internal contradiction between wanting empathy and fearing it creates genuine tension, embodied through concrete details like flexing fingers and the hollow behind his ribs. The final chess game choice lands with earned causality, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("Empathy isn't something you get... It's something you give") rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's grief-driven attempt to resurrect her brother shows clear motivation with embodied emotion ("fingers twitched," "sank to her knees"). The transformation from resisting to accepting her role as "the bridge" demonstrates earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("too porous, too willing to bleed for love") in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation to find her vanished brother drives concrete choices with embodied tension ("fingers trembled," "throat tightened"). The final renunciation of hoarded grief shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "willingly perplexed" trait that lacks fuller dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lien's motivation to mend the dimensional tear is clear and consistent, driven by three hundred years of solitary purpose. Her embodied responses—body becoming "lighter" with grief lifting, trembling fingers at breakthrough—ground the emotional arc. The final choice to step through carries genuine cost (unraveling behind her), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the pivotal push.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira's motivation as a "philanthropist with empty pockets" who trades light for fire is embodied through concrete actions—distributing vials, throwing them into lava, accepting transformation. The character arc from giving light to embracing fire transformation is earned, though some transitions ("of course she would fulfill it by accident") feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael's motivation is grounded in specific ledgers of atrocities, and his methodical competence drives choices with clear stakes. However, we never see him struggle with internal contradiction or face genuine difficulty - his picks always work perfectly, undermining complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's curse of "always knowing the moment before something shifted" creates genuine internal tension that drives her compulsive pattern-making.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal conflict between censorship and expression drives authentic choices throughout, with embodied details like "ink-stained fingers" and the physical act of tearing the poem.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Characters show genuine internal contradiction (Elias's mechanical precision vs philosophical flexibility, Liora's calculated smirk vs genuine eagerness), and the final partnership choice carries visible cost—they abandon the Council verdict they waited three days for. The "fierce minds could fence with shadows and still walk away partners" lands with earned weight. Slight deduction for the convenience of Liora's twelve-year-old code being exactly what's needed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias's internal contradiction between the "itch" to leave and his attachment to the library creates genuine tension, culminating in his choice to stay (tucking the violet into Maren's palm). The molting identity trait functions beyond label, constraining his sense of permanence. However, Maren lacks dimensional complexity beyond her role as keeper of books.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena's motivation is grounded in concrete loss and ritualized hope (winding the broken clock daily), with her "strategically creative" approach to fate showing agency under constraint. The final choice to play "not for the past, but for the encore" demonstrates earned change through accumulated pressure, though the lover's characterization remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's internal conflict between duty and self-preservation drives a credible final choice with visible cost ("her teeth stained violet"). The contradiction between knowing the seed will erase her mind yet choosing it anyway creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract treatment of villagers' forgetting, which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's internal journey from rigid grief to acceptance flows through embodied details like his "calloused hands cradling a bonsai pot" and the physical act of pressing "his palm to the wet sand." The transformation from seeing the horizon as "a wound" to "just the place where the sky remembered the water" demonstrates earned change through concrete action rather than epiphany.

His final choice to become a keeper is earned by the jade's revelation, with visible cost in his transformed shadow.

    Liora's motivation to "unbuild" is clear and rooted in her profession and personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lien's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief and duty, compelling high-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is embodied in tactile, specific actions (e.g., "her body hummed, lighter than it should have been"). The final choice to step through is earned by three hundred years of prior causality, with the cost of her unravelling felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in a desire to give light. Her final choice is earned, though the line "her destitution suddenly irrelevant" feels slightly summary-like, a minor deduction from a peak emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and rooted in the ledgers he has read, compelling his high-stakes choice. His interiority is concrete and particular, shown through embodied actions like his steady hands and the worn quill holder. The final choice to spark the revolution is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of the fort's coming destruction felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's characterization is deeply integrated with her precognitive curse and role as eel herder. Her actions under pressure—tracing patterns, placing rocks, harnessing the dust—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, as her choice to push with burning hands forecloses an easy path. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing ("knew: the promise had never been to her") in peak beat, but embodied emotion dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion and clear, escalating motivation rooted in his silenced past. His final choice to let the poem go is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality, with the cost visible in his lighter descent. Internal conflict is shown in scene, not summarized, particularly in the line wondering if his scars were "roads or warnings."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characters are vividly realized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—Elias's precision versus his sharp tongue, Liora's calculated smirk versus her eagerness. Their final partnership is earned through prior causality, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The mechanical arm and diplomatic fierceness are embodied traits that alter tactics. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through specific, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's contradictory impulses—restlessness versus commitment—are embodied in micro-choices like the lie about leaving. His final choice to stay is earned by the tactile connection with Maren and the charged reconfiguration of the library's purpose. The cost of enduring the "itch" is felt, and his internal conflict is specific, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices like winding the clock daily and her "steely longing" revealing a hierarchy of values. Her strategic creativity is shown, not told, through her manipulation of the film and compasses. The final renunciation of her old waiting is earned by her on-page agency, with the cost felt in her steady voice and the reconfigured space.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's characterization is rich with contradictory impulses—fear versus duty, individual versus collective—that culminate in her earned, costly choice to eat the seed. Her internal conflict is embodied and particular, not alternating summaries. The final renunciation is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority—his neutron‑star lens refracts grief into disciplined attention—and micro‑choices (sprinkling dust, refusing to replant, sending the sabbatical email) align with that worldview. Contradictory impulses (scientist/performer vs. witness of decay) are present and resolved through renunciation with felt cost. Embodiment lands early (gloved fingers, damp soil) though later insights edge toward abstraction. The final renunciation is credibly earned by prior beats rather than bestowed as epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and character-specific, filtered through glasswork and frost with embodied emotion (“her fingers tracing the brittle patterns like forgotten script”). The brother’s handwriting revelation creates a credible internal rupture that reorients her. Contradictory impulses—attachment to the ledger vs. instinct to read the world directly—coexist and resolve in a motivated renunciation. A few thesis-like lines edge toward abstraction, but the choices remain earned.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied motivation (rectify the stolen sound) and tactile interiority (“listened…with the scars on her hands”) make Liora particular and credible. Contradictory impulses—grief versus resolve—coexist on the page and drive her choices. Her bleeding, and the decision to reenter the storm, register as a felt cost. Slight idealization of competence at peak beats trims the ceiling but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s quiet, duty-bound stubbornness motivates every choice, from keeping the ledger to hauling the lens and risking the climb. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“salt and sorrow,” “ledger dry”) and his micro-choices under pressure feel inevitable. The renunciation—adding his own name—reads as an earned endurance with a felt cost. A touch more on the fear or doubt at the top would deepen the internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives—refusing hunger as legacy, choosing anonymity, then risking visibility—are clear and expressed through concrete acts, not labels. His reluctance versus leadership, secrecy versus open defiance, give him credible contradiction. Interiority is enacted rather than told (e.g., tucking Liora’s note into the bell), which keeps him particular. A touch more embodied stress at the public ringing could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, specific motive (to locate “where the unused love goes”) and embodied interiority (“breath form shapes—first a serpent, then a key”). The apparition catalyzes a credible turn, though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressurized. Final acceptance of the keeper role reads earned, with the jade’s burn/disappearance as cost. Slight softness: minimal friction or competing impulse beyond awe.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s goal (unbuild the maze; find the texture) is clear and intensifies under pressure, and her choices drive the major turns (pressing the halo into soil; lateral escape; discarding the fragment). Contradictory impulses—curiosity versus survival—surface in the photograph corridor and in her final renunciation. Embodied perception (“grain of time” under her palm; ozone and lavender) roots emotion in concrete detail. Slightly emblematic moments (“design the edges”) flirt with thesis, but remain earned by action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motive—liberate and disperse seeds at the wall’s fall—drives concrete, high‑pressure choices (decoding, reverse‑keying, piano trap, scattering seeds). Interiority is economical but specific; “Patiently strategic” threads backstory to present tactics. The hesitation at the vault and refusal to run from the guard add lived texture, though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched. The earned endurance/cost is clear: risk, exposure, and emptying her pockets.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motives are precise and embodied: he hunts “absences” to understand the sound of trust breaking, and his micro-choices (lighting the forge, selecting the sister’s imprint, extinguishing the fire bare‑handed) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction—clinical precision by day versus messy, synesthetic listening by night—animates the scene. The scars and willingness to wade into the rising tide register a cost that fits his arc. A touch of thesis‑statement clarity (“Trust didn’t break like glass”) slightly reduces ambiguity but remains earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s obsession (“she collected illuminated moments”) cleanly motivates her tactics (decoding flowers, choosing to shatter the mirror with moonlight). Agency is strong in the key turns, especially her deliberate choice to miss the last train and to throw the jar. Interiority is vivid if slightly declarative in a few lines (“She’d never wanted the dark”), and internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized. Still, the pressure reveals character through choice rather than label.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motives (revive/repurpose her father’s “sanctuary” versus fear of collapse) are clear and tested by concrete micro‑choices: reading the logbook, accepting “controlled collapse,” and turning the final valve. Interiority is embodied through glassmaking habits and frost/heat sensitivities, not labels. The renunciation—leaving without watching the outcome—carries a felt cost and aligns with her character logic. A touch more on her blind spots under stress could have deepened the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, pressurized interiority with grounded contradictions: a stunt pro terrified of water who still chooses to bleed on the shell and climb for the ledger. Micro-choices (pocketing the shell, decoding the cast, pressing blood) align with motive and escalate. The relationship with the girl adds pressure and subtext without diluting POV. Slight neatness in the final resolve keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eldrin’s motive—mapping the night through collected silences—is clear and particular, and his micro‑choices (pressing the wall, retelling, surrendering the booklet) align with it. The interiority feels embodied via tactile actions (gold leaf smudging, cold breath) rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (obsession with recording versus the renunciation of the record), landing at the end. Slight limitation: conflict remains largely conceptual, reducing lived friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, coherent interior drive—curiosity and self‑inquiry—grounds every choice, with the composed affect sharpening X‑7’s specificity. The violin interactions reveal character under pressure without melodrama. Contradictory impulses are muted (curiosity vs. composure rather than a sharper clash), keeping the emotional band a touch narrow. The culminating act—playing a name—reads earned by prior perception shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives—mistrust transformed into a practice of nonverbal honesty—are concrete and enacted through micro‑choices (drawing, sliding the ticket, continuing the practice). Her interior contradiction (skeptical of words yet hungry to connect) is dramatized rather than told. The shift from “cryptic” to “clear” doodles reads earned. Cost is subtle—the relinquishing of guardedness—but legible in her altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: she loves the garden and chooses demonstration over argument, revealing character under pressure. The admission “It was a mended deception” lends flaw and complexity without neat absolution. Micro‑choices (polishing, building the shrine, leading the elders to the center) show a hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; the emotional cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s obsession to prove time “spills sideways” motivates every move, and the refusal to pull again at the end reads as an earned stasis with cost. Interiority is specific (“mechanically warm” hands; noticing clocks slow when specimens dream), and his competence is credible without making him infallible. The AI offers minimal relational pressure but sharpens his defiance. A clearer flicker of doubt or competing value in the middle could deepen the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (to disrupt the stillness and decode the ghost’s signals) are clear and embodied through tactile choices—wading, prying up the board with his bow, choosing to wait and then play one sustained note. Interiority is specific and character‑bound (musician’s perception of silence, water, pitch). Internal tension between impulse to disrupt and the learned patience to “play the silence” gives credible movement. The cost is subtle but present in the prolonged vigil and in leaving without looking back.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradictions are vivid: “fault‑tolerant oracle” who trembles at the barometer and lives in the margins. Her ambivalence about warning versus silence feels rooted in character, not plot convenience. The final renunciation (stepping into the storm) is earned by the accumulated tactile tells (ozone, blood, ravens, hygrometer). A minor opacity remains around why she withholds the radio warning beyond theme, shaving some force from motive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motives (skeptical scavenger compelled by his father’s confession) are clear and consistent, tightening into the choice to turn the valve and then to carry the wheel. Interiority is specific and embodied (the “too heavy for its size” appraisal; breath going shallow). Contradictory impulses—reflex skepticism vs. felt pressure—coexist on the page. The Earned Stasis at the end (not running; accepting the burden) feels credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive—“to witness change without judgment”—is embodied through concrete micro-choices (pressing the swan, entering the refuge, not reading). The Earned Stasis of self‑erasure is credible and carries cost (“their edges blurring”). Internal contradiction is muted (acceptance over conflict), but the renunciation of name and personhood credibly forecloses alternatives. Interiority is particular and embodied rather than labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s patience, professional acuity, and reverence for sound drive motivated choices (canceling sessions, selecting the ridge, handing off the vial, choosing the specific song). Interiority is concrete and embodied (watching Mira’s feet, reading Lila’s hands). The relationship pressure with Lila/Mira culminates in Lila surrendering the keepsake—an earned, character‑revealing cost. Minor softness: Elias is idealized with limited visible flaw or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s motives are crystal—he collects the stories walls have heard—and his micro-choices (handling the tapestry, coaxing embers, accepting the tug, leaving the silo) align. Interiority is embodied and particular (“fingers tracing the stitches,” “rusted hinge” breath), with no diagnostic labeling. The renunciation at the end (walking away, diaries turned to ash) reads as an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; he doesn’t resist the pull, so tension remains more elegiac than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Chen’s motives and methods are coherent: he’s not a spy but an orchestrator who uses fortunes and intermediaries to move dangerous information. The key choices—handing off the microdot and abandoning the lighthouse—align with his worldview and cost him identity and stewardship. Interiority is vivid but more conceptual than bodily; we get less visceral stress under imminent threat. Still, the contradictory stance (“not a spy” yet directing a spycraft handoff) credibly energizes his final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (illumination over exorcism) drives concrete choices—the pedal, the indigo, stepping into the rising symbols—and exacts a cost (erasure into the anchor’s logic). Interiority is conveyed mostly through action and diction rather than embodied sensation, keeping us at a lyric remove. The tension with the entity creates a credible crucible, but micro‑contradictions and bodily stakes are under-detailed. Still, the sacrifice reads earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Li Wei’s motivations and contradictions are particular and embodied: duty to the city versus the ache of “when,” the courier’s knock versus the pull of the ice’s “first, true note.” Micro‑choices (pressing harder with the brush, stepping onto the balcony, letting the courier wait) reveal values. The shift from writing to “conducting” is earned by long‑seeded traits. The cost is subtle (renouncing immediate obligation and identity) but present.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Crisp interior drive (“conquest…of the self”) and embodied perception (“gravity itself hesitated around him”) give specificity, and the merge with the shadow‑self externalizes the inner split. Micro‑choices (tracing the rune, not resisting the sideways rewind, lunging at the double) align with motive under pressure. A slight tendency to declare insight (“It was conquest”) trims mystery but doesn’t flatten the arc. The final renunciation—the tablet’s loss and acceptance of gravity—reads earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—recovering a way to teach and feel music despite deafness—is concrete and accrues through tactile perception and the charged keepsake of the broken needle. The internal contradiction (carrying loss as a talisman vs. choosing to re‑enter music via vibration) plays on the page. Micro‑choices—placing the needle down, pressing his palm to the horn, accepting the wrapped needle—reveal values without sermonizing. Change is earned and forecloses the old “proper scales” path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictions are alive on the page: disciplined observer vs. credibly curious meddler (he opens the tube, hides contraband, yet vows not to interfere). Embodied perception (“pigeons… like pages left open in the rain”) grounds his mind under pressure. The micro‑choices—refusing to turn, untying “laterally,” deciding to “record the silence”—track a hierarchy of values. The closing stance costs him safety and anonymity, felt in “not his” door and the admission he’s not sure he wants to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motives are precise and embodied: his aromatically cautious nature collides with the aching need to unseal the vial. Contradictory impulses—aversion to scent as a trigger vs. compulsion to know—play out in scene. His renunciation (recorking, smashing lanterns, selling the vial, leaving) feels earned and costly. The interiority is character‑specific, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    A singular, embodied interiority anchors the poet—his ethically playful streak, tactile obsessions, and ambivalence toward escape cohere into credible micro-choices (unwinding, swinging, then carving). The internal contradiction—yearning for freedom vs. suspicion of its illusion—operates in scene. The cost registers (burned hands, relinquishing the rope’s prior uses), though the personal stakes skew more conceptual than visceral. Relationship pressure is light since the beings function as responsive atmosphere rather than active antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s motives—honoring family, tending the “unfinished,” deciding whether to carry the music forward—are clear and embodied through small, specific actions. Her micro‑choices (shifting from her father’s melody to something new; inviting the child in; filling the bowl) reveal value hierarchy under gentle pressure. Interiority is lyric yet concrete; the relationship with the child reorients her stance credibly. The internal conflict is subtle rather than jagged, which slightly limits intensity at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives—professional rigor versus the client’s desire for a painless simulacrum—are clear and culminate in a costly choice to take the ache into herself. Interiority is specific (the cuffs, the static, the “almost laughed”) and embodied. The chemist’s cowardice/tenderness reads credibly through sensory cues rather than labels. A hint more on Liora’s personal risk beyond momentary ache could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (profit-calculus softened by inherited compassion) are clear and dramatized through concrete micro-choices: the note, the locket handover, the partnership proposition. His internal contradiction—broker’s pragmatism versus unmonetized care—surfaces credibly in “ledger balanced a little less neatly.” The librarian is distinct but less interior; still, her guardedness and precise kindness read through action. The final choice feels earned with a modest but felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Reed’s motive (to complete the arbor and catalyze belonging) is clear and her actions align, especially the choice to organize the search against elders’ caution. Interiority is embodied through tactile, craft‑specific perceptions (reeds, obsidian, paint). Internal contradiction is modest; risk and doubt could surface more viscerally at the decision point. The visible cost is social vulnerability rather than a sharp loss, but it reads credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elspeth’s motive (find the echo, protect the moths/city) is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (rejecting the boy’s moth; throwing the jar; pulling the thread). Interiority is specific to her illustrator’s eye, avoiding generic feeling labels. A felt cost lands via the boy’s unraveling, though her internal contradiction under peak pressure could be pushed further. Relationship dynamics with the boy carry pressure without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is precise and embodied—he wants to “map grief” and chooses asking over resurrecting, then renounces resolution with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. acceptance; reach for the mist vs. let it go) play out on the page. Micro‑choices—placing the eyes, whispering an incantation to ask, reaching, then pocketing the eyes—reveal hierarchy of values. A slight neatness in the final realization (“some equations weren’t meant to balance”) trims a touch of messiness from an otherwise complex interior.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives—compulsive caretaking versus strict secrecy—are clear and pressure his micro-choices (dangling the tape, then stepping into light). Interiority is concrete and filtered through tactile habits (pipe chases, caches). The rule-breaking reads earned by the outage’s jolt and his long observation of the woman. Cost is present (forsaking invisibility and rules), if still more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s controlling impulse versus her curiosity is embodied in tactile micro‑choices—the microscope scene, the apology to roots, and the act of pulling stakes. The emotional turn from recording to surrender reads earned by prior behaviors. Felt cost is present: relinquishing professional habits and customer expectations. Minor safety in certainty around the epiphany keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—an insomniac painter aching to make meaning after the water wars—is embodied in concrete choices (following the rain, inserting the brooch, accepting “the threshing,” painting a new subject). Interiority is specific and character‑particular (“curiosity was the only currency left…”; “the sky itself were too exhausted to weep straight”). The contradiction between wry skepticism and earnest hunger drives his risk. The closing commitment (“got to work… more cracks to follow”) reads as an earned stance shift with a quiet cost of surrender to the island’s call.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Liora’s motives and flaw (control via foresight) are clear, and her micro-choices—touching the pearl, asking “Show me,” and leaving it—track. The interior turn lands, but the epiphany arrives with minimal resistance, making the change feel slightly unearned. Embodied detail (cool stone, trembling fingers) anchors emotion credibly. The lack of a tougher internal contradiction under pressure lowers the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to compile the city’s scattered silences into meaning—is specific and embodied, and the renunciation at the end (tossing the valve) reads as an earned choice. Interiority is vivid (“pressed it to his lips—not to blow, but to listen”), with tactile emotion over abstraction. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than robust; tension could sharpen around his reluctance to become a new herald. Still, actions align and reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s precision-as-defense is dramatized through tactile choices (compass, punch, hour) and culminates in a costly renunciation—turning away from the platform. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“belief that precision could outrun grief”). The choice to leave his sister is motivated, not tidy, with a credible ache. Slightly idealized self-articulation trims the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s skepticism and longing collide on the page—she “scoff[s] at magic” yet chooses to transcribe, press her palm to the tile, and finally let it go. Embodied cues (ink‑stained fingers, breath hitching, the tile’s warming pulse) keep emotions lived rather than labeled. The final renunciation (“She didn’t need the tile anymore”) is earned by prior micro‑choices and carries a felt cost. A hint more friction or error under pressure would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (ancient boredom and curiosity) and a credible renunciation (“let go”); interiority is specific to an immortal’s perspective. The emotional cost is conceptual rather than visceral, and internal contradiction is mild—he rarely hesitates. Micro‑choices (pressing the fragment, then dropping it) track to motive. Strong but not maximally conflicted characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motive—to invert her father’s predation and save the twelve—drives every choice, and her math-as-morality conflict is embodied in tactile actions (dipping the nib, recruiting the girl). The status dynamic with the girl is sharp and pressurized without sentimentality. The shift from “me” to “them” feels earned by the scene’s events. A slight tilt toward aphorism near the end trims some rawness from the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is vivid and character-specific—he collects “textures” instead of truth—and his micro-choices (listening, transcribing, beginning a new tree) align. The interiority is embodied through tactile actions (ear to glass, pen nib scraping). Internal contradiction is light; the cost is mostly implied (isolation, renunciation of the town’s waking world). Earned Stasis at the end reads credible if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Daniel’s interiority is particular and embodied through tactile noticing and ritualized choices (offerings, tearing the ledger page, sealing the bundle). Motivation—erasure begets collecting—stays coherent and deepens to a relinquishment. Internal conflict is present but understated; he rarely wavers on a goal, so contradictions are more tonal than tactical. The final act reads as an earned renunciation with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictions are vivid and motivating: a “myth buster” who still prays for miracles and chooses to play instead of chase dissolving pages. His micro‑choices under pressure—pressing the shell to strings, refusing to catch the last page, writing on skin—reveal values with cost. Interiority is specific and embodied; the “gloomy cheerfulness” reads through action rather than labels. The turn to myth keeper feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses (order vs. Lumina’s chaos) are dramatized through concrete choices: encoding resistance in art and pressing the foundation chip into the mural. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“recalibrated her breathing,” the chip “burned like a guilty secret”). Her choices align with motives and reveal values under pressure. A few thesis-like lines (“She wasn’t just fighting gentrification…”) flatten the otherwise sharp interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular motive—bear witness and “outlast” via images—drives every choice, with tactile interiority (the hourglass grain, the breath on the visor). The internal conflict is quiet rather than oppositional; he’s resolute, which trims complexity. Micro-choices (timed canister, when to shoot, not looking back) reveal values with a felt cost. Strong, if a touch low on contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s competence and humility are vivid, and his sensory substitutions create embodied motive. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he identifies, decides, and executes with little friction. The “savant before the accident” line adds texture without complicating present stakes. The quiet renunciation (anonymity, returning to work) reads, but the cost is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motive (pattern‑seeking editor drawn by the falcon/page) is clear and coherently embodied in her calm, exacting actions. The interiority is specific (condensation as cartography) and her composed curiosity under uncanny pressure reads as a credible flaw/strength. Contradictory impulses are understated but present—skeptical editor vs. fated “herald.” The final choice (offering the page, stepping forward) is earned and forecloses safety with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive and embodied choices (temple press, well strike, refusal to turn at “You’re late”) reveal a steady, craftsman ethos under pressure. The felt cost—lifelong maintenance—lands. However, internal contradiction is minimal; patience is asserted and enacted without much competing impulse, limiting depth. A touch more friction would elevate the character beyond icon to person.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive—to “harness the ephemeral” to rewrite guilt—is clear and intensifies under pressure, and her contradictory impulses (flee vs. stay, breathe vs. hush) are dramatized on the page. Embodied emotions are specific (salt, violets, silt, pressure), avoiding label-speak. The Earned Stasis at the end (refusing the call, selling the gear) forecloses a path with a felt cost. Minor note: Elias’s final image risks softening the conflict, but it reads as consequence rather than easy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—rewriting his father’s fate—drives concrete choices (installing the lattice, taking the name, fleeing). Interiority is specific and embodied (chasing “hush,” copperlight, salt‑thick voices). Contradictory impulses are present but muted; he rarely doubts, which slightly reduces dynamic tension. The final renunciation (telling the truth as “Nothing”) is earned and character‑specific, with a subtle cost in danger and complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motive—repaying a lifetimes‑old debt by waking Vesper—is clear and drives each beat; her actions align with that purpose. Interiority is lyric rather than analytic but embodied through image (ashen‑veil, silver nightshade) and cost. The keeper’s brief pressure reads specific and credible. Internal contradiction is light; the piece prioritizes devotion over conflict but pays visible cost in Liora’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (calloused hands, rasping voice) and his micro‑choices under pressure—pressing the plate at forks, touching the Heart Chamber, deciding to walk awake—align with a coherent trait set. Motivation accrues through ruin→repair instincts rather than exposition. Contradictory impulses (sleep’s surrender vs. chosen wakefulness) surface credibly without therapy‑speak. The cost is felt but modest (ache, relinquishing the cradle of sleepwalking) which keeps this short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—restore what roots can salvage—reads clear, embodied, and consistent, and his choices (excavating, planting, committing to go deeper) align under pressure. Interiority is textured through tactile focus and scent rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is mild (skepticism vs. reverent action), limiting depth of conflict. The solitary frame avoids relationship crucibles that might have sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is particular and embodied—the chalk grit, the clipboard’s weight, the hesitation at the mailbox—and her micro‑choices (tweaking etymologies, deciding to send, erasing the chalk) align with her values. The contradiction between control and letting go registers in the “moment before the letter left her hands.” Stakes are modest but credible for this scale. No relationship pressure is present, but the solitary crucible works.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s motive—to defend the integrity of the stars/stories—is clear and consistent, and his refusal to run credibly forecloses a path with cost. The small tells (off‑key humming, deliberate errors) individualize him. Internal contradiction is limited; he’s more steadfast than conflicted, which narrows complexity at peak pressure. The courier dynamic applies immediate pressure but doesn’t force a relational turn.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives are clear and pressurized: she longs for the charged poise before a decision and must confront whether to speak or relinquish. Embodied interiority (the shard’s sting, breath on water) grounds her contradictions—craving repair while courting erasure. The final choice (letting the letter go) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor softness: the moon‑healing motif slightly cushions the struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interiority is specific and embodied—ribs humming, translator’s instinct mapping fear—and her micro-choices (condensation tracing, interpreting the photo, giving away the coral) reveal values under pressure. The “shrewdly innocent” lens grounds how she hears the unsaid without sliding into diagnosis. The cost is quiet but legible: she accepts the burden of others’ pain, gives up her talisman, and steps toward more hurt. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s motive—using light to recover lost joy—is clear and consistent, and her choices (pressing the fragment to film, staging the public display) align with it. Interiority is vivid through sensory noticing and craft‑driven micro‑choices. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page hesitation under pressure; she rarely struggles against a counter‑urge. The cost is felt more conceptually than emotionally internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s motive—fleeing the suffocation of preservation for creation/curiosity—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (pressing the nickel, touching the painted nickel, painting a door, stepping through). Interiority is specific and embodied via tactile craft details and sound. Contradictory impulses (safety of certainty vs pull of the threshold) co-exist until she forecloses certainty by leaving. Minor shortfall: her “methodically playful” trait rarely imposes cost beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive (protecting outlaw thinking) is clear and enacted through specific, embodied choices (splitting the gourd, planting patterns, plucking the dandelion, pocketing the last seed). Interiority is textured but light; he rarely conflicts with himself, reading more assured than pressured. Relationship dynamics are sketched (librarian, botanist, teen) but not leveraged as crucibles. The closing stance (“now”) feels earned though the on‑page personal cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation—to alchemize pain into beauty—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (pressing the ghost, ensconcing the postcard, singing louder, writing/eating/sending the manual). Interiority is embodied and specific (ink‑veined hands, salt/metal taste). The “shyly unstoppable” contradiction reads on the page in persistent, unshowy action. Cost is legible: centuries of wakefulness and continued expenditure of self against new drums of war.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive—curating and preserving extinct sounds—drives both the inciting repair and the decisive destruction, with embodied tension when the name unfurls and she recoils. The contradiction between caretaker impulse and necessary renunciation lands credibly at the break. Interiority stays concrete (orchids, breath, ink) rather than abstract labels. Minor note: the turn to “Only mourned” edges toward aphorism but is earned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (penance) is clear and pressurized by the imminent burn order; her “carefully reckless” nature is dramatized in the choice to sing and spend the last indigo. Interiority is specific (violets, iron, old paper) and her final shift—trusting her own voice—feels earned. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. audacity) is present in action, not summary. The visible cost is modest but present (shattered inkwell, accepting a dangerous shard and its burden).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives are clear and embodied through tactile work—reading glue as “language,” weighing the chain, and choosing public risk over safe compliance. The internal contradiction (praise and “safety” vs. a gentler design that invites scorn) is credible, if resolved swiftly. Her micro‑choices (how she opens the envelope, how she presents the chain and blueprint) reveal priorities without therapy‑speak. The quick elder assent softens the felt cost of that final stand.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, particular interiority (“the ghost of pipe smoke…a second skin”) and contradictory impulses (renounced music yet reading dust like scores; lying to Holloway while sending for Luca) drive credible micro‑choices. Motivation tightens from guarded ritual to a risked outreach. The closing hum feels earned, though the on‑page price is more implied than pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, escalating motivation (find/protect Liora) evolves into a risked acceptance of her autonomy. Interiority is embodied and specific—wood grain as arrow, crows gone quiet—revealing contradictory impulses (rescue vs. respect). The final choice to hand her the logbook and not extract her feels earned with visible cost. Minor convenience in his symbolic leaps (grain reading) keeps it shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s longing for a “frequency” of home versus her self-chosen isolation generates a credible, felt tension, and her final refusal to surface with Kael reads as an earned endurance with cost. Interiority is concrete and individuated through her mapping practice and attention to bioluminescent “constellations.” Kael is sketched efficiently via gesture (scar, movement, careful grip) and exerts real relational pressure without stealing POV. The hand‑holding and then her choosing to stay below crystallize her hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, specific interiority and motive (“before memory faded”; to locate the “missing pieces”) drive concrete micro‑choices: plucking seeds, pressing her ear to glass, gathering shards, and finally letting the memories in. A credible cost appears (iridescent blood; “heart heavier with the weight of a thousand half‑remembered lives”). Some inner contradiction glints (“kindness” vs “cracks in something far more fragile”), though it could stress her reluctance more. Overall, actions align with motives and culminate in an earned internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear drive: Lior engineers pattern from crowd and elements, not coins, and endures misunderstanding as cost. Interiority is specific (timing the torch, listening for the tide) and embodied through micro‑choices. Internal tension (connection vs. control) is implied via the moth‑shawled woman’s line and his refusal. A deeper fracture or moment of self‑risk would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: a self‑imposed exile who chooses to “fledge” via ink. Embodied interiority (“her fingers trembled,” the dust “bit…with hunger”) gives texture without therapy‑speak. Internal conflict—love of the sea vs. chosen silence—persists beneath the act, though struggle is more contemplative than contested. Micro‑choices (watching for gaps, dipping for Orion’s reflection, pressing the dust) track cleanly to the culminating act.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives (attention as devotion, answering his daughter’s question) are clear and embodied through ritual choices: polishing, selecting a stone, reading ripples, setting the prism. The interiority is specific and textured, not label‑speak. Internal contradiction is subtle (faith in attention vs. acceptance that the harbor forgets), yielding an earned stasis. The cost—solitary endurance against forgetting—registers without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and pressurized: fear of harming his daughter versus the need to reach across silence. Embodied detail (gloves on warm scarred bark; gravel voice; rough hands drawing) grounds his contradictions. Micro-choices progress credibly—opening the box, drawing, texting, then leaving the box—each revealing value trade-offs. The renunciation (leaving the box) carries a felt cost and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motives and perceptual bias are specific and consistent, and her tactile, equation‑minded choices (arranging fractal decorations, interpreting the gauge) feel character‑particular. The logic/dreamer tension is credible and embodied through the tide and tools rather than labels. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; pressure never forces a hard, value‑charged trade. The renunciation—letting the tide take her work—lands but with limited interpersonal or moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motives are clear and pressure-tested: a compulsion to map echoes collides with the inherited weight of his parents. Concrete micro-choices (following the altered hum, opening the sealed door, re-rendering maps as faces) reveal internal contradiction—curiosity vs. dread, cartographer vs. son. Embodied details (the damp stone pulse, brittle negative, breath in the cold) ground emotion. The shift from mapping to living reads earned with a felt legacy cost rather than tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are clear: a disciplined maker of costly mercies who refuses her own reflection. Micro-choices under pressure—letting the mirror slip before it can show her face; pressing the cracked mirror to unravel the heartbeat—reveal values with cost. Emotions are embodied through tactile engagement with mirrors and the bells’ clock. Her earned stasis (renunciation) feels credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Veyra’s steady, trained gentleness undercuts cynicism without erasing it, and Kael’s hard shell cracks on the specific memory (“for the children we haven’t buried yet”), giving the choice weight. Interiority is compact but embodied through ritual handling of the clipboard and the pen. The final “Probably” preserves flaw and ambiguity with cost. A touch more contradiction-in-action for Veyra under peak pressure could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s inner contradiction—architect of scarcity yet steward of a last egg—drives concrete micro‑choices (reading the cracks, kneeling, placing the egg). His denial (“Not out of guilt. Not out of hope.”) plays against the embodied act to reveal character. The cost is conceptual and personal: releasing control and legacy repair through a private, unverifiable gesture. No relationship crucible is present, but the single‑POV interiority is precise and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive—defying the “lullaby of conformity”—is clear and enacted through tactically precise micro-choices (the three distinct thread-unlock beats). The “chaste courtesan” restraint versus her deliberate transgression provides a credible internal tension without over-explanation. Embodied emotion is strong (“her body a living poem of restraint”; “her body humming with…voices”). If there’s a limitation, it’s that she meets pressure with near-perfect poise; a touch more visible struggle would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (hands serene though he isn’t; the lightning‑struck stick as tactile conscience). His motive—testing a theory of truth as manipulation—drives a credible renunciation. The miner’s outburst wounds him in a way that forces a change in method, not a tidy resolution. The final choice to “let the puppets stumble” reveals a hierarchy of values with cost: ceding control for ethical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is specific and credible—“to honor what the world forgot”—and his method (twine, bone, wind-readable patterns) reveals character. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (knotting, weaving, waiting) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is faint; he rarely wavers, so the emotional tax lands more as quiet endurance than contested choice. The earned stasis at the end feels right but light on visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elira’s guilt-driven motive is concrete and sustained, and her micro-choices (unbraiding to “reconfigure,” choosing to let names change) align with her craft and history. Embodied emotion (“chiseling regrets from her own ribs”) avoids label-speak. The cost—relinquishing ownership and allowing the card to dissolve—reads on the page. Internal contradiction (preserve vs. release) is present, though not maximally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s curiosity and susceptibility to being “chosen” are dramatized through embodied beats—the hot wafer, the film’s counterfactual, the final renunciation of certainty. Contradictory impulses (ask why vs. surrender asking) culminate in a credible cost (wafer to ash; crossroads removed). A slightly abstracted inner life at peak beats (the aphoristic terminal prompts doing some thematic lifting) keeps us from a deeper micro-choice texture. Still, actions track motives cleanly and the change reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Qishti’s frugal habits and empiricist temperament are dramatized through specific micro‑choices (counting tiles, returning at dusk, tracing lines), not labels. His internal tension (numbers vs. faith) is active at the threshold—“a covenant offered to the unknown”—and he pays a price (surrendering the tile, bearing marks). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular. A touch more embodied fear or physical jeopardy under the overseers would intensify the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—clinging to resentment vs. risking grace—are dramatized in scene, culminating in the choice to “press the pin…not to fix it, but to convince the past it could be different.” Dialogue sharpens motive without over-explaining (“You think grace is something you earn” / “I think it’s something you lose”). The relationship crucible with Kael credibly alters by the end, with a visible cost in relinquishing the music box’s hold. A few aphoristic lines flirt with neatness, but the emotional work remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear (escape memory/reclaim the brother) and choices embody it (breathing method, letting the fog take him, stepping through). Contradictory impulses—grounded craftsman versus erasure of boundaries—coexist credibly and resolve in a renunciation. Emotions are embodied via tactile engagement with the sextant and the fog rather than label-talk. The cost of letting go is felt but remains somewhat gentle, softening peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and specific, with clear motivation to reconnect and comprehend the daughter driving concrete choices (digging, planting, untie/bind, apple bite). Contradictory impulses—pride versus humility, duty versus love—surface credibly in the question “What did you see that I couldn’t?” and the ribbon-binding. The emotional cost is felt, if quiet: relinquishing rigidity and accepting the daughter’s stance. Slight softness remains in the absence of on-page pushback beyond memory and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Veyra’s drive to inquire is specific and embodied, with tactile choices (pressing the cameo to her temple, stepping into the orchard, selecting “neither document nor destroy”). Interiority is crisp and character‑particular (“bathroom—where the acoustics were best for thinking”). The internal contradiction—hunger versus the warned danger—is present but lightly contested; she rarely hesitates. The ending stance (curate via restraint) reads earned, though the felt cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (to beat the traveler to the Library and weaponize absence) are clear, consistent, and drive his manipulations. His flaw—predatory intelligence—meets cost when his calculus fails and he becomes “a gap.” Interiority is concrete (“he heard the whispers between words” and the tea laced with forget-me-not) and shows credible contradiction: empathy performed as tactic. The final renunciation/understanding is earned by prior choices and lands with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s motive to reclaim her erased twin is clear and consistent, with concrete, character-specific beats (the swatch on her scaled wrist; ripping the ledger page). The refusal to flee immediately to help others reveals a values hierarchy under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied, though internal contradiction is light until the stay/go moment. A touch more struggle or doubt at peak beats would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior conflict—training (archive) versus instinct (fable)—drives concrete micro‑choices: reweaving the rope, stepping through the door, and electing to “merge” rather than record. Embodied perception (“oil hung thick as incense,” warmth pulsing from the door) grounds her intellect. The final renunciation of documentation reads earned and character‑specific, with a conceptual cost. Slight softness: the price is subtle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation (preservation, listening) is clear and drives action, with tactile micro-choices (breath, stone to ice) under pressure. Interiority is particular to his craft, though internal contradiction is minimal, giving the arc a calm inevitability rather than fraught struggle. The renunciation of weaponization for invitation reads as a credible stance shift but the on-page cost is subtle. Single-POV discipline holds and actions align with values.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (rekindling the beacon to test the meaning in fractures) with embodied loneliness and competence; micro‑choices (climb, set, trace, press the fracture) reveal a specific hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—grief-driven retrocognition versus present-tense endurance—coexist credibly. The acceptance at the end reads as an earned stance rather than a neat fix. Slightly limited by the absence of a direct interpersonal crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Summer-Quill’s motive—extracting identity from curated echoes—is specific and sustained, and her renunciation feels earned by the “offered” memory and river/vault reframing. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with crystal, rain, fog, and shadow rather than abstract summary. The contradiction between control (measuring) and surrender (listening) is dramatized in micro‑choices (tracing where the shadow would fall; choosing not to record). The emotional cost—abandoning a lifelong method—registers without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s drive reads clean and character‑specific (lonely chant, tactile craft, refusal to heed the curse), and her micro‑choices under pressure (lighting the rag, choosing the highest tower) align with that. Interiority is textured through sensory bias rather than labels. The one limitation: minimal contradictory impulse—she rarely wavers—so the emotional price is implied more than felt. “The world was heavier… so was she” gestures at cost but doesn’t fully dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is textured and character‑specific; her silence, sidelong method, and final renunciation of the heirloom reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The contradictory impulse—refusing a neat answer while offering a costly, tactile gift—lands credibly. The fisherman’s presence applies gentler external pressure, but the relational cost is legible. Minor limitation: the crucible between them could tighten a touch more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular motives (safety vs. “sprouting”/silence‑collecting) drive choices, and the father–child crucible sharpens the final decision. Embodied perception (“air tasted like rust,” “honey and lightning”) grounds interiority. The contradiction (loyalty to father vs. refusal of the coffin) is present but the final beat could register a sharper internal tremor as the child leaves. Still, actions align with a coherent desire that intensifies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives are clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (dial adjustments, copper spoon, refusing to pry). The passenger’s embodied sorrow registers through gesture and staging rather than labels. Internal contradiction is minimal—Elias remains assured—which keeps the emotional range narrower than the prose invites. Still, endurance as vocation reads credible and earns the quiet renunciation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elsin’s motive and temperament (“wisely adventurous”) drive concrete choices with embodied beats (“Her breath hitched”) and a credible renunciation at the peak. Internal contradiction (the lure of ascension versus the decision to unmake it) is present but lightly dramatized. The cost—forsaking power and vanishing into myth—is felt though understated. A touch more friction or hesitation at the throne would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lior’s interior contradiction—compulsive severing for “clean” silence versus inherited duty to teach the drowning to breathe—drives a credible, pressured choice. Embodied perception (charcoal lungs, scarred wood, cold bronze) grounds his emotions. The closing renunciation/allowance (“You don’t have to let us in… but you have to let us go.”) earns his decisive act. The cost—abandoning lineage-stasis for uncertain release—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lina’s motives are vivid and particular—pyramid-scheme scars, a mother’s aphorism, and a bias toward mischief over virtue drive her choice to turn the bolt. Contradictory impulses coexist on the page (hesitation vs. appetite for leverage). The refusal to check the final buzz and the bleeding palm register cost and a foreclosed path. A hairline shortcoming: the hesitation resolves quickly, leaving minimal on-page struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s drive to redeem/understand his dynasty is clear and expressed through tactile micro-choices (striking the floorboard, tuning the mirror). The contradiction—decades of grasping by logic versus the earned pivot to listening—reads credible. Cost is somewhat soft (a renunciation more than a loss), but the arc from “ender” to “first to cross” is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear interior contradiction (vow-bound silence vs. the urge to act) culminates in the earned choice to “unsnap” and speak. Embodied emotion is vivid—the welded gauntlet, the shadows spilling—grounding the abstract. Motivation coheres from the siege’s refusal to applaud through to a reclaiming of agency. A slight remove remains; we feel him, but his specific stakes beyond self-liberation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives are clear and particular—the ache of his own closed file drives a quiet, service-oriented agency. Interiority is textured (the button as “a stubborn insistence on connection”) and actions align with that pain. The internal conflict—professional detachment vs. hunger to salvage stories—registers without grandstanding. Cost is modest but legible in his tremor and the boundary-crossing choice to intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motive—preserving erased histories—is clear, character‑particular, and her choices (using the key, choosing to act, later choosing to listen) align. The “not a hero but resourceful” contradiction adds credible tension without melodrama. Felt cost is implied (risk, arson, exile) more than lived in scene, limiting peak depth. Relationship pressure is minimal, with Rook as a voice rather than an embodied foil.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motive (to hush the prophecy) expressed through concrete choices; interiority is sensory and character‑specific. Contradictory impulses (urge to erase vs. compulsion to return) surface but could cut deeper in-scene. The micro‑choices around “playing subtractively” reveal values without therapy‑speak. Felt cost is the ongoing yoke to the grotto rather than a one‑time victory.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.7)
    Liora’s motives are clear and consistent—decoding the arbor’s language and assuming stewardship—and her choices (placing the speck, climbing, jumping) align. Interiority is economical but specific, filtered through tactile work (seed‑sorting, fingertip reading). The piece lacks a strong on‑page contradictory impulse or visible hesitation, keeping her arc confident rather than contested. Transformation carries cost, but the emotional friction remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is specific and credible: a tinkerer obsessed with broken things seeking permission to stop “fixing.” Interiority is embodied (charcoal, waterlogged relics, humming compass) and his renunciation reads earned by experience in the cavern. The contradiction—repair impulse versus surrender to uncertainty—plays in scene and culminates in letting the last gear go. A minor limitation is the lack of interpersonal crucible, keeping the emotional pressure largely self-generated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority grounds motive (envy, grief, fear of “weight”) and fuels concrete choices under pressure. Her contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. pull toward Veyra’s method—operate simultaneously at the crucible. The shift to “transmute herself” reads earned, with a conceptual cost of renouncing rivalry for responsibility. A touch of aphorism skirts patness, but her actions consistently reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive and temperament are cleanly etched—steady, modestly fearless, and attuned to souls—and her micro‑choices (plucking strings, scattering petals, inviting a joke) are coherent with that core. The shift from release to integration is earned by observation and experiment. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, which trims complexity. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, keeping the arc quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Embodied interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“proprioception screaming,” tourniquet pain as anchor), with credible micro‑choices under pressure (kneeling, dipping fingers, holding the basin). Motivation coheres: survival and the recovered “mathematics of mercy” drive each move. Contradictory impulses—trauma reflexes versus a compulsion to face the shrine—operate simultaneously. The final steadiness and repurposed strap earn the change without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s motive—seeking an “anchor” to translate what’s between the seen and unsaid—is clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (turning the painting, fitting the lens, stepping toward the light). Contradictory impulses (holding vs. letting go; map vs. weight) surface in scene rather than summary. Her reactions to objects (lens, brush, wet bristles) reveal a particular sensibility. The cost is quiet but present in the acceptance of a changed role and the painting going blank.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motive—diagnose the “ceiling”—is clean, and his identity as a fixer who chooses to unmake creates credible, felt contradiction. Interiority is textured via tactile noticing (“dust was a language”), not label-speak. The decisive renunciation (loosen the anchor bolts) is earned by the realization that repair would re-enslave the ghosts. A small miss: his fear or doubt could sharpen once more at the child’s‑laugh pendulum before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive—using forbidden craft to counter a world slip—tracks cleanly and intensifies into a renunciation that costs him his place and self. Interiority is spare but character‑particular (the press, the bottle, the frost as his lexicon of meaning). The decisive shift (“the system wasn’t the world. It was him.”) is earned by prior patterning, though contradictory impulses in‑scene are felt more as calm resolve than friction. Slightly more embodied hesitation under peak stress could deepen the human texture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive—revision over revenge—is clear, character‑specific, and drives his tactics; his choice to risk and then spend the shard for proof aligns with that core hunger. Interiority is textured (“he did not fear fragments. He collected them.”), and the small status clash with Taelis sharpens him. The cost lands in character terms: he loses the shard and forecloses further attempts for the sake of one charged demonstration. Slightly limited internal contradiction keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are lucid and character‑specific: a repairman whose ethic (“mending what isn’t torn”) collides with a curse that demands reclamation rather than repair. His micro‑choices—pressing the chip to his chest, choosing to “unwind something older,” letting the stone take his honesty—feel earned and escalate credibly. Embodied detail (trembling hands, ozone/copper) grounds the lyric voice. Internal contradiction (mender vs. fool/thief) remains alive through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s drive—seeking the locus where explanation collapses—threads cleanly from factory catwalks to the arch, and culminates in the on‑page cost of burning his father’s notes. Interiority is specific (the compass’s “hinged awakenings,” the ache at the keystone) and his fear of explanations that won’t come creates a credible contradiction. Micro‑choices (wading deeper, touching the stone, letting his hand drop) reveal values in action. The Earned Stasis at the end reads motivated rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives are clear (reach Port Veyra; make meaning) and his micro-choices under pressure—activating the slide, reconceiving his carving, relinquishing tools—track with his artisan worldview. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“driftwood… taught you to see the bones of the world”). Internal contradiction is subtle (commerce vs. communal marking), but the piece could press fear or doubt a touch harder. The cost lands in the forfeiture of the slide and the leaving-behind of his work.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s drive—to understand the night-blooming jasmine and the silence around it—organizes her actions (pressing her palm to the glass, deciding not to paint, writing a final postcard, leaving). Interiority is embodied (cold seeping “like a confession,” breath fogging the pane). The renunciation feels earned, though the aphoristic line she writes edges toward tidy. Still, the cost—letting the murals fade and walking away—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and intensify: a principled archivist pulled into mediumship chooses between bureaucratic erasure and a riskier fidelity to truth. Interiority is concrete (“neutrality was a lie,” “run, or parley”) and embodied through tactile choices (shells, locket, pages in water). The internal contradiction—archiving vs releasing—culminates in a credible renunciation. Minor note: the mediumship’s psychic toll is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear, character-specific motivation (rejecting comfort; choosing conception) drives concrete micro-choices: keeping eyes closed, gripping the bottle, then discarding it to begin work. Interiority is textured and embodied (“creak of his own bones,” scents as triggers). A credible internal tension—skepticism toward solace vs. longing to reanimate the town—animates the scene without melodrama. The renunciation of the bottle and commitment to labor reads as an earned, character-rooted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear motive and interior specificity: an aging oath scribe preserving the “shape” of vows. Contradictory impulses—duty to archive vs. humility before prophecy—surface in concrete micro‑choices (not recording the prophecy, sketching his fear instead). Embodied emotion is vivid (hands shaking, pulse “like a startled bird”). The renunciation at the end credibly forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive (protect the seed legacy against the vortex that “took” her mother) is vivid and consistent, and her “furiously tranquil” composure converts into precise micro‑choices (ignoring the chick; committing to patience). Embodied interiority—breath crystallizing, remembering her grandmother—keeps emotion concrete. The flaw/price is quieter (she spends the last heirloom) and partly offset by the new cap, slightly softening the felt cost. Still, the closing stance—accepting the vortex’s return while securing a tactic—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives and methods are clear and character‑specific; his “listening” ethos shapes every choice. The tension between the abbot’s caution and his own “reckless” improvisation provides mild internal friction. Under time pressure he makes a precise, risky adjustment that fits his competence. Depth of contradiction is modest, so the change reads as steady refinement rather than a contested inner turn.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motive—staying to listen and tend the stillness—drives every micro‑choice, culminating in defying alarms to welcome the star. Interiority is concrete and tactile (hand on dome, breath on glass), avoiding stock feeling labels. The protocol-versus-yearning conflict is credible and resolved through an earned choice. A few aphoristic lines (“strength wasn’t in armor, but in the courage to be porous”) brush the edge of told insight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Austere but specific interiority—his years of learned stillness, the teeth-ache pressure of the ghosts, the deliberate exhale—renders a coherent psyche under pressure. The contradictory impulse (preserving silence vs. consenting to break a sealed covenant) is dramatized rather than told. His refusal to speak even after renewal lands as an Earned Stasis with cost. Minor note: the inner conflict could peak one notch sharper at the opening beat of the box.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivations are clear and character‑specific: a timekeeper who can’t fix his own time, compelled by the urn and the note to seek meaning. Interiority is embodied through tactile rituals (adjusting the cracked lens, the warmth of the urn). Contradiction is present but subtle—weariness vs. compulsion, skepticism vs. hope—and could press harder under peak pressure. The final choice to “begin to wind the broken watch” is earned and aligned with his traits, with a felt—if mostly conceptual—cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and tactile micro‑choices (choosing the frayed feather, not looking up at the crack, wading after the kite) ground his motive of coaxing beauty from incompleteness. Internal contradiction is mild; he largely confirms a long‑held ethos rather than contending with a sharp counter‑impulse. The envy of the patched boat and the choice to leave some things unwritten offer a credible, if subtle, cost. Overall, strong specificity without a hard crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s devotion-driven motives are crystalline and embodied in tactile choices (wrapping copper, refusing the elders). The illness provides credible cost without melodrama, and her banter with Tomas reveals status and subtext. Internal contradiction is subtle (defiance framed as devotion), more endurance than conflict, but it’s convincing. Tomas’s micro-arc from skepticism to continuation adds relational pressure and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are coherent and particular—disgraced skeptic drawn by an “invitation,” father’s legacy, and the amber fly’s pull—culminating in a credible leap. Embodied cues (ozone, the fly’s warmth, the terminal’s questions) anchor emotion. The internal contradiction (skeptic vs. pilgrim) is present but resolves slightly cleanly rather than grinding under friction. The final renunciation (most never come back) lands as a felt cost tied to prior traits.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—he aims to coax life back into a scarred place—and his actions align (seed‑work, mapping hums). Interiority is embodied through tactile choices (breaking pods, salt, listening), but we get little contradictory impulse or live doubt. The renunciation of credit/markers reads as cost, though it’s quiet. A stronger on‑page friction testing his resolve would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rook’s motive to convert loss into closeness is concrete and embodied—old joints, twitching nose, the leaf burning his pocket. His choice to follow the cylinder’s riddle and finally submit to the vines reads as earned endurance with cost. Interiority stays character‑particular, avoiding therapy‑speak. Slight softness: the inner contradiction (fear vs. pull) is present but not deeply dramatized at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motives are clean and specific—duty, family custom, and the hunger to orient in a world without beacons—and her choices advance under pressure. The internal tension between recording only what exists and sketching what she hopes for surfaces at the inciting glimpse and resolves in the leap. Embodied detail (frost‑bitten rail, brittle sketchbook) grounds emotion without label‑speak. The renunciation of safety for the unknown reads earned by prior cues.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lirien’s motive is crisp—recover her master’s legacy by amending time’s calculus—and her choices align, from playful sacrilege at the chessboard to the disciplined refusal to flee. The Keeper functions as a credible counter‑pressure with a legible wound (the name in tear‑ink). Interiority is image‑driven yet character‑specific; however, contradiction is light—she rarely falters or doubts. The change at the end reads earned but the emotional price is subtle rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive—preserving “small gestures” against the penumbra—drives concrete choices (dust‑spelled steps, pressing the bishop until pain). The internal tension between telling and releasing resolves in her pivot to offer silence, an earned renunciation. Embodied detail (“until it bit”) keeps emotion textured rather than abstract. Minor reservation: her past as a crisis actor is potent but under‑pressured in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clear and charged: he seeks the stone to resolve the pain of buried talent. Interiority is specific and embodied (mercury eyes, silver residue, hunger-frequency pull) with a credible contradiction between avoidance and acceptance. The final renunciation—accepting “Keeper of the Unsaid,” door sealing—forecloses the old stance. One mild neatness in the epiphany (“planting”) keeps it just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is clean and personal—atonement for a missed “fourth move”—and his micro‑choices (plucking, pressing palm to metal, re‑weaving threads, choosing to look at the girl not the board) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (distrust vs. staying present, mastery vs. humility) surface without therapy‑speak. The culminating renunciation—playing to stay, not to win—feels earned and costs him status and control. Slight limitation: internal conflict remains elegant rather than bruisingly messy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive and agency are clear and consistent—she rejects the elders’ lie and acts with deliberate, embodied resolve (chalked fingers, bleeding hands). Interiority is particular and sensory, and her tactics adapt under pressure (sideways climb, choosing the fissure). The piece skews toward a singularly defiant stance with limited contradictory impulses in-scene, tempering depth. Still, the final renunciation/act reads earned and comes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise and embodied—the trembling fingers, the “half-drowned in doubt” reflection—and the contradiction between compulsive repair and the fear it’s not enough drives the final renunciation. Micro‑choices (which key, when to step, narrating to the void) reveal values under pressure. The ultimate let‑go forecloses the identity built on mending, with felt cost. Minor safety in overt thematizing (“kintsugi for the soul of the world”) keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motivation rooted in grief and a promise drives Elias through concrete choices (entering the cave, offering the shell, burning the paintings, the final leap). Interiority is specific and embodied (“the metallic tang of a held breath”), though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressureful. The renunciation of the quay life registers as cost. A touch more live contestation before the jump could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—beckoning boats by “whispers” to prove a gentler frequency—drives every choice, and his embodied costs (aching throat, relinquishing the cork) sharpen him. The relationship with Harkin functions as a crucible; handing over the cork reconfigures status without neat sentiment. His interiority is concrete (scent, vibration, texture) rather than abstract. Minor note: his struggle is more endurance/attention than contested decision, but it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s motive—building maps to navigate loss—flows cleanly from the lighthouse failure and her nightly labor, and her micro‑choices (translating riddles, phoning the woman, placing the censer on the sketch) reveal a steady endurance over magical thinking. Interiority is specific and embodied (“ache in her ribs,” listening to the censer). Internal contradiction is present but quiet (skepticism vs. ritualized belief), keeping the piece more stoic than combative. The earned refusal at the end (“And she would build”) feels true to her limits and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lior’s motives (survive the warlord, prevent the eye’s harm) are coherent and revealed through precise micro‑choices: biting the truffle, smearing the eye, and finally burying it. Interiority is specific and embodied (“fingers twitched—his tell”), with a sharp contradiction between the compulsion toward truth and the tactic of occlusion. The sister’s memory complicates his ethic without neat resolution. The final renunciation reads earned, with felt cost in giving up a putative “cure.”

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (decode, then return the borrowed memory) are clear and consistent with his vocation; his micro-choices—steeping the flower, pinning it back on, climbing to adjust the lens—reveal a principled endurance rather than a flashy turn. Interiority is specific (jars of preserved storms; noticing absences) and character‑particular. The contradiction is quiet but present: a keeper of things choosing to let one go. Cost is modest yet felt: relinquishing the boutonnière and accepting a witness’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s cautious, paper‑bound temperament rubs convincingly against the chip’s pull, and his late answer to “You promised you’d come back” motivates the final choice. Interiority is concrete (ink, mint, fungi) rather than abstract. The cost—foreclosing the path toward “the scent of ink and the weight of unsold maps”—is legible. Slight opacity remains about the specific history of the promise, but it doesn’t undercut the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motivation is clear and propulsive: the dreams and the grotto’s call drive a deliberate defiance of counsel. Interiority is embodied and specific (“air tasted of copper and old magic,” “she could run. She could scream.”). The final surrender reads as an earned, high‑cost choice given the childhood bargain reveal. Flaws are minimal; the ambivalence is credible and active at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive (to bottle “presence”) is clear and particular, and Liora applies precise relational pressure that forces his revaluation. The internal contradiction—capture versus offer—manifests in concrete micro‑choices (handing over the shell, choosing to “jump through”). Emotional texture is embodied (heat of the railing, hum in the shell) rather than label‑only. The visible cost is conceptual/vulnerable rather than material, but it lands credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Older Elias’s drive to “distill chaos into something legible” animates concrete choices (handing over the scroll; sanctioning its destruction). Interiority is specific and embodied (“feral nostalgia,” trembling hands) with credible contradictory impulses (myth-making vs. truth-telling). The relationship with Younger Elias functions as a crucible that forces a stance. The final renunciation carries visible cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias is concrete, competent, and wounded; his anosmia and past as an aromatherapist color every perception and choice. He makes micro-choices under pressure—studying the screw, deciding what to say, and ultimately reframing his loss as a guide. The relationship beat with the woman is brief but charged, revealing his values through what he returns (meaning, not repair). The endurance/renunciation at the end (“Some things couldn’t be fixed. Only witnessed.”) lands as an earned stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lian’s motive—to transform scars into stories before the storm returns—is clear and embodied through tactile micro‑choices (carving, tracing, pressing the crystallized tip to her oldest scar). Contradictory impulses (fear/anticipation; hunger/ritual restraint) operate simultaneously. The grandmother’s superstition meaningfully reframes her actions rather than serving as a platitude. The final renunciation of fear reads earned, with the loss/surrender of the quill tip as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motive (an overdue apology under time pressure) is clear and complicated by prior harm; Elias’s counter‑motive (ethically fraught sales to save the orchard) adds moral texture. Their micro‑choices—offering the bottle, agreeing to “step in,” choosing to stay for dawn—track with character. Interiority is economical but specific; pain is embodied (“It hurts”), and she withholds touch, honoring the cost. The relationship status shifts credibly from estranged to cooperative with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    His motive—to unravel the illusion—is clear and drives concrete choices (refusing the trap question, tearing the dictionary, not reopening it). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile encounters with the mutable book and breathing temple. The central renunciation (letting go of the “witness” role/history) lands with felt cost. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but could tighten into a sharper dilemma on the page before the tear.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives and contradictions are clear: devotion to inherited craft vs. fear of rupturing time, culminating in a costly renunciation. Embodied details (cracked goggles, smells of burnt copper, warmth of the key) ground interiority under pressure. The moment he lets go after the woman’s plea lands as an earned endurance choice with visible cost (abandoning the ship’s crew). Minor hedge: his private stake beyond professional duty could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s motive (a systems-blindness failure tied to her sister’s death) is specific, embodied, and drives each micro‑choice from scanning to offering her own signal. Contradictory impulses—engineer’s control versus the physics of letting go—coexist on the page and resolve in her renunciation (leaving the scanner). Emotions are grounded in tactile perception (pressure‑glow under boots, cracked lens), not labels. The only softness is a slight neatness to the final easing of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lila’s motive—seeking a non‑numerical answer under the pressure of her father’s condition—is clear and compels concrete micro‑choices (lighting the lantern, choosing blue, then refusing to choose). Interiority is specific (wet paper, old glue, mica reflections) and her contradictory impulses (trained rationalist vs. leaper) act simultaneously. The final renunciation (not choosing a single path) forecloses her father’s model with felt cost. A few thematic lines verge on abstraction, but her actions keep them earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias’s motive—answering wrong numbers to “teach endings how to begin”—is clear and consistent, with micro‑choices (tuning the glass disc, deciding “Try again tomorrow,” hanging up first) revealing his guarded compassion. The relationship pressure with the caller is credible and specific (“I don’t know how to hang up” → his choir remark → her crying). Interior contradiction is present but subtle: he curates estrangement yet aches for connection, evident when he nearly tells her she’s not ready to loop. A slightly deeper on‑page cost beyond ritualized distance could intensify the change.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, particular interiority and embodied choices (“pressing the vellum to her chest,” “she did not look back”) ground motive in grief and duty. The contradiction—burdened by memory yet actively regenerating covenant—feels earned. Minor limitation: pressure stays mostly interior with few live external constraints to force harder trade‑offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s competence and pragmatism are vivid and consistent, and her contradiction—skeptical of magic yet leveraging belief—pays off in the final renunciation. Her micro-choices (fixing the radio, bartering bread via story, leaving the rock) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is economical but specific; we feel her ethic of reciprocity. Secondary figures (Mira, Carter) serve as precise pressure points without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s motive—mapping grief through the stillpoint—is clear and embodied in sensory, character‑specific ways (tasting sorrow as salt, longing as copper). His agency appears in pursuing the silence, kneeling, and accepting “mapped, not erased.” Internal contradiction (seeker vs. accepter) is present but gentle; pressure rarely forces a hard trade‑off. The cost is felt more as endurance than as a torn choice, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (pen, breath, vellum), with a credible tension between doubt and a stubborn, data‑driven faith. His micro‑choices—reanimating the pen, accepting the message, and deciding to plant again—align with his worldview. The shift from “correcting” to “layering” reveals change without sentimentality. The cost is quiet (relinquishing control over erasure), but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivations are clear (stealing back what time erased), with embodied, character‑particular action: Elias “maps silence” and Liora uses the camera as shield. The “no/yes/now” beat captures internal contradiction under pressure. Status and relationship dynamics shift when Liora’s quiet charisma hardens into a blade. Slight limitation: interiority remains mostly externalized through gesture, leaving a touch of depth untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation and contradiction are clear: his compulsion to erase his own work warps into a grim mercy, especially as he finds the ledger and chooses to burn it. Embodied reactions (“gloved fingers,” “breath shaking”) ground interiority. The self‑portrait as a map reframes his past flaw into present purpose with cost. If anything, the guilt/absolution turn is asserted a touch directly, slightly smoothing ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation is crisp and embodied: she rejects the doctors’ theft and chooses a risky, self-devised method to reclaim her mind. The quiet sabotage history concretizes “quietly rebellious” rather than merely stating it. Interiority is specific (finger drumming, breath and tremor) with a credible progression from poise to strain. Slight limit: internal contradiction is modest; the piece favors resolve over fraught ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s interiority is concrete and character‑particular—the “walks as confessions” lens and the coin habit reveal a lived method. His motive (quiet over force) coheres with his tactics under pressure, especially the refusal to answer and the choice to move past the challenger. The endurance/renunciation in the final invitation reads earned, though the felt cost is subtle rather than sharp. Minor ding: a few aphoristic statements flatten complexity around his skepticism vs. belief.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The boy’s shame is embodied (trembling hands, hitching breath) and his micro‑choices (kneeling, touching water, staying to watch the light) register a credible internal shift. The guardian’s intent is legible through action, not speech, and the gift of the mirror implies cost and commitment. Relationship dynamics are spare but effective; her silence and his halting lines create subtext. The change (lighter steps, father’s later softening) feels earned rather than announced.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s motive is clear and character‑particular—chess logic applied to civic defense—and his micro‑choices (notes with coordinates, mobilizing kids, deploying filings) align with that. Interiority is textured through sensory bias (iron filings, breathing stone) rather than label‑speak. The piece lacks a strong contradictory impulse or visible personal cost beyond risk‑implied logistics, which keeps it from the highest band. The brief exchange with the child elegantly reframes his stance without neat sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Embodied, particular interiority (“ribs ached to expand, to detach from the weight of the land”) and tactile action root Elias’s motivation in a credible pull toward the sea. The theft of the scrimshaw and dockworkers’ charged avoidance add texture without overexplaining. The acceptance comes quickly, limiting on‑page ambivalence, but his renunciation of the land reads earned. A felt cost is present in leaving his human life and “past,” though the hesitation beat is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives are clear and particular: resisting the residual “hush” while relearning honest feeling. Contradictory impulses—habitual stillness vs. desire to release—culminate in the raw scream, with Harkin as foil sharpening her choices. Embodied detail (whittling, bouquet, tin) keeps emotion grounded. The change is modest but felt, foreclosing the path of performative coping.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elira’s motive—seeking a “tremor of certainty” and then surpassing it—is clear and consistent, and her tactile choices (walking the spiral, touching quartz, kneeling to the lake) reveal character. The internal contradiction (reverence vs. transgression) is present but lightly contested; she faces little resistance and shows minimal doubt in the moment. The cost reads as identity-shed and heresy risk rather than a concrete sacrifice, which softens pressure. Still, her agency steers every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives—fear of post-phoenix silence and desire for connection through non-visual languages—are concrete and consistent, and his micro-choices (marigold “yes,” thorn “patience,” “Stay”) align. The relationship with Liora modulates his actions credibly and reveals values (valuing the cracked vase). Internal conflict is present but gentle; the felt cost remains modest, softening the final renunciation/embrace. Still, the characterization reads particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—seeking the “texture of connection”—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (placing/turning the lens, striking the bell). Interiority is specific and consistent, with the pilgrim vs. scholar tension adding mild contradiction. Pressure remains gentle, so struggle and visible cost are subdued. The renunciation at the end (leaving the bell, accepting the unfinished pilgrimage) reads earned if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s motives are clear and embodied—grief drives tactile choices (tattooing, folding, placing cranes). Contradictory impulses (to hold and to release) are dramatized in the “curtains of intention” motif and her shift from lilies to cranes. The pain of inking her skin and the vulnerability of scattering coordinates register as credible costs. The arc edges toward tidy insight but remains earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s curiosity-driven method and micro‑choices (buzzing the visitor up, aligning tape to cards, refusing sympathy, handing over the tape) reveal a coherent, particular character. The visitor is thinner but functions as a pressure source. Interiority is embodied through tactile tools and perceptions rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is mild (skepticism vs. ritualistic method), keeping the arc strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear motive (purify the past without repeating doom) and a credible inner tension (hunger for knowledge vs. refusal to reenact patterns) drive her choices. Embodied markers—dust, hum, the counterclockwise “unmaking”—anchor emotion without therapy-speak. The recoil at seeing an older self offers a brief, real wobble before recommitment. The arc from seeking answers to seeking “the silence between them” earns the renunciatory ending, though the struggle resolves a touch smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives are clear and character‑particular—her dusk‑noticer acuity and research history make the shadow trade feel earned. Interiority is embodied via tactile engagement with the stone (“softly deliberate” resistance) and sensory attention to light. The choice carries cost (a thinned shadow), though contradictory impulses (self‑protection vs. stewardship) could surface one more notch under pressure. Still, the renunciation reads credibly as an extension of her core flaw/gift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, embodied interiority with credible contradiction: a former con artist who heals animals and people to recalibrate his own moral center. Micro‑choices (salve, market errand, letters) align with motive and expose cost without self‑absolving. The chameleon care tracks his self‑repair persuasively. Slight softness remains as external resistance is minimal, keeping stress on his psyche rather than true pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s drive to decode wounds and her compulsion for closure are embodied and specific (archive work, the scar-touching, the pen note on her mother’s file). Contradictory impulses are present: the urge to read/solve versus the surrender to carry. Her actions align with motive and escalate credibly, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her old tactic. One slightly declarative line (“Some stories weren’t meant to be read”) edges toward telling but remains earned by prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—recovering the “goodbye letters” embedded in film—is precise and drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the renunciation implied by turning off the projector. Interiority is embodied (“hunting for the place where unused love went to die”; “thief of echoes”) and character‑specific. The contradiction between theft and release lands at the end without tidy self‑explanation. Minor risk of lyric self‑mythologizing, but it stays in character and under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and consistent—answering the aurora’s call and freeing trapped creativity—and her micro‑choices (stepping under, kneeling, “singing” with the instrument) align. Interiority is vivid and particular (“moonstruck dreamer,” hearing sky‑whispers), with embodied sensation. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely struggles or resists, so the change reads more as fulfillment than contested transformation. The cost (losing the whispers) is present but not deeply felt emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hollow’s motives and micro-choices are clear and embodied: pry open the crate, take the spark, wind the clock, accept stewardship. The “never dreamed” frame sets a credible internal lack that the ending reverses. Internal contradiction is modest (guard vs. caretaker) but present. Emotional texture remains concrete (weightlessness “like holding a breath”) without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear (to “unravel the hum”), and micro-choices track: he presses the gear to his temple, reaches for the shadow’s compass, then renounces unraveling to “become” the hum and leaves the gear behind. Interiority is embodied (gear warmth, laughter that isn’t his) and consistent. The change—foreclosing wandering as identity—reads earned. A true contradictory pull is faint; curiosity largely governs without much counter-impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear, embodied interiority with a credible contradiction: a lifelong crosser who discovers the courage of staying. Small, specific actions (pressing the star into her palm; not retrieving the punch) reveal values under pressure. Motivation is consistent and intensifies toward renunciation. Minor safety in the communal validation line (“Now you’re one of us.”) slightly softens the edge of her solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (numb arm, molar‑thrumming note), and his contradictory impulses—duty to “safety” vs. a dawning refusal to stay silent—play simultaneously. His micro‑choices accumulate (pocketing the bolt, breaking the wax’s taboo, handing it over, deciding to “stay”). The pianist functions as a charged foil without stealing focus. The final renunciation—choosing truth over enforced quiet—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veythas’s restraint, longevity, and loyalty to Lirien ground a clear motive, and the sacrifice of her name adds precise cost. The three‑centuries delay sets a credible contradiction he finally resolves. Interiority stays character‑specific (“the sound like shifting sand”) rather than generic. Minor limitation: the internal tug between duty and friendship could surface one more beat before the naming.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s motive is clear and particular—evidence‑driven obsession reframed as sentimentality by Voss—and it coheres through micro‑choices (nightly assembly, tapping, stepping onto the road). Embodied perception (gauges’ clink‑clank, warm stones) grounds emotion. Internal contradiction (scientist vs believer) surfaces credibly in the refusal to “report.” The choice to follow over protocol carries felt cost and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s motive—refusing the lull and hunting for meaning—is clear, embodied (bare feet, opera glasses), and her micro‑choices (touching the stone, using the glasses, handing them off) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“awkward confidence,” toes curling), though internal contradiction is light. The final stance shift to catalytic purpose reads earned, but the felt cost is muted. The scout adds a faint relational crucible but doesn’t pressure her values meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s motives are vivid and consistent—gardener over dogmatist—and her micro-choices (going to the springs, decoding, speaking “Rebirth”) track under pressure. Interiority is grounded in tactile perception (steam, vines) rather than labels. Internal conflict (Council duty vs. living tradition) is present but not deeply torn; she faces risk with notable certainty. The relationship turn with the grandson lands but resolves quickly, limiting felt interpersonal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Embodied interiority is specific and credible; contradictory impulses (wanting to hate the tourists, choosing not to correct “bird”) reveal depth. The somatic coping (“press your palms…”) grounds emotion in body rather than label-only affect. The decisive act—releasing the photograph—forecloses a path with a felt cost and enables a believable, modest reorientation. Mild therapy-speak risks abstraction but is anchored by tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive and contradiction are clear: a portraitist drawn to the dark, surrendering the urge to “capture” in favor of unmaking. Embodied cues (salt, parchment, cane seat unraveling) root her interiority. The renunciation of “artist” to “canvas” reads earned and costly. A touch of declarative thesis (“This was how you painted truth”) slightly flattens the otherwise organic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (hunt the slow-thief) is clear, and his interiority is embodied (“serene anger,” the memory of the first village, the altered veins). The pivot from retribution to understanding is earned by his realization that “time…fractured” and the symbol’s reweighting. Micro‑choices under pressure—walking instead of running, spilling the ink pattern he fears, then stepping through—reveal a credible value hierarchy. The cost is legible via recalled damage from prior passage and the renunciation of the kill.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound incineration vs compulsion to read/act—are dramatized through embodied beats (warm paper, fogging breath, isolation chamber). Her covert history (false compliance reports, hidden discrepancies) earns the final self-immolating choice. Micro-choices (hesitation, then inputting commands) align with a specific value hierarchy. The brief face-off with the Overseer confirms her stance without softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motives—preserving the roses and her father’s ethic of “engraved quiet”—drive concrete micro-choices (tying the strip, sheathing and then using the knife to carve continuity). The internal conflict between leaving and staying is implicit but felt, especially in “You were supposed to leave.” The endurance choice at the end forecloses a path with cost. Slight limitation: tension remains mostly contemplative rather than pressured by an active counterforce on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    His cool-headed endurance and grief are embodied through tactile choices—pressing a palm to soil, “voicing silence,” releasing the shard—rather than declared. The internal conflict (longing for his daughter versus refusing the counterfeit echo) sharpens under pressure and culminates in a costly renunciation. Micro-choices track his hierarchy of values cleanly (digging where the soil “refused to hum,” letting the shard bleed into the garden). A slight remove from visceral destabilization under peak stress keeps this just shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lydia’s motives (truth vs. filial loyalty) are clear and intensify with the ledger’s “Final payment—V. Estate.” Her interiority is specific (observatory acoustics, ledger textures, secretary’s flinch) and her micro‑choices (start a new ledger of questions; decide to publish) feel earned. The contradictory impulses register on the page, though the cost remains mostly emotional and could be sharpened. Secondary characters apply light pressure rather than crucible‑level force.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motive (to silence guilt) is concrete and grows under pressure, culminating in a hard, costly pivot to witness rather than erase. Contradictory impulses are active on the page: feeding the machine vs. pressing her wrist to the fracture vs. reaching for the crying child. Embodied specificity (tattoos, firmware hiss, amber heat) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The ledger realization risks abstraction but is earned by her choices and the on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lior’s motives and temperament are vivid—he refuses the village’s “unlearning” and pursues meaning through making. His micro‑choices (pocketing the flake, beginning the mandala, plunging his hand in, drawing an unfinished path in the square) align with a coherent value system. Interiority feels embodied rather than labeled. The main limitation is a lack of strong contradictory impulses under pressure; he rarely wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive—defiant memorialization through naming—reads consistent, embodied, and specific; the broken fingers and steady hands under threat texture him beyond trope. His gentleness and “steel” create a credible contradiction enacted in his refusal to stop. The commander’s wavering and kneeling sharpen status dynamics credibly within the scene. Minor note: his interior remains largely unwavering, offering endurance rather than a richer internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lydia’s motive—an encore impulse recast as rescuing others—drives specific choices (following the path, giving the coin, pulling the “timeline” taut). Her interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. Elias is sketched efficiently yet credibly; his turn arises from pressure rather than a speech. The cost (he’ll forget; she remains the unseen hand) lands as an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s “affectionate skeptic” stance is embodied and consistently drives choices, especially the follow-or-paint hinge. Interiority is textured (“believed in gravity but not gravity’s intentions”) and contradictions operate simultaneously under pressure. The cost registers in the sliver dissolving and in leaving the studio for an unknown path. Minor hedge: the potential ego-dissolution risk is evoked but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motive (rebellion against the councils; desire to “become the voice”) paired with embodied perception and micro‑choices (touching the fossil, speaking to the cave). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular. However, internal contradiction is minimal and costs remain mostly implied, softening the felt pressure on decisive acts.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—prevent the hourglass’s shattering—drives concrete choices, and his craft habits (ledger, needle, thread) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is grounded in tactile beats (ribs ache, breath hitch), not labels. The contradiction between reverence for time and willingness to risk “We do” registers, if quietly. Internal conflict is more muted than searing, but the final renunciation/acceptance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s interior conflict—prudence vs. daring—acts in the moment (hesitation, then opening the pillbox) and culminates in a choice with visible cost (relinquishing the pillbox, re‑engaging). Embodied details (breath held to avoid misting, burned cheek, tracking eye) individualize her. The ally’s pressure focuses her flaws without stealing agency. A few lines edge toward tidy thesis (“This wasn’t about the network…”) but the choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman’s long‑trained vigilance and restraint motivate the central choice cleanly, with embodied cues (pulse quickening, hands closing on reins). Interiority is quiet but particular; the decade of learning to “listen” replaces platitude with practice. Relationship pressure from the merchant and the girl creates a light crucible that sharpens his stance. The internal contradiction (duty vs. impatience or fear) is implied more than dramatized, keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, coherent motives (returning to the oasis, embedding the glass, leaving the bowl) and tactile interiority; the “phototropic to kindness” trait reads specific. Internal contradiction is mild—he seems already aligned with the choice he makes—so pressure on his values is light. The renunciation (leaving the glowing bowl behind) lands but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s motives—coaxing growth as a counter to war-scarred closure—are precise and embodied (blood in soil, trembling hands). Contradictory impulses (guardedness vs. tending/hope) operate simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choices under pressure—accepting Elias’s tool, planting the seed, allowing the song—feel earned. The relationship dynamic adds gentle pressure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s guilt‑driven scholarship and desire to “translate” his isolation are clear, embodied, and tested under pressure. Contradictory impulses—penitence vs. release—coexist through beats like shielding with the sundial and letting the bird go. The decisive renunciation (stop asking forgiveness, leave the library) is earned by prior beats. Minor aphoristic lines edge toward tell, but motivation and change remain credible.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s vocation and ambivalence (“It’s not mine to give”) create a credible internal conflict that culminates in surrendering not only a client’s remnant but her own. Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than generic. The cost remains mostly internal and gentle, with limited friction beyond the moment’s lyric consent. Still, the second spiral choice markedly reveals values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives are clear and driven by professional pride, skepticism turned defiance, and a cautious need to prove agency. Interiority is textured and embodied (“pressure in her skull,” “fingers that remembered every notch”). The push-pull between caution and audacity is dramatized in the 48-hour calibration and the risky transmission. The felt cost is modest (job jeopardy and physical strain) but credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, compelling motive (the key) collides with embodied claustrophobia; fear presses choices (“lungs tightened,” hands that once shook). Micro‑choices under pressure feel specific: using the compass to open, then choosing to drive the key into the table. Interiority stays character‑particular (father’s “honest thing” reweighted) though the contradiction could cut deeper at the peak. The closing endurance—still afraid of dark yet changed—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—guilt‑driven witnessing rather than vengeance—is clear and consistent, and his face‑blindness meaningfully shapes perception. Micro‑choices under pressure (descending, using the lance, not reaching for the echo, speaking Liora’s name) reveal a disciplined, rule‑bound temperament pried open by empathy. Contradictory impulses—methodical detachment vs. buried feeling—coexist on the page and culminate in an earned renunciation (accepting no legal justice). The cost is legible in his acceptance of secrecy and the quiet burden he carries out of the quarry.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—redeeming Orin Vey—drives every choice, and his contradictory impulses (safety vs. pressing the nail) surface under pressure. Interiority is specific (goggles fogging, the nail’s hum) rather than abstract. The renunciation at the end (burning the journal) reads earned and costly. Liora registers as a light pressure, not a full crucible, but that’s appropriate to scope.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive and embodied perception (“dynamically observant” gaze; scents of ozone/burnt sugar) drive choices, and the decision to step through is earned by the accumulating invitations. Internal conflict is present but soft—he considers, then commits with minimal friction. The felt cost appears in renunciations (“the bridge had nothing to do with it,” glass dissolving), though the struggle could sharpen. Character reads specific rather than generic, with credible micro‑choices (lifting the glass; setting bow to strings).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives and contradictions are clean: thief’s instincts vs a hunger to understand rather than take. Interiority is embodied (rust, greasepaint, bent bars) and specific to his lineage. The renunciation at the end reads earned through discoveries (lion cage, father’s spiral maxim). A slight tendency toward aphorism risks smoothing roughness but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s drive to decode the inscriptions and reconcile his sister’s disappearance grounds the piece; his shift from hoarding words to listening feels earned through on‑page sensory contact with the telescope/stars. Interiority is specific and embodied (ink‑stained fingers, breath fogging glass), not label‑speak. The contradiction—chronicler as healer vs. his deafness to the chorus—operates meaningfully. A slight smoothness in the epiphany (minimal resistance once the “voice” speaks) keeps this shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eldrin’s motive—find what took his brother—drives each choice, with guarded restraint (“War demanded stillness”) contrasted by the hunger he wields. The lie to the apparition (“I didn’t come for you”) reveals contradiction under pressure. The emotional cost of the revealed truth registers in his posture (“finally unbent”) and the choice to leave. Slight limitation: interior conflict is strong but largely implied rather than pressed into a moment of overtly competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motivation (heeding scars to unearth the eclipsed covenant) is concrete and consistent, and her embodied cost (weeping scar, prior three‑day rooting) grounds her drive. The “you’re early” beat creates a credible inner tension between urgency and patience that she resolves by running the bridge anyway. Micro‑choices (pressing clipping to sap‑weeping scar; veering through the maze guided by pain) reveal values under pressure. Slight softness: the renunciation or foreclosed alternative isn’t fully priced beyond pain and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive (to patch the holes in her soul) is clear and consistently pursued through concrete, risky action (the stitching/trade). Her “reckless idealism” is dramatized rather than told, and the moment she doesn’t resist the roots pulling the child’s name foregrounds a credible cost. Internal contradiction is subtler (resolve over fear more than push-pull), but it’s present in her need to mend versus the price exacted. The closing renunciation/acceptance reads earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied—dust, feedback, the tactile cloth—while his contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. private ache) act simultaneously. Micro‑choices (“I’ll take it,” leaving the station on, rolling the window down) reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost—relinquishing certainty and price as identity—is credible at this length. Slightly modest external pressure keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s grief, professional rigor, and “analogical thinking” create a coherent, specific psyche; his micro‑choices (climb, plant, touch, then choose to go back) align with motive. The renunciation—seeing his wife yet not staying—lands as a credible cost. Interiority is embodied (sap, hum, magnetic pull) rather than labeled. A slightly neater self‑diagnosis (“the spirit had been a hypothesis”) trims a trace of ambiguity but doesn’t cheapen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s choices (selecting the cupped-hand crucible that requires “two truths,” refusing to write the woman into the ledger) reveal values under pressure and a practical philosophy. Interiority is concrete and embodied (brass dials in his forearm, ribs aching with lunar shift). The conflict is gentle, so contradiction is more tonal than agonistic, but it’s credible for this mode. The woman’s brief presence productively tests his role without overwhelming it.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority (trembling fingers; “heartbeat of hesitation”) and a credible shift from duty to vulnerability power the choice to wear the pearl. The inspector’s motive evolves from retrieval to communal radiance with embodied cost (“the weight of every confession… became her own”). Internal conflict is mostly internalized and lyrical rather than dramatized against another person, but it reads credible. A few thesis-forward lines risk neatness, yet her refusal to report underscores a felt renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation and contradiction are precise: guilt, stubborn method, and the medication choice create live friction. Embodied moments (pressing the bellows to his forehead; boots crushing ivy) reveal him under pressure. The brave/sorry tension and his refusal to look back render an earned renunciation. Minor hedge: we glimpse the sister only through memory, limiting relational crucible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: she must record the unspoken before the second letter erases them, then pivots to write the truer letter. Interiority is embodied (veil snagging, watch burning) and particular, though the final realization veers slightly tidy. Micro-choices under pressure—climbing, opening the watch, tearing a page, abandoning the watch—reveal values with some cost. The turn from collector to speaker reads earned by prior beats but edges close to aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear and embodied: the contract, the lure of freedom, the plants’ plea, and the collector’s pressure. Micro‑choices (touching strings, lifting the counterweight) culminate in a decisive, costly act. Interiority is specific (coffee stains, plant whispers) rather than label‑speak. The visible cost—loss of pay, criminalization—earns the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s vocation and temperament coherently drive her choices; “beautician by trade and mortician by calling” shapes how she reads the aurora and treats the dead. Interiority is concrete and profession‑tinted, with tactile focus on breath, bone, and thresholds. The chip’s expenditure registers as a cost and a quiet renunciation. Internal contradiction (beauty/work with death; wanting a spark vs. accepting silence) is present, if subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maren’s motives and contradictions are precise and embodied: a caretaker seeking “the source” after forgiving yet still carrying grief. Her decisive choices (sacrificing the heirloom, plucking the shoot, giving the fruit to the arsonist) align with character and carry cost. Interiority is textured through tactile images (scalloped scars, bioluminescent moss) rather than labels. A hairline neatness in acceptance slightly softens the raw edge of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s vocation and flaw (“conscience for hire,” “sincerely insincere”) generate a credible internal bind that drives concrete choices—most powerfully in the tactile unhooking of the cloak’s knots. Interiority is embodied and specific (wind chime lexicon, oil and wicks, the shard’s whispers), and the renunciation of certainty exacts a felt cost. The arrival of the woman reframes his isolation without granting an easy cure. A few explicit self‑summations slightly dull the rawness of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to withhold and teach appearing before vanishing—reads cleanly through concrete choices (stone drops, silence, stepping into the dark). Interiority is embodied (hip ache dissolving, prismatic starlight) and character‑particular. The contradiction (vanish vs be seen) is live and resolved into a stance rather than a neat fix. Slight remove from immediate external pressure keeps the change quiet rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, particular interiority anchored in tactile perception (stone thrum, wind/echo reading) and a coherent motive (learn the old way, protect the pulse). The renunciation—becoming an anchor and drawing the Maw—reads as an earned endurance choice. Slight softness: he succeeds with minimal visible struggle, so contradictory impulses (move vs. stillness) feel beautifully framed but lightly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marlin’s motive (penance reframed as a hunt for the sacred in the simple) is clear and consistent, with embodied tells like numb fingers and the candle’s whisper anchoring interiority. His refusal of “mastery” and leaving the keystone registers as a credible renunciation with social cost. Internal contradiction (unremarkable/student failure vs stubborn devotion to imperfection) is present though a touch tidy in the epiphanic beats. The keeper adds pressure without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—obsessively seeking the color of sound—is concrete and embodied in tactile choices (wading into the wreck, turning the key, lighting the lantern). Interiority is particular (cobalt despair, amber longing) and the final act costs him the comfort of ignorance, replacing it with a charged secret. The leap “He understood then” borders on an easy epiphany, but it’s earned by prior beats. Emotional contradiction (awe/fear, longing/rigor) is present, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motive—pattern‑seeking faith against communal doubt—is clear and consistently dramatized through tactile choices (coin selection, spiral arrangement). Embodiment is efficient (“fingers trembled,” “breath fogging”) and the “madness” pressure sharpens her resolve. Internal conflict (hesitation vs. conviction) is present but subtle; it could bear one sharper moment of resistance before dissolution. The final renunciation (letting herself be pulled apart) reads earned by prior desire and method.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The reaper’s motive—shaping formless fears by naming them—is clear and character‑specific, rooted in his self‑inflicted hollowness. Micro‑choices under pressure (stepping into dusk light, pressing the fear‑spire into the Leviathan, tucking the atlas into his ribs, choosing not to look back) reveal a consistent value hierarchy. The regret line (“He already did”) adds moral cost without neat absolution. Slight remove and relatively effortless execution of the ritual reduce the felt struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—an earnest, stubborn bid to retune the world via a broken bell—is clear and consistent, and his “lukewarm” limitation usefully constrains tactics. Interiority is concrete (“called it math”), and the devotion registers through study and physical labor. The internal countercurrent (naive hope vs. worsening imbalance) is present but stays quiet; a sharper on‑page jeopardy or hesitation under peak pressure could deepen it. Still, the final vow and bled fingers earn the endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (guarding vs. grieving, silence vs. telling) are concrete and embodied through objects and micro‑choices (nailing photos, uncapping the bottle, burning the images). The internal contradiction is active on the page and culminates in a credible renunciation with cost. A slight ease in the transition from intent to catharsis keeps it shy of the very top tier, but it remains deeply character‑specific and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive and contradiction (rigor vs secret sentiment) drive concrete choices: lighting the flame, tilting the crystal, stepping through the door. Embodied detail (trembling hands, scent triggers) grounds emotion. The renunciation—leaving “the last shred of the girl” and the world beyond the waterfall—registers as a real cost. A slight softness: the admission of sentiment is told once rather than consistently pressure-tested by a counter-impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserve trust and prevent weaponization—drives clean, embodied choices (opening the buckle, leaping, refusing the radio). Fear coexists with duty without tidy resolution, yielding credible Earned Stasis. Internal texture is specific (pattern‑seer, muscle‑memory, fail‑safes) rather than generic bravery. Minor limitation: conflict remains largely internal, offering less friction to reveal deeper contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motive (protect identity/integrity under threat) is clear and intensifies into the risky merge; his embodied conflict (numb half-life vs surging “all of it”) reads specific and earned. Veyra applies precise relational pressure with status clarity (“They’ll rule in favor of the Original”). The pain and possible dissolution give visible cost to his choice. A hair of neatness remains in how confidently he executes an unprecedented mind-merge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motives—curating “doors ajar,” privileging stretch over win—drive every turn, culminating in the renunciation of conventional business for tending and community. Interiority is specific (tactile tea steam, the seed’s “alive-warm”) and decisions align with his ethos. The relationship with Lina adds pressure and reflection, though internal contradiction is light; he rarely hesitates. The cost is accepted with little struggle, trimming the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s ritualized grief, tactile bond with the pull cord, and control-vs-surrender tension are specific and embodied. His motive (coaxing laughter back) is consistent and his renunciation at the end feels earned. The cost—giving up the role that gave him agency with his father’s echoes—is legible. Minor softness: the real-laughter trigger arrives externally, slightly easing his internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyssa’s keeper/prisoner contradiction is specific and embodied: the ache in her teeth, the compulsion to wait, and the transgressive touch of the books. Her decision to surrender the pendant arises from the books’ “homesickness” and her own curdled purpose. The cost—relinquishing identity and control to be “read”—is clear. Minor quibble: we could feel a touch more resistance at the handover.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—to break past exile and failure by embracing “creative destruction”—is clear and escalates into concrete, risky choices (feeding memories and doubt, striking the heartstone, invoking the forbidden words). Interiority is specific and embodied (frosting breath, scars reversing) rather than labeled. A mild softness: once the method works, ambivalence fades quickly, limiting contradictory impulses at the peak. Still, the final stance feels earned with visible costs implied (heresy, opposition).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular—she tunes by unlearning—and her actions (pressing the fragment, surrendering to the note, jumping) align. However, internal contradiction is light; she faces little resistance once the note arrives, so change costs feel more conceptual than hard‑won. The brief “I thought I’d failed” moment is effective but quickly resolved. A deeper struggle before the leap would raise the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s competence, humor, and calm under pressure are vividly embodied (rope work, hourglass handling, “Course is relative”), and her micro-choices drive the scene. Motivation is clear—align and preserve the ferry and its passengers. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never wavers, so complexity is limited. The ghosts offer a relational accent but don’t deepen her conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—activating an installation to prove memories are communal—is clear and enacted through concrete choices with the sinew thread. Interiority is vivid (“thread…burned colder”) but internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers even when told dismantlers are coming. The woman applies pressure but he meets it with equanimity rather than struggle, keeping the change subtle. The cost—letting the woven grief resolve—is felt but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elira’s motive—learning and teaching a new way of navigation—drives every beat and reveals a patient, risk‑tolerant temperament. The tactile engagement with the chain and map shows character through action, not labels. Kael provides immediate pressure and status dynamic without stealing focus. The cost to Elira (defying elders, risking error) is implied more than felt, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradiction—“not a hero,” yet compelled to listen—grounds his choices and escalates credibly. His curiosity drives the scene (adjusting the frequency, touching the glove) and his embodied reactions (“knees hit the stone”) keep emotion concrete. The shift from assuring the living to witnessing the dead reads earned rather than proclaimed. Cost is present but mostly conceptual (sanity, professional credibility), not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (stand by the unremembered) and embodied contradiction (claustrophobia vs. compulsion) drive choices—pressing the seam, using the fleck, risking entrapment. Interiority is sensory and particular (“crashing hush”), not diagnostic. Minor telling lines (“He hadn’t come to steal”) skim the edge of abstraction but are supported by concrete action. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motive—transmuting bureaucratic erasure into agency—drives palpable micro-choices (pulling archives, gripping the shard, consenting to sync). Her contradictory impulses (control via counting vs surrender to the chorus) are present on the page and resolved through Earned Stasis. Embodied cues (fogged shard, pulse tracking) keep emotions concrete. The change forecloses the path of solitary vigilance with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Veyra’s drive is clear and particular—an inherited compulsion to translate texture into sound—and her fatal “should have stopped but didn’t” beat earns the cost. The copper-vein motif grounds her hunger as embodied flaw. Interiority is precise and non-generic, though largely lyric rather than dialogic. The renunciation failure at the cusp of peril reads motivated and seals a credible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s bitterness and obsession are specific and dramatized through tactile choices: digging, pocketing the arrowhead, laughing back as the garden closes. Contradictory impulses (hunger for answers vs. contempt for warnings) act simultaneously in scene. The herbalist adds pressure without hijacking POV. The metamorphosis reads as an earned surrender, with cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, embodied motive—she plays to revive a strangled orchard—and her micro‑choices (pressing the shell to her chest, stepping onto soil, refusing to stop) track under pressure. The interiority is specific and sensory rather than diagnostic. However, contradictory impulses are muted; we don’t feel a sharp inner split beyond resolve versus fear. The final renunciation/endurance reads earned but low‑cost emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and consistent: he risks drones to deliver meaning, not just objects, and adapts under pressure (the patrol gap, the detour to Seventh). Interiority is embodied and specific (“air tasted like the moment before an apology”), and his “respectfully rebellious” stance drives choice. The Lira exchange reveals status and worldview friction without exposition. Internal contradiction is mild, but his endurance choice at the end feels earned with a visible cost (risk, scar, ongoing burden).

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s craft-driven quietude motivates each move—finding the fragment, following the song, offering silence as an active stance, “singing with his hands,” then returning to work. While internal contradiction is subtle, curiosity versus reticence registers in his mute offering at the peak. Embodied perception (wood, sawdust, wind) grounds emotion credibly. The endurance choice—accepting an ongoing task instead of cathartic speech—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—to reawaken memory and move from hoarding to inhabiting—drives concrete choices (the ritual, then unlocking the restricted section). Interiority is specific and embodied through the scarf, chalk, and tessellations. The internal contradiction (protective solitude vs. risky openness) is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized. The final renunciation (losing the scarf’s objecthood) reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear motive (retrieve and “vitalize” the escaped dream) drives specific micro‑choices—aperture tweaks, whispered title, and finally the renunciatory “Stay.” Interiority is embodied through tactile objects (ink‑stained fingers, pulsing paper) and credible hesitation when the dream pleads. The contradictory impulses—custody vs. wonder—coexist on the page and culminate in a costly refusal. The choice forecloses freedom for the dream and innocence for the librarian, earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, particular interiority: the locksmith’s rule versus her compulsion to listen gives credible contradiction. Her micro‑choices (choosing memory over tools, pressing her thumb, telling the man “Go”) align with motive and history (the jammed locket). The man adds present pressure without stealing agency. The cost—relinquishing mastery to let the locked thing decide—reads as an earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—recovering what’s been taken and confronting the “thief”—is clear and intensifies as the pedestal hum/memory-surge raises the stakes. Interiority is specific (the “crisp ache” where feeling should be), and micro‑choices (wading deeper, pressing the mushroom to stone, invoking “remember”) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—accepting the heavy return of memory as the cost—reads earned. Minor reliance on summarized backstory is contained and purpose‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elspeth and Kael are sharply etched through action and subtext—her shard-gift and his trembling annotation reveal motive and fear without exposition. The mentor’s aim (“I’ll teach you how to return”) coheres with years of geometry-tactics and the combative tenderness in her instruction. Kael’s micro‑turn from hesitation to binding the shadow lands credibly. The visible cost is mostly deferred, softening the impact of her implied renunciation (withholding “the cost of coming back”).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motives (a hunger to shape the unseen) drive every key choice: entering the veil, giving away the seed, and paying in blood-tinged “essence.” Contradictory impulses register—silence misread as patience versus restless need—without neat resolution. Interiority is embodied through craft (knife, pruning), not labels. The final renunciation (leaving by dawn) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s trade, habits, and inherited tools ground a credible interior conflict between mending and releasing. The last‑knot decision distills his contradictory impulses—fixer versus truth‑teller—into a meaningful renunciation with cost. Embodied details (calloused fingers, silk, salt‑swollen knot) keep his emotion specific rather than abstract. Minor direct statements (“The net was a lie”) slightly flatten nuance but do not undercut motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to interpret silence and test the henge’s “rules”—is clear and enacted through specific, competent choices (overlaying films, threading her own reel, refusing to step through). Interiority is concrete and sensory (“hum in her ribs”), with a credible renunciation at the end. The primary weakness is limited friction or contradictory impulse on the page; her restraint is convincing but not heavily contested. Still, the endurance/renunciation reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s quietly analytic nature translates into precise, embodied choices: examining the globe’s counterclockwise snow, pocketing the notebook, leaving the globe, lying to the crew. Her grief (sister photo) and professional compulsion (last transmissions) create a live contradiction resolved by renunciation. The endurance choice—“No significant findings”—carries a visible cost that aligns with established traits. Minor: her leap to spacetime conclusions risks feeling swift but remains anchored in the ship’s library context.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The balladeer’s interior motive—translating the unspoken—drives credible micro‑choices and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses a path. His hesitation when the ghost “wanted out…into him” shows a live internal contradiction sharpened by embodied detail (heat, raw throat). The final refusal carries loss without overstatement. Slightly soft cost prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s warm inquisitiveness, work history, and present-tense decoding create a credible, specific psyche. The “prison vs lens” reframing is earned through her tactile engagement with the diary and environment. Micro-choices (opening the pages, interpreting numbers, choosing to climb) align with motive. The cost is modest but present: she embraces cold and solitude to pursue clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear, consistent motive—Elias seeks proof that absence holds memory—filters every choice, from letting the string snap to “falling into” the sky. Interiority is textured and embodied (the telescope’s weight, the air’s hum), avoiding stock feeling labels. The surrender is earned by prior yearning and practice (ledgers, father’s inscription). Slight softness: little counter‑impulse or resistance undercuts visible struggle at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and particular: the face-forgetting versus hand memory sets a credible flaw that drives choices. Her micro-decisions (coin by touch, building channels, refusing to run, painting “nothing”) show a hierarchy of values under pressure. The Earned Stasis at the end—accepting limits—feels motivated by prior failures and the night’s cost. Minor note: we glimpse little reactive fear in the collapse beat, but the calm reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motive and competence are clear and drive choices under pressure; her rule‑breaking curiosity feels specific and embodied (charcoal sketching, palm to glass). The status dynamic with Veyra shifts believably from reprimand to trust. However, internal contradiction is light—she rarely doubts or pays a visible price—so the change reads earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: a repair‑driven craftsman trying to mend a broken clock‑hall to reach her sister. Micro‑choices (whispering to a resistant gear, choosing not to question the child, reaching into the mirror) reveal priorities. Interiority is anchored in tactile detail rather than labels. The absence of strong internal contradiction or on‑page cost at the peak keeps it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives are clear (seeking the nebula, then shifting to building it) and her micro‑choices—ringing the bell, tracing cracks, finally committing “We stay”—align with a credible, altruistic arc. The contradictory impulse around Kael (“she didn’t want him to go”) adds human texture without melodrama. Kael’s steadiness reads as a defining trait that catalyzes others rather than stealing agency. Emotional embodiment trends quiet but specific; a deeper moment of on‑page cost for the choice to stay would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s vocation, wear, and private tether to the lullaby forge a clear, character‑specific drive, and his competing impulses (duty to delay vs. release with cost) are dramatized at the decision point. The physical handling of the puppet head, ear to wall, and trembling hands ground interiority. The renunciation—“for the first time in thirty years, Elias let go”—reads as an earned stasis with visible cost. A slight idealization of self‑sacrifice keeps it just short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s burdened competence and reluctant mercy are well‑drawn; the “refusing pleas” history sharpening the choice to help the girl lands. Interiority is specific (nuts, routes, frost windows) and action‑tied. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; we don’t see a visceral stumble at the peak so much as a steady endurance. The cost (spending the last nut, renewing a duty) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is acute and character‑particular (polymer bridges as a worldview), with credible embodied grief anchored to tactile acts (tracing foam, handling the chrysalis). The renunciation of “atonement as bridge” into “dissolution” reads earned through on‑page observation. Minor neatness in the inscription “The strongest connections…” edges toward tidy aphorism, slightly smoothing contradictions. The girl’s brief presence sharpens his values without hijacking the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives and methods are concrete and particular; her trade in “absence” is embodied through the obsidian needle and the renunciation of opening the moonlight. The micro‑choice “She reached for it, then stopped” reveals a value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority stays image‑driven rather than abstract. The conflict is quiet but credible, with endurance chosen over acquisition.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—tending and offloading others’ remorse before it drowns him—is clear and grounded in the tactile palette of a chef who tastes memories. Interiority is specific (citrus, burnt caramel, metallic regret) and actions align with motive (distillation, return to the pavilion). Internal contradiction is limited—he’s resolute rather than torn—so the emotional crucible is gentler than peak. Still, the Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to keep tending) feels consistent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives and tactics are clear and character‑specific (engraving the weight, bringing multilingual cards), and Elias’s resistance softens credibly in scene. Interiority is conveyed through embodied detail (choir “afterglow,” starlight, the weight in her pocket) rather than labels. The relationship dynamic meaningfully shifts under pressure without false neatness. Cost is present but modest; Liora risks censure and commits to sustained labor rather than a single grand sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an engineer self‑rewired into an “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” torn between control and surrender. Embodied beats—the trembling surgeon‑hands, knees hitting ground—ground the lyric thought. Her final acceptance reads earned by prior choices with a felt cost of self‑redefinition. A touch of aphoristic neatness (“the void had been inside her”) slightly tidies complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysara’s motives (brother, resistant texts, time‑pressure) drive concrete choices—following the whisper, keying the threshold, grabbing for a jar, later burning the smudge and deciding to plant the seed. Interiority is sensorially embodied (“prism‑mind,” hair pulled ceiling‑ward), with credible fear of running out of time. Internal contradiction is present but light (scholarly caution vs urgency); still, her renunciation of immediate power for a single seed carries a felt cost. The final stance—becoming the key—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear, embodied motivation—he wants to give the sculpture voice—and his micro-choices (ear to fissures, adjusting grip, strumming specific cracks) align with that desire. The inner life is filtered through tactile listening rather than abstract labels, which feels character-particular. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece favors devotion over tension, so stakes rely on endurance rather than a value clash. The visible cost is modest but present (numbed fingers, renunciation of the insulator).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. fear of “playing at all”—are dramatized in micro‑choices (hand to the ground, hovering over the pawn, ceding the worry stone). His motive to “translate the silence” is clear and consistent with his years as a tutor. The relationship with the girl becomes a crucible that forces a stance shift. The cost is subtle but present in the relinquishment of the stone and the acceptance of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior is particular and embodied—“collects silences,” stained fingers, tuning empathy—culminating in a credible turn from avoidance to action. The contradiction (pacifist tuning for quiet vs the need to break it) operates on the page and motivates the final choice. Cost is legible: he risks his defining stance to engage with the world. Minor hedge: the leap from private realization to public shop happens briskly but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motive (serenity within sway) is precise and embodied through olfactory perception and craft, driving theft, planting, and a public confrontation. Contradictory impulses—ambition vs. trust/community—surface in her risking censure for an internal need. Micro-choices (staying up, stepping closer when Elders recoil, plucking/pressing the petal, hanging the bridge) reveal a hierarchy of values. The cost is somewhat gentle on the page, keeping the arc a shade safer than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyra’s motive (mentor’s charge to find resilience) is clear and drives concrete, risky choices (banking hard, landing on the arch, reaching into the “mouth”). Interiority is embodied (“breath hitched,” the vibrating arrow tip) though conflict reads more one‑sided passion than contradictory impulses. The moss’s spread creates a credible internal shift with implied cost. The closing renaming of her role (“not just a pilot”) is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veyra’s guilt-driven rigor (“last time she’d trusted intuition over data”) collides with the necessity to “listen,” producing credible contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (entering the alley, pressing the container, running, lighting the flare) reveal priorities and cost. Embodied responses—itching patch, burning lungs, limp—keep emotion grounded. The renunciation at the end (from pure data to charged attention) feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motive—to reject the elders’ control and “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (theft, unfurling, each strike). Interiority is embodied via synesthetic perception, though her certainty leaves little contradiction under pressure. A few thesis-like lines (“silence was just another kind of cage”) flatten nuance at peak moments. The visible cost is mostly social and implied, not deeply felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s history as a relic keeper, his shame at “failure,” and his shift from sealing to following create a credible internal conflict with concrete micro-choices (uncasing, playing to widen, stepping through). Emotions are embodied via cold, hush, and tactile markers rather than labels. A couple of abstractions (“harvest insights from failure”) skim the surface, but the final renunciation reads earned. The cost—abandoning the guardian posture and name—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s drive—to distill the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear, embodied, and consistently tested, with credible contradictory impulses (control via disorientation vs surrender to being changed). The physicalization of empathy (“transposed” through the halo) grounds his interiority in action. His renunciation—letting go of borrowed voices, crossing out his name—reads as a real cost. Slight limitation: we glimpse the harm of his “borrowing” mostly in concept, not via a concrete interpersonal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear interior motive (mentor, “Find what hums”) and embodied nerves (“fingers trembled”) ground the courier; his choices (ripping the pendant, stepping onto the bridge, planting the seed, returning to the villages) reveal growth from hoarder of relics to conduit. The woman applies pressure that exposes his flaw (mistaking rarity for magic). Change is earned with a felt cost: surrendering the pendant/role. Interiority skews lyric over granular contradiction at peak beats, but remains credible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives (to prove echoes) are clear and pressure him into a costly choice; his attentiveness and skepticism produce credible micro‑choices (reading frost, testing the prism). Contradictory impulses—seeking proof vs. fearing what answers mean—coexist on the page. The renunciation (shattering the prism) is earned and forecloses a path with felt cost (losing his mother’s relic and research anchor). A slight neatness in his final calm keeps it shy of peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Desire and cost are clear and consistent: she’ll sacrifice herself to send a message. Interiority is economical but specific (pressing amber to her ear; the refusal to weep), though true contradictory impulses are faint. Micro‑choices (cracking the bead, weaving through the night, hanging the tapestry to the wind) align with motive and reveal steel. The renunciation—sender must stay—lands credibly with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The smith’s quiet will and humility read consistently and motivate his descent and barter of the silk. Interiority is shown through tactile choices (inching the silk into the fissure, pressing his palm to stone) rather than explained. However, his internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles against an opposed impulse on the page. The change lands as sharpened resolve rather than a fraught renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motives (being drawn to withheld truth) are clear and embodied through tactile, sense-driven choices. Her key internal pivot—shifting from outward search to inward mapping—reads motivated and character-specific. Contradictory impulses are present but muted; the cost of the final choice is conceptual more than visceral. Relationship pressure is light until the closing exchange, so crucible dynamics are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s restraint, ritual, and gradual surrender to connection read specific and earned (“He wasn’t superstitious, but the glass felt like a promise”). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (burning letters vs. climbing, pocketing the glass vs. returning it). Micro‑choices under pressure—lighting the candle, keeping the glass, writing back—align with his need for safety/meaning. The final renunciation (letting the skiff rot) carries felt cost and closes a path.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s motive—ritual guardianship and bargaining with the storm—is clear and embodied in tactile choices (wick adjustments, steering the beam). Contradictory impulses (weaponized laughter vs. village ambivalence; prophecy she “hadn’t meant to say”) add specificity. The cost is implied rather than deeply felt on the body beyond tired ritual and the wick burning low. Absence of an on‑page counterforce with voice or dialogue limits relational pressure but fits the single‑POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied motivation—his donor heart’s strange rhythm and the wing’s iridescence pull him toward understanding. Micro‑choices (pinning the wing, accepting the map, leaving at dawn, painting in the square) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. reluctance to claim stories as his own) surface in the choice to help others find theirs. The cost is legible in his renunciation—he will “help others find” stories rather than tell his own.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and reverence for broken things read as consistent and character‑particular, with embodied reactions (tears from “pressure,” stinging hands) grounding interiority. His long‑standing question about trees culminates in a credible stance: he becomes a conduit who “passes the sorrow along.” Internal contradiction is mild—he’s steady more than torn—so the felt cost is subtle rather than acute. Still, his choices (to deconstruct, to return, to tend the wall) align cleanly with motive.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive and fear are clear and embodied—the “method…terrified her,” she bleeds to dredge a memory, and she endures throat‑burn to keep singing. The inner contradiction (terror vs. duty) plays in scene and drives action. Complexity is modest, but the micro‑choices under pressure feel earned and specific. The release admission (“It wasn’t just the realm…It was her”) lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—self‑punishing retreat vs. compulsion to face “The Mistake”—are dramatized in concrete choices (pressing the shelf, climbing, opening the book, locking the door). Her empathy is individuated (“weight of every unread book”) and directly constrains action. The relationship beat with Voss’s reflection functions as a crucible, sharpening her values without absolving cost. The final renunciation (locking the door) is earned and forecloses a long‑held identity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motive—refusing the city’s slide into “adjusting”—is clear and enacted through specific micro-choices (pressing crumbs, baking, distributing). The “heuristically gentle” trait is dramatized (mint/thyme, whisper‑lit oven) rather than merely told. Internal contradiction is subtle; she withholds from “the others” yet moves publicly through the city, a tension that could be sharpened for felt cost. Emotional embodiment lands in small gestures more than contested impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s meticulous drive and quiet hunger to extract meaning read specific and embodied (the ledger, the gloved touch, the tremor at the woman’s image). His pivot from measurement to pursuit is seeded (dream margins) and paid by abandoning duty. Internal contradiction—order versus invitation—surfaces credibly under pressure. A touch more friction at the decision point could heighten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motive (avenge/answer the hush that killed her father) is clear and her tactics (studying Veyne’s lies, baiting with routes) reveal competence under pressure. Interiority is textured (“neither fearless nor foolish”) and embodied (the watch fob’s weight, steady hands). The relationship dynamic flips credibly when she laughs and refuses trust. Slight limitation: little visible inner contradiction beyond controlled anger.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s motive (skeptic who measures others’ carried weather) is clear and embodied through the compass ring and sensory-taste method. Her internal contradiction—empirical skeptic versus surrender to becoming weather—surfaces credibly at the needle pointing to her and the ring dissolving. Acceptance comes swiftly with limited resistance, softening the felt cost of identity shift. Still, micro-choices (kneel, press palm, accept the dissolution) align with her worldview and carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief, duty, and stifled artistry create credible, contradictory pressure, and his micro‑choices (descending, using the lock as mnemonic key, abandoning charcoal for color) feel earned. The father’s aphorism and the burden of perfect recall ground motive with cost. Embodied details (charcoal‑stained fingers, knees hitting damp stone) keep emotions concrete. Slight lyric smoothing at peaks nears sentiment, but it doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s bodily aversion to dishonesty is specific and consequential, and his micro-choices (assembling the map, entering the chute, pressing the plate, refusing to open the new fragment) align with that flaw. The interiority is concrete—ink bleeding, breath dampening paper—and the final renunciation (letting words bleed, not reading) feels earned. The emotional cost is legible yet quiet. Minor note: his long history of gilding truths versus “couldn’t lie” invites a hairline tension that the piece mostly harmonizes rather than interrogates.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s motive—coaxing “the sea’s forgotten songs” and preserving wonder—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (metal selection, angle, anticipating the shatter). Interiority is specific and sensory rather than diagnostic. The cost registers as the chosen dissolution of the ice, an Earned Stasis/renunciation scale. A sharper contradictory impulse under pressure is the main missing layer.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—programmed protection versus the destructive necessity of the burn—are embodied and specific (“the static in his chest… the friction of two truths”). Micro-choices (finding and opening the box, striking the match, feeding the fears to the fire, then leaving) reveal a credible values hierarchy. Emotions are grounded in tactile detail rather than labels, and the final renunciation (leaving the dome, not telling the next caretaker) exacts a felt cost. Minor note: the “glitch he couldn’t debug” line edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by subsequent embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motives (skeptical of ghosts, devoted to stories) drive clear micro‑choices—prying the locket, opening the mailbox, reframing the event for the courtyard. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tick‑tick” as heartbeat, dust on fingers). Internal contradiction (skepticism vs. listening faith) is present but gentle, with limited on‑page cost. Secondary pressure from Mrs. Delgado and Old Man Chen functions, though Mira’s change reads more as stance clarification than risky transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lira’s motive—decode and decide whether to keep or release—drives clear micro‑choices (rolling the dice, choosing to dance, opening the seals). Interiority is embodied via the dance as cognition, not abstract reflection. The internal conflict (preservation vs. liberation) is present and paid for by sacrificing the journals. A few thematic assertions verge on told insight, but they’re anchored in action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation is explicit and particular—he wants to retrieve excavated memories of his wife—and his tools and rituals reveal him under pressure. Contradictory impulses (dogged pursuit vs. steady, almost fatalistic professionalism) surface in the chamber and the return to work. Embodied emotion is strong (“air tasted like ozone and old pennies,” the stone’s shifting weight). The endurance/renunciation at the end feels earned and visibly costly (destroyed stone, ash, acceptance).

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and embodied—she means to hush the prophecy by “mapping silence,” using the wing and the brook. Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular (solitude “pressing in like a second skin”). The failure to catch the thread and the choice to accept a partial quiet read as an earned endurance. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle (urgency to “catch it” versus surrender to rest), not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s desire to understand the brownstone is vivid, embodied through touch, sound, and the seal’s heat; his hesitation before signing shows credible contradiction. The relationship with Veyra functions as crucible—status tilts subtly from supplicant to successor. The cost (“you’ll walk away unchanged” as the lie) lands in his transformation. Slight limitation: interiority is elegantly spare, leaving a hair’s breadth less grit under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s motive (refusing sanctioned forgetting) is concrete and intensifies under pressure, and her skeptic-to-believer contradiction operates in scene (trusting the shell while denying “ghosts”). Micro‑choices—burying the shell, continuing as the garden “shudders,” refusing to run, offering the lily—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is sensorial and specific; no therapy‑speak intrudes. A slightly tidier self‑naming at the end (“Now she was a library…”) brushes declarative, but it’s earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forger’s motive arc—seventeen years of treason culminating in an act of forgiveness—feels specific and earned, with embodied choices (not fleeing; using the thorn; guiding the Emperor’s hand). Status dynamics shift convincingly as the Emperor kneels and asks “Teach me,” reconfiguring power through mutual grief. Interiority stays concrete through tactile anchors (ink, thorn dust, ledgers) rather than abstractions. A few aphoristic lines edge toward neatness, but the emotional cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Veyra’s motive is clean and consistent—she descends “to learn why,” confronts Kaelis, and ultimately renounces the echo by discarding the shell. Interiority is embodied through sensory bias (stone, hums, ribs) rather than labels. The Kaelis exchange adds a credible status shift, especially when his plucked thread weaponizes her childhood lullaby. A minor softness remains in how swiftly her recognition (“She understood then”) crystallizes, though the nexus’s rule-set partly justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives—refusing easy comfort to deliver precise, costly truth—are consistent and dramatized through tactile choices (guiding the widow’s hands; producing the locket; submitting herself to the same scrutiny). Interiority is particular and embodied, with contradictions (she “let go” yet clings to “parts worth saving”). The widow applies live pressure and shifts under it. The earned endurance at the end forecloses false solace while carrying felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet rigor and Liora’s skeptical curiosity are distinct and embodied (the grooves on the whisk, the urge to touch the net). Liora’s hesitation—then compliance with the whistle—gives her a credible micro‑turn. The relationship functions as a crucible of transmission without sentimentality. Internal contradiction is modest but present in Liora’s initial doubt versus emergent attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voss’s skepticism-obsession pairing (“didn’t believe in curses… believed in patterns”) cleanly motivates his choice to enter the stillpoint and ultimately to “turn the key.” Interiority is tactile (goggles grit, sap-sticky hands) and specific to his vocation. The pivot from debunker to activator feels earned by the letters and the stillpoint’s “meaning” push. A minor speed-up in his comprehension leap is the only soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive is clear and particular—shift from listener to speaker—rooted in isolation and obsession. Contradictory impulses (seal the crack vs. hurl the receiver) act simultaneously under pressure. Emotions are embodied through tactile, technical actions rather than labels. The change at the end (embracing prophet/hand) is earned, though the personal cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motives (hoarding/repairing the past vs. sharing it) are clear and embodied; his micro‑choices with the jar and the music box reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The girl’s arrival tests him, and his pivot to “keeper of the in‑between” reads earned rather than declared. Emotional textures are specific (the chill, the rusted key, the ache at the dunes’ song). Slight tidiness remains—the resistance to change is brief and the win feels gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Her motives are clear and intensify under pressure—protect, rechannel, pay the cost—and the internal contradiction (“Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay.”) surfaces at the precise hinge. Embodied perception (“molars ache,” “vibrations hum through her gloves”) grounds lyricism. The final endurance and bodily cost (“nerves rewriting themselves”) credibly foreclose a former, safer self. Minor note: we glimpse little beyond vocation, but at this length it serves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lior’s motive—patient, observational revolt—feels specific and governs his choices (listening for the tremor, refusing the knife‑sharpeners). The renunciation of the sanctuary and sister’s ethos provides a credible cost. Internal contradiction (caution vs. desire for change) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressured in‑scene. Embodied perception (ear to strut, frost cracking on cheeks) roots emotion without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s professional lens and father’s credo ground his motives, and his contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. bone‑deep “whispers”) are dramatized rather than told. Micro‑choices under pressure—palming the tiles, reading glyphs, swinging the lantern, choosing the archives—reveal hierarchy of values. The broken lantern is a tangible cost that fits his flaw of privileging cause over immediate safety. Emotional texture stays embodied (“watchfully calm” amid danger) without therapy‑speak.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character‑particular—his decades with prisoners refract every choice, and the clockwork heart exposes his long‑standing avoidance. Contradictory impulses are legible: a habit of swallowed apologies versus the risk of acting now. His decision to mail the first letter in the storm, then keep writing, reads as an earned renunciation of passivity with cost. Minor note: his shift is swift but justified by the tactile making and the inmate’s prior relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pip’s motives and temperament are vivid and consistent; her “yearning algorithm” manifests in concrete micro‑choices (prying out the arrow, lashing it on, leaping again). Embodied stakes (acid hiss, groaning brass ribs) keep her emotions on the page without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is present but light—doubt is transmuted rather than wrestled—but at this length it reads earned. The visible cost (workshop loss, bodily alteration) grounds her endurance as an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s motive—recovering her brother and the erased traces—drives every action with credible urgency and professional competence. Interiority is specific (neural lace, hands shaking, the patch against her chest) but the internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers despite termination risk. The final renunciation (letting the algorithm take her) reads earned and costly. A touch more friction between duty and love would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—shifting from conflict-soother to intervenor—is clear and rooted in his “shadow-laced” nature, with the fragment and the child concretizing that impulse. Interiority is embodied through tactile beats (frost, breath, hum) and a credible ambivalence between seeing and doing. The final step onto the ice forecloses passivity with felt risk, though the personal cost remains largely implied. Minor on‑the‑nose phrasing (“map empathy onto action”) softens the otherwise textured inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lior’s interiority is specific and embodied—“silence…pressed against her eardrums,” the parasol tip in her palm—and her euthanasia plan credibly frames every micro‑choice. The loose grip on reality reads in action (stepping onto the ice “as if it were solid ground”), not label only. Her turn (canceling the appointment) is motivated by the rescue, communal naming, and the engraved initials. The “E.M.” reveal skirts neatness but still aligns with her history and tactile bond with the heirloom.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority with embodied reactions—the brittle snap, the wine, the charcoal—grounds Lior’s motives. Contradictory impulses (loyalty to the vines vs. grief and longing for Mira) act simultaneously and culminate in a credible endurance choice. The renunciation—accepting both her leaving and his staying—lands with felt cost. A few sentiment‑leaning phrasings (“destiny with better trajectories,” “quiet before the storm”) brush cliché, slightly smoothing the edges of his flaw profile.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: Lysan commits to preserving the clearing’s subtle wisdom against the prophet’s fervor. Micro-choices (kneeling, palm to metal, recalling silence, “long enough”) align with a steady, disciplined temperament. Internal contradiction is muted; she rarely wavers, limiting tension from competing impulses. Still, the quiet endurance lands credibly with a felt cost (fatigue, temporary reprieve).

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and particular—she reframes inherited pain through curated images—and her micro‑choices (lingering, selecting light, tucking lavender) align with that aim. Interiority is largely shown through action and sensory bias rather than labels. The internal contradiction is subtle (burden vs. composure) and could press harder under stress. The final stance (case lighter; moving on) feels earned, if low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s obsession, reticence, and tremor‑ridden resolve create a credible arc from isolation to engagement. His micro‑choices—climbing, placing lips to the crystal, privileging silence over words—reveal character under pressure. The cost and contradiction (devotion to dictionaries vs. surrender to listening) are present but could be sharpened. The woman’s arrival tests him without hijacking agency.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s compulsion to “locate” patterns and carry the tape is clear and character‑particular, and the embodied details (chalk spiral, driftwood arrows, the tape’s “hum”) ground his interiority. He holds contradictory impulses—seeking vs. surrender—that collide when the sculpture moves and he chooses renunciation. Micro‑choices under pressure (pressing the tape to metal, snapping the arrows) reveal a value hierarchy with cost. A minor quibble: the “precognitively forgetful” trait lightly skims tactics compared to the rest of his motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s identity as a “sage of broken things” collides persuasively with the choice to stop fixing and move with change. Interiority is specific (fingers on cracked lenses; syncing pulse to brass) and his renunciation carries a felt cost. The contradiction—repairer versus releaser—animates the climax. A few aphoristic lines edge toward abstraction, but they’re earned by the on‑page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives and contradictions are vivid: the shard that “bites” to keep her “decisively kind” grounds her ethic and the pain it costs. Her micro-choices—playing despite the mordant quip, staying through the slowing breath, then relinquishing the shard—track a credible endurance/renunciation arc. The status dynamic with Mrs. Calloway is clean, with subtext in the hymn choice. Slight safety in how smoothly she calibrates emotion prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (find where noon’s shadows go) drives concrete choices—activating the automaton and opening the door. Her “quietly deliberate” temperament is shown in action, not told. Internal contradiction is light; she embraces risk quickly (“Good… Then I won’t be alone.”) which trims some complexity at the peak. Still, her micro‑choices reveal values and cost acceptance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” stance is vivid and consistent; she keeps the needle, offers the tooth, and bargains without panic. Interiority is concrete (“teeth ache,” “cleft in certainty”), and her bone‑setter competence maps credibly to calm under pressure. However, internal contradiction is light and the choice lands with minimal visible cost, softening the crucible. The brother relationship is mostly off‑page, keeping pressure more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motives and worldview are precise and embodied—her refusal of flame and devotion to “kept” light drive every choice. The grief thread (Elias, the grandmother’s “pearl of stillness”) deepens her stance without melodrama. The on‑page renunciation—giving the sea glass to the child—reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (solitude vs. transmission) but present and credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s motives are precise and embodied: seeking hush, reading icicle “language,” gifting moss and ultimately the pendant. Her contradictions—“not hiding” yet retreating—read human and drive action. The relationship functions as crucible without over‑explaining. Only minor: “Brave is a word…” edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by the tactile exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motive (control versus surrender) is clear and particular, with embodied choices: seeking the nexus, pressing the shell, saying “I’m listening,” then renouncing control. Interiority stays concrete (shell, mist, manuscript) rather than abstract. The final renunciation—letting the water take him—reads earned by prior pressure. Slight haste from recognition to surrender keeps it just shy of perfect depth.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s avoidance of song versus comfort with tinkering gives her a credible internal contradiction, and her choice to sing under pressure reads earned. Embodied beats—trembling fingers, palm to soil, throat burning—ground emotion. The change to “keeper of songs” is motivated, though the personal cost skews gentle and neat. A secondary pressure from the absent village is felt but off‑stage.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and embodied: she preserves starlight through ritual patience. Micro‑choices (blood on the plate, deliberate layering, whispered seal) align with her craft and values. The interior turn (“she had not been preserving light. She had been teaching it how to stay.”) is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping pressure modest. Endurance carries a felt cost of isolation and time rather than a contested dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is sharply drawn—craft turned toward salvaging wonder for his daughter—and actions align (reverse‑engineering, testing, leaving it running). Interiority feels particular to a locksmith’s hands and habits, with tactile choices under quiet pressure. Internal contradiction (artisan pragmatism vs. mystical hunger) registers, though the on‑page cost is soft. The relationship pressure is off‑stage, reducing immediate crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s motive (to offload others’ burdens before they dissolve her) is concrete and intensifies under pressure. Embodied interiority is vivid—“weaving their shapes into the hollows of her ribs” and the trembling at the grotto’s pushback. The surrender to being “the loom” reads as a credible renunciation with felt cost. A hair more on her ambivalence before yielding would deepen the contradiction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The widow’s motive—to “contain him” through carving—tracks cleanly to the final renunciation of selling and the acceptance of impermanence. Interiority is concrete and embodied (grain, blade, ache), with a credible contradiction between holding on and learning to let go. The choice to keep the mid-leap lion is earned and carries cost (foregone income, surrender of the “containment” illusion). Minor note: she rarely faces a live interpersonal pressure on the page, keeping the crucible mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s contradictions are vivid and earned: the scavenger who claims she won’t go back yet chooses surrender to the lagoon’s “remembering.” Interiority is concrete (camera wheel pressed to temple; blueprint and bruise echoes), and micro-choices under pressure (raising the wheel like a shield, deciding to jump) align with motives. The ghostly counterpart applies live pressure that exposes values and flaws without tidy resolution. The ending’s endurance choice forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s motive and competence are crisply established and her micro-choices (entering an unsafe site, slotting the sextant, repurposing rather than “fixing”) align with her traits. Interiority is concrete (“she didn’t cheer. She calculated.”), and the engineer’s lens stays consistent. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates, so struggle and felt cost are muted. The renunciation of the spaceport dream for a bridge lands, but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear, embodied interiority with credible contradiction: fear/obedience versus long-suppressed creative impulse. Micro-choices under pressure (not pulling from the crack; arranging the orrery “imperfect, asymmetrical, alive”) reveal values. Motivation coheres across beats and culminates in a felt renunciation of safety. The elders’ off‑page pressure reads real without requiring their presence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives and contradictions are clear: she’s compelled by her father’s ledger yet wary of the lies it holds, steering first into marshes, then choosing renunciation. Interiority is vivid and character‑specific; the sundial and ledger elicit embodied reactions that reveal her values under pressure. The final choice to drop the ledger and keep the sundial reads earned and costly. A slight ease: the aphoristic self‑diagnosis (“They were the scaffolding”) edges toward stated thesis over dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—tending and preserving a hidden archive—is clear and expressed through concrete action (decoding, splicing, whispering the name). Interiority is particular to his craft and patience. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he encounters little friction beyond conditions, so the final commitment carries limited personal cost. Still, his micro-choices reveal a consistent hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motive—to render absences legible—drives tactile choices (pressing the thread to his lips, following it, pocketing the locket). Interiority is particular and embodied (salt scents, trembling decrees) rather than generic. Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal (mourner vs. finder), but his renunciation—delaying return of objects and embracing “elsewhere” as an answer—reads earned. The relationship dynamic with the princess is off‑stage yet informs stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aldric’s motive—resurrecting beauty against an iron world—is concrete, embodied, and persists under pressure; his ritualistic “hypothesizing” creates credible micro‑choices. Contradictory impulses (knowing better than to hope vs. proceeding anyway) are dramatized, not told. The final stance—accepting beauty’s rust‑tanged cost—reads earned. Minor note: the advisors’ pressure is off‑stage, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s contradictions are embodied in tactile choices (sewing the coin, sprinting toward the cry), and her compassion is tested on the page with the boy. Her interiority is precise and unsentimental, anchored by concrete objects and sensations. The visible cost—village scrutiny and the boy’s blood darkening her thread—grounds her stance as Earned Stasis. Minor note: her competence borders on frictionless; a trace more strain under pressure would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora reads as distinct: a “luminous skeptic” whose refusal to mythologize meets a compulsion to act. Contradictory impulses (“Liberating memories isn’t kindness,” yet she proceeds) surface under pressure and drive the choice. Embodied cues—the hum of the box, tactile breadcrumbs—anchor her interior. The cost to her is more conceptual than personal, keeping this just shy of top‑tier.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s motive—to break the cycle and carry light without fire—is clear, persistent, and tested by the gear’s demand for a memory. Embodied interiority (“thrum through her bones,” “breath hitched”) keeps her specific and felt. The choice to surrender her first‑bloom memory lands as a credible, costly micro‑turn that earns the final step. Ambivalence toward her people’s “heresy” charge adds lived contradiction without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior motive is clear and particular—“Could grief be carved?”—with embodied costs (the slipped chisel, the crack, the withheld scream). The father’s spectral coaching creates a credible relational crucible that shifts his tactic from names to hollows. Micro-choices (retracing Liora, unspooling the ribbon, placing the butterfly for trade) reveal values under pressure. Slight neatness in the acceptance arc keeps it just shy of extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motive—atonement through precise, moral tinkering—is vivid and consistent, with micro‑choices (pressing the bob, carving his own name) revealing conflict and cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied (salt‑spray, knife, splinters), and flaws drive action rather than summary. The endurance at the end (continuing to carve) reads as an Earned Stasis with social cost (council outrage, ban). A slight tendency to articulate the insight directly trims the edge of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s blitheness against grave work creates a credible contradiction that drives his calm, exacting choices under pressure (untangling each knot, deciding to tell Hester without accusation). Embodied perception is particular (scent of lavender/river, roots whispering), keeping emotions grounded. His final stance shift—offering truth as seed rather than charge—is earned by prior action. Cost is present but modest, more ethical/relational than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s motive—innovation over prophecy—is clear and consistent, and her hesitation at the fissure shows credible internal pressure. Embodied detail (numb fingers, breath misting) grounds her states. The contradictory impulses (urge to seed possibility vs. fear of overstepping) are present but relatively gentle. The final acceptance reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—to return voice to a silenced city—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (dimming the dial, inviting Lira, prompting her to speak) align under pressure. Interiority is vivid but skews declarative; we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses at peak beats. Lira’s entrance creates a relational crucible that reveals him, though the emotional cost to Elias is more implied than embodied on the page. His disappearance reads as an earned endurance/renunciation but with limited on‑page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motives—crystallizing the fleeting by orchestrated dissolution—are specific and embodied through burning the portrait once “understanding” arrives. The contradiction (artist who destroys once she knows too much) drives credible micro‑choices: scattering powder, accepting the mask’s bite, leaving before morning. Emotional texture stays idiosyncratic (lapis, pearl, unsent letter) rather than generic. The on‑page cost is renunciation of completion/recognition, earned by her ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motives are coherent and pressure-tested: the cog as “counterargument” versus food and safety. Contradictory impulses (“should’ve sold the damned thing” yet builds a vault) operate simultaneously and culminate in an earned renunciation. Embodied detail (calloused fingers, bleeding hands) grounds the stance. Veyra’s brief challenge sharpens status dynamics without hijacking his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and motivated by a hard-earned pedagogy of “subtracting noise.” His micro-choices (placing the rosette, choosing to hum rather than “fix”) reveal grief in tension with care. The four singers register as distinct pressures without stealing focus. A single abstracted line about hatred “unlearning people” skews essayistic but doesn’t break character.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’ motives and contradictions are clear—rule-bound hunger versus empathetic risk—embodied in choices to plant, taste, and serve. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (tasting memories; “context” as palate). The renunciation of chef status is earned via prior beats. Slight softness: external pushback is off-stage, so felt struggle on the page remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s fear that the Last Wonder won’t work pushes a genuine, costly choice: he spends the heirloom to break the city’s rut. The “affliction of truth” informs his interactions (with the girl, the anticipated engineers) and modulates his shame/hope without therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction (duty vs. fear; routine vs. risk) stays embodied in tactile moves—ladder, box, seed. A minor limit: secondary pressure is light, so struggle feels brief once he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Liora’s motive—to understand why some houses feel alive—drives concrete micro‑choices (placing the shard, arranging objects, pressing the key, finally leaving the shard). Interiority is sensorial and particular, not generic. The renunciation at the end carries a modest but legible cost. Internal contradiction is light (curiosity vs. restraint) and could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Two-character crucible is clear: Liora’s protective, reformist impulse meets the intruder’s mission and doubt. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, fogged helmet, knees hitting mosaic) and contradiction is active (duty to poison vs. surrender to truth). The turn—drop the ampoule, press the seam, remove the helmet—feels motivated by Liora’s “incisively kind” pressure. Pace of conversion is swift but justified by telepathy working “where the cracks already were.”

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motives are specific and consistent—“capture the texture of a missed opportunity,” not reclaim it—and her choices (testing the dice; refusing the door) arise from that stance. Contradictory impulses are live at the door, and the renunciation carries felt cost (leaving the smooth die, keeping the chip). Interiority is concrete and object‑grounded; the mathematician’s cast of mind reads through action. A touch of aphoristic self‑summation softens the edge but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motives and contradictions are precise: a sleepless artist steadies himself through ritual, chasing proof that kindness endures. Micro‑choices (hovering over the glyph meaning “to rouse/forgive,” choosing to inscribe the child’s laughter, finally writing “dawn”) reveal values under pressure. Embodied details—lapis, jasmine, the brush’s memory—keep emotion grounded. Slightly insulated from overt jeopardy, but the endurance and relinquishment to sleep feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s motive to preserve the city’s fading arts is clear and intensifies into the decisive, costly choice to shatter the heirloom lens. Interiority is embodied and specific (hands shaking; the child’s loaf as tactile spur). The contradictory impulse—revering history vs. destroying its relic—reads credibly at the peak. Minor limitation: her internal hesitation could tighten once more under the waterfall scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s obsession and intent (“counter‑clockwise clockmaker… to unmake [time]”) motivate every action, and his embodied tension (“breath came fast… pulse a counterpoint”) lands. He wavers briefly over the stones as warning or invitation, but once committed, internal contradiction largely recedes. Micro‑choices (winding backward, pressing the yoyo into the cog, stepping onto the stone) reveal values under pressure. A touch more on the cost to self beyond transcendence would deepen his change.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is clear and pressured: reclaiming self by “unbosoming” the double while weaponizing fear. Contradictory impulses land in-scene (“I’m not here to fight” as tactical lie). Emotions are embodied through tactile objects (raven clasp, filmstrip heart), though interior cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Slight mythic competence smooths struggle, but choices track.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leeward’s motive—to dub the storm and turn resistance into rhythm—is specific and enacted in micro-choices (what he strikes, leaning into the sway). Interiority is concrete and embodied (salt-stiff mallet, orchard tilt) with a flicker of contradiction (knowledge of prior harm vs. thrill-seeking). The emotional turn from restlessness-as-fear to restlessness-as-anticipation reads earned. Slight thinness in visible cost to him personally keeps it below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elyas’s motive—decoding the shells and confronting the watchers—drives every action, and his restraint (“didn’t flinch”) fits “quietly driven.” His micro-choices (whistle sequences, pressing forehead to the crack, stepping forward without looking back) reveal priorities under pressure. The interiority is precise but not deeply contradictory; he reads more assured than conflicted. The visible cost is a chosen renunciation: leaving the city as the gate screams and his whistle turns to dust.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive is crisp and consistent—rescue truth, not chase glory—and his calm tactics under pressure read as character-specific. The pulse-versus-composure beat gives him contradiction without melodrama. Interiority is selective but effective, though internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized. Father Callahan functions as a credible counterforce with legible status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motives are coherent and particular: a surveyor compelled to preserve murmurs in stone, dramatized by answering the found note and later sacrificing his heirloom. The “stoically sensitive” tension is embodied (precision vs ache), though live, in‑scene pressure is gentle rather than acute. The wife/archive backstory sharpens his flaw without slipping into therapy‑speak. The trade of the inkwell is a credible cost that crystallizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motive—tracing honest origins—drives every micro‑choice, from lamp readjustment to opening the pressure lock and choosing secrecy at the end. Interiority is precise and embodied, though internal contradiction is understated; he is almost too calm under pressure. The final Earned Stasis (keeping the chamber undisclosed) feels consistent and paid for by relinquishing recognition and communal validation. A touch more friction or cost-on-the-body would deepen the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and character‑particular: a grieving artisan seeking her daughter’s voice through the basilica. Interiority is embodied via tactile work (gems, glass, pain) and the folding/unfolding grief metaphor. Agency is present at key turns (pressing the gem, reaching into glass, choosing to let go). A touch more on contradictory impulse at the decision to surrender could elevate this to elite.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s motive—reclaiming agency by “hunting” potential rather than undoing the past—is coherent and builds into a risky, specific choice at the console. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnt sugar and copper,” the geode’s heat), with credible contradiction between yearning to intervene and choosing only to witness. Micro-choices (stealing the hard drive, keying the frequency despite the warning) reveal a clear value hierarchy. The final renunciation—remembering rather than fixing—feels earned and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s motive—seeing “gaps in the world” and craving belonging—drives concrete choices (steal the chip, then surrender ownership to the larger revelation). Interiority is specific and embodied (“fingers twitched,” “chest tightened”) with a credible renunciation at the end (she doesn’t keep the piece, doesn’t give her name). The pilgrim applies light, relevant pressure without stealing focus. The final hand‑taking lands as an earned, vulnerable shift rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s guilt and professional self-betrayal are concrete, embodied, and drive his micro-choices (palming the driftwood, listening for the “liar,” throwing the watch hand). The interior contradiction—he forges pasts for others but withholds his own truth—builds credibly to the decision to go. The renunciation (tossing the watch hand) forecloses a long-held avoidance with felt cost. Slight melodramatic touches don’t undermine the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and layered—principled neutrality, personal inheritance, and a willingness to pay a private price. His micro‑choices (producing the drawer pull, reframing terms, reading Kaelis’s hesitation) reveal a specific moral calculus. Kaelis’s ruthlessness softens credibly through the nephew and childhood memory. The visible cost—surrendering his father’s object—earns the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is specific and embodied: the compass’s warmth, the poles as “unanswered questions,” and the letters with smudged ink make his conflict tactile. Contradictory impulses act on the page—needle vs. horizon, leaving vs. reading—culminating in a renunciation that costs him a core identity (navigator). No therapy‑speak or unearned clarity; his acceptance remains bruised and partial. Minor safety in the bartender beat (low external pressure) prevents an even higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liam’s interior conflict—neural scrubbing versus the “hollow behind his ribs”—is embodied and tested through concrete choices (entering the fissure, throwing the baseball, facing the man in the park). His contradictions persist under pressure and drive action rather than tidy epiphany. The final chess move reads as earned renunciation and reorientation with felt cost (the tunnel collapses; the ball is relinquished). Slight ding for the lake’s didactic line edging into thesis voice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s grief-driven motive (“reforge” her brother) is clear and escalates through concrete micro‑choices—vanilla, then nutmeg, then pulling at absence. Contradictory impulses are dramatized: she denies belief yet enacts ritual, recoils at the “wrong” return yet tries again. The final acceptance (“She was the bridge”) feels earned by prior pressure and costs her the pursuit of reversal. Minor reliance on myth exposition doesn’t blunt her embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is clean and particular—she seeks fractures to reach a vanished brother—and her embodied ritual (ink, saucer, moss) reveals a defined psyche under pressure. The internal contradiction (devotion to riddles vs. the cost of hoarding grief) surfaces in the “repent for time” turn. The final renunciation (letting go) is earned by prior tactically driven beats. Slight dock for one explicit prompt—“You have to repent”—that edges toward told insight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lien’s motive—to mend the sealed dimension through stubborn, compassionate craft—is unwavering and dramatized through embodied micro‑choices (exhale after failure, “pick up the needle,” push on “Now”). Interiority is specific (fear of light, not dark) and tied to tactile acts (needle, breath‑thread). The visible cost—losing the Eulogy and letting her stitches unravel—earns the change from “last human” to “first.” Slightly lyric distance keeps contradiction (dread vs. hope) just shy of maximal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elira’s motives—giving light away despite destitution and seeking “the texture of transformation”—are clear and embodied through concrete choices (the cave detour, the sacrificial hurling of vials, stepping onto the pumice raft). Interiority is specific and sensory rather than labeled. The internal conflict is modest (beach vs. cave pull) but sufficient at this length. The final renunciation reads earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s motive (the ledgers and the “disappeared”) is concrete and drives each micro‑choice. His competence and calm inventiveness are embodied in tactile action (picks, tension wrench, timed reset). Internal contradiction is light—he’s steady more than conflicted—so the emotional cost reads as risk rather than a torn psyche. The closing renunciation (“vanished into the dawn”) lands as earned stasis, though the felt personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear motive (to read and set the sacred patterns) and embodied pressures (bleeding fingers, dust in bones) ground Liora. The curse and vocation produce a credible burden/compulsion dynamic, though contradictory impulses remain implied more than dramatized. Agency is present in the choice to “harness” and “push.” A felt endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (ink bleeding, ribs “X‑rayed by grief”), and his contradictory impulses—hoarding the poem vs. letting the storm edit it—culminate in a credible renunciation. The censored‑poet identity consistently informs his micro‑choices. Slightly low external pressure, but his internal pressure reads specific, not generic. The final refusal forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct, competent adversaries with readable motives (answers vs destinations) and status play that shifts into partnership. Interiority is sparing but effective—Elias’s pulse quicken and the heron image show embodied pressure. Micro-choices (slapping the card, tracing light, choosing the notch) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is mostly conceptual (defying the Council), not deeply felt emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear, embodied interior conflict between the itch to molt/leave and the compulsion to mend/build, revealed through concrete micro‑choices (the lie to Maren, adding the violet, beginning to write). The relationship dynamic adds pressure without melodrama. Slight softness in the on‑page cost keeps it from the top band, as guards and departure remain mostly latent. Distinct voices register briefly but credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s motives are clear and embodied—years of wound clocks and mapped compasses culminate in a bold tactic—but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers once the plan begins. The small, flinty exchange (“You’re late.” / “So are you.”) lands character and history efficiently. Micro‑choices (splicing the reel, walking while playing, not looking back) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. A touch more friction under pressure would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motive—guarding communal memory at personal cost—is clear and intensifies under the monsoon clock. Fear vs duty operates simultaneously (“She pocketed the seed anyway”) and actions align with her vocation. Embodied reactions (“teeth stained violet,” “clutching her temples”) keep emotion concrete. The only limit is that relational pressure is mostly off‑stage, so the crucible is inward rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motives are clear and embodied—grief, regret, and a craftsman’s patience shape every choice. His micro‑choices (tracing the lace, humming, planting the compass) align with a slow, tactile temperament under pressure. The internal contradiction—holding on vs. letting the tide move through him—registers with credible cost. A slight neatness in the final calm edges toward tidy, but it’s earned by the prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Elias’s internal shift from a researcher of cosmic collapse to a witness of terrestrial decay feeling both profound and earned. The motivation is clear and consistent, and his final choice to take a sabbatical is a credible, costly outcome of his internal journey. His interiority is conveyed with specific, poetic language ("decay as a kind of poetry") that avoids cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s interiority is concrete and specific to her identity as a glass artist, successfully linking her perceptual habits to her current crisis. The internal conflict between her shattered artistic self and the emerging, purposeful survivor is well-dramatized through her interaction with the ledger and the frost. The final choice to walk on is earned by the preceding journey of loss and discovery, representing a credible, costly renunciation of her past methods. The motivation is clear and intensifies effectively, making the character arc compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in her trauma as a survivor and her mentor's legacy. Her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied details like her "uneven bursts" of breath and "trembling fingers." The arc from passive victim of silence to an active agent who will "play the storm" is compelling and earned, with a clear cost paid on the page—her hands going from "trembling" to "steady" is a masterful touch.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Elias's motivation is grounded in his profession and his core belief in "rest." The story effectively dramatizes his "quiet kind" of stubbornness, turning it into the engine for the plot. The internal conflict, while subtle, is made clear in the moment he "should have tossed it into the abyss" but instead follows the call, and the final act of writing his own name in the ledger is a powerful, earned character choice that lands with significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's identity as a "reluctant leader" is masterfully shown through action rather than statement, grounding his motivations in a consistent internal conflict between the need for anonymity and the demands of his community. The transition from secret provider to public symbol is earned through escalating pressure, particularly his reaction to the arbor's destruction. The small, embodied detail of clutching the bell "like a dying man’s last breath" is a moment of perfect emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving him from a state of seeking to one of keeping. The character change is earned through the climactic revelation, and his internal state is well-embodied, particularly in the trembling hands and patterned breath. While strong, the moment of epiphany ("Elias understood then that healing wasn’t mending...") verges on diagnostic self-awareness rather than a purely felt, in-the-moment realization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s motivation to “unbuild” the maze is established immediately and gives her a specific, intellectual lens that makes her vulnerable. The shift from intellectual curiosity about “texture” to a visceral need to survive is dramatized effectively. Her final choice to reject the maze’s core and instead design the “edges” is a powerful, earned change rooted in her harrowing experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s characterization as a “patiently strategic” operative is superb, demonstrated through her methodical puzzle-solving and the clever, non-violent dispatching of the guard. The motivation is clear and compelling, and her interiority is grounded in concrete action. The final touch of the arrow’s “recklessness” adds a welcome layer of complexity, preventing her from being a one-note archetype of patience. A slight deduction is for the final internal reflections, which, while poetic, occasionally veer into articulating the story’s thesis too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias's motivation is deeply rooted and his interiority is rendered with exceptional, embodied specificity (a sound that is "a bruise of indigo"). The central conflict between his precise professional self and his messy internal quest is clear and compelling. The final choice to wade into the rising tide is an earned renunciation, a powerful culmination of his internal journey with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is established with compelling specificity—an obsession with "illuminated moments"—and is skillfully tested and transformed by the climax. Her core trait of being "quietly savvy" is demonstrated through action, not just stated, making her choice to break the lock credible. The final transformation from a collector of moments to becoming one herself is a powerful, earned extension of her initial desire.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and deeply integrated with her craft as a glassblower, a profession that provides a rich, non-obvious metaphorical framework for her internal state. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through her interactions with the logbook and her memories, showing contradictory impulses. The final choice is earned, a direct result of her reinterpreting her father's legacy through the lens of her own hard-won philosophy: "how the most durable pieces were those allowed to cool in their own time."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s motivation to reclaim her erased identity is sharp and compelling. Her internal conflict, balancing professional fearlessness with a deep-seated phobia, is well-drawn and pays off in the final image. The protagonist’s shift from victim to agent, spurred by the girl’s challenge (“You gonna let him win?”), feels earned, though the final realization about weakness as a strength verges on being overly articulated rather than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Eldrin's motivation—a mild obsession with mapping the night through collected silences—is both unique and consistently dramatized. His interiority is concrete, filtered through his specific fixation. The final choice to release the booklet is an earned renunciation, a resolution of the conflict between hoarding (recording) and understanding (erasure), and the cost is the dissolution of his prior identity and life's work. The character is a perfect vessel for the story's conceptual weight, and his final action feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, rooting a high-concept internal conflict in concrete micro-choices. The motivation—the haunting question—is elegantly established and drives every action. The shift from "remarkably composed" analysis to the final act of "reverence" and self-recognition is an earned and resonant change, showing a clear before/after state with a felt cost of leaving behind a simpler existence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a specific past habit ("scribbling cryptic doodles... from mistrust") that is directly reactivated by the inciting incident. Her internal journey from cryptic self-protection to clear, empathetic expression is earned and demonstrated through action, not just summary. The final choice to create and leave more tickets feels like a natural, resonant extension of her transformation, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a visible change in her core impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The vine dresser’s motivation is rooted in a deeply felt, specific philosophy, and her internal state is beautifully rendered through embodied actions like polishing the cracked marbles. Her quiet endurance and the "mended deception" create a compelling history that charges the present-moment confrontation, making her final, gentle victory feel profound and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through his single-minded focus on the nexus, ignoring the AI’s warnings. His interiority is specific and earned, moving from a mechanic's tactile memory to a theorist's insight. The core contradiction—a humble mechanic harboring a universe-altering theory—is compelling and resolved in the quiet, confident final beats. The final action, resting his hand on the lever, perfectly embodies an earned stasis that forecloses doubt with quiet satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s motivation is consistently rooted in a specific, character-particular desire: to find meaning not in music, but in the patterns of decay. This internal contradiction is well-established and compelling. The transition from passive observer to active participant is earned through the ghost's escalating communication, culminating in a final choice—to play—that reconfigures his relationship with silence and his art. The story perfectly embodies the principle of change earned through prior causality, with the final duet foreclosing his former state of solitary seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, built on a powerful internal contradiction between her external role as “unshakable” and her embodied private anxiety. The motivation for her final, world-ending choice is earned through the fever-induced clarity, her long-held philosophical friction with her job, and her connection to the smudged illustration. Her final action is a credible, costly resolution to the core tension of living in the margins versus embracing a catastrophic truth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal conflict between honed skepticism and inherited dread is dramatized through his physical interactions with the setting, particularly his appraisal of the valve wheel. The shift from scavenger to witness is earned by the climax, and the final choice to carry the truth—foreclosing the path of denial—lands with palpable cost. His contradictory impulses are active throughout, culminating in a credible and resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional, realizing the keeper not as a person with a conventional arc but as a consciousness dissolving into a state of witness. Motivation is crystalline and the final Earned Stasis, with the cost of their personhood, is fully earned. The keeper’s interiority is conveyed through a distinct perceptual filter that perfectly serves the story's accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his childhood memory and professional ethos. His interiority is specific, particularly the "tuning fork in his pocket" metaphor. The final epiphany is earned through action, but the articulation of his new understanding feels slightly too neat and diagnostic, avoiding the messier contradictions of a genuine crisis-born insight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias Vey’s motivation is singular and powerfully dramatized. His interiority is conveyed with concrete, embodied action rather than summary, as when his fingers trace the weaver’s hesitation in the tapestry. The final earned smile marks a significant, credible shift from a passive archivist to an active participant in the world’s new state, foreclosing the path of mere mourning with a felt cost—the acceptance of imbalance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    Chen’s characterization is superb, established through his specific, paradoxical worldview ("He didn’t believe in fate. He believed in *open secrets*"). His motivation is clear and his agency is demonstrated through calm, deliberate action under pressure, not panic. The final re-framing of his escape as "transposing life into a new key" is an earned moment of internal resolution that lands with the weight of his lost twenty years.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The priest’s motivation is strikingly clear and his actions are consistent, creating a compelling thematic vessel. However, the characterization narrowly misses the highest tier because his internal state reads as resolute rather than conflicted; there is little sense of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. While his sacrifice demonstrates commitment, the lack of an on-page struggle or moment of doubt makes him feel more like a function of the concept than a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    Li Wei's characterization is exceptional, driven by a potent and beautifully rendered internal conflict between his prescribed, passive role and his innate artistic agency. His motivation, rooted in a specific and embodied homesickness ("not a place but a *when*"), feels deeply earned. The final choice to "conduct" is a powerful, credible culmination of his reflections, turning a lifetime of repressed artistry into a decisive act of self-reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear internal conflict embodied in the concept of weightlessness and the splintering selves. The motivation is direct but earned by the mythic tone. The final change is powerfully realized when gravity finally settles on him, providing a physical anchor for the psychological resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's internal conflict between his past identity and his present numbness is rendered with visceral specificity through the "filament of hush." The final dream, where numbness transforms from a wall into a door, is a masterfully earned change, demonstrating a profound internal reconfiguration without resorting to simplistic epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s character is established with remarkable efficiency through his precise actions and perceptions. The internal conflict between disciplined observation and curiosity is tangible, culminating in an earned final stance of fearful resolve. While the line describing his nature "warring with the discipline" verges on summary, the surrounding actions provide more than enough dramatization to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority rendered through specific, embodied details like grief being a "slow erosion" that "hollowed out his ribs." The internal conflict between aromatic caution and the need for release is palpable, culminating in a choice that is both surprising and earned. The final renunciation is entirely credible due to the powerful reframing of his grief, demonstrating a deep and consistent character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a consistent internal landscape focused on texture and pattern rather than conventional goals. His motivation—to understand rather than to achieve—is clear and compelling. The final choice to create the ladder is an earned, resonant action that demonstrates a change in his stance, moving from passive observer to active participant in creating new patterns. The line about being "ethically playful" adds color but feels slightly disconnected from the core, solemn actions of the scene, a minor point in an otherwise masterful portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through embodied action and potent memory. Her motivation to preserve beauty in a ruined world is clear and deeply felt, not just stated. The arrival of the child creates a crucible that tests her commitment to solitude, and her choice to play a new, collaborative song is an earned change, showing a shift from preserving the past to creating a future. The interior conflict between honoring memory and embracing a new connection is handled with subtlety and power.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s characterization is superb, built on the potent contradiction between her professional detachment and a profound, costly empathy. The motivation to give the client the truth he needs, rather than the counterfeit he paid for, is earned by the sensory details of the scene. Her final choice to take on the ache herself ("fusing insight with empathy") feels inevitable and powerful, creating a change with a clearly legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is well-established, rooted in his mother's legacy and his own professional eye for "undervalued" people. His internal conflict—the shift from a "calculus of profit" to "something softer"—is demonstrated through his actions. The final choice to form a partnership is a credible culmination of his weeks of observation and the catalytic discovery of the locket's owner, making the change feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Reed’s characterization is exceptional, driven by a clear and potent motivation for belonging that is embodied in her craft. Her defining trait, "boldly sympathetic," is demonstrated through the pivotal choice to organize the search, creating a powerful link between character and plot. The final change in her understanding is earned through action, and the subtle mirroring of Syl’s reed-mark scars with her own carvings provides a resonant, non-verbal bond that deepens both characters efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elspeth's motivation as an illustrator trying to preserve a disappearing natural world is clear, concrete, and drives the entire narrative. Her internal conflict is shown through her precise actions under pressure, particularly the final choice to sacrifice the trapped light in the jar. The secondary character—the boy—is an effective foil, applying immediate, archetypal pressure that sharpens Elspeth's choices and clarifies the stakes of her world.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    The conjurer’s motivation—to map and solve his grief as if it were an equation—is established immediately and sustained with profound consistency. His internal conflict between the desire for precision and the reality of ambiguity is not merely stated but embodied in his every action, from tracing the mosaic to placing the glass eyes. The final shift to acceptance is an earned, resonant change, foreclosing the path of magical resurrection with the felt cost of embracing the unsolvable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is both clear and deeply felt, stemming from a core contradiction between his ingrained secrecy and a sudden, powerful need to connect. The transition from observer to actor is earned through meticulous setup—the outage, his long observation of the woman, the personal weight of the cached items. His final choice to step into the light is the culmination of a perfectly rendered internal struggle, with the cost of his 17-year isolation made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation is sharp and sustained: she *needs* to know. The internal conflict between scientific control and intuitive surrender is dramatized effectively, culminating in an earned change. The final actions—pulling the stakes and offering the leaf—are potent externalizations of her internal shift, showing a character remade by her discovery with a clear, felt cost to her old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is established with powerful economy, rooted in his post-war weariness and painter's obsession. The internal conflict—between cynical exhaustion and a stubborn flicker of curiosity—is dramatized perfectly in the moment he finds the stairs ("He should’ve turned back. But..."). His final change feels earned, a shift from wrestling with the world to collaborating with it, with the cost being the surrender of his familiar despair.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from seeking the grand to inhabiting the mundane is compelling. The change is earned through the on-page encounter, and her final choice to leave the pearl has a palpable cost—the renunciation of a lifelong ambition. The line "her hands empty, her heart full" perfectly captures the contradictory impulses and the earned resolution, fulfilling the 9+ test of a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his character is revealed through his actions, particularly the micro-choice to listen to the valve rather than blow it. The final decision to toss the valve is an earned renunciation of an old role, foreclosing a path with felt cost. Interiority occasionally verges on thematic summary ("The valve wasn’t just an object; it was a pause..."), slightly abstracting emotion that could be more fully embodied in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s obsession with mapping is not just a profession but a precisely rendered coping mechanism for grief, a motivation that is revealed with causal force. The internal conflict between the desire for precision and the chaos of loss is embodied in his actions, culminating in a final choice—to accept uncertainty—that is both surprising and inevitable. The shift from a man who charts paths to a man who follows questions is a profound and earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s central conflict between scientific skepticism and profound grief is well-established and compelling. Her motivation to transcribe the tile as a "rebellion against silence" is a strong, character-particular choice. The transformation into a "cartographer of echoes" feels earned, though the final beats of interiority verge on summarizing her own arc with diagnostic clarity ("kindness, she’d learned..."), slightly flattening the embodied emotion of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lysander's motivation—ennui born of immortality—is established with poetic efficiency and directly fuels the story's single, decisive action. His interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the line "the awareness of a man realizing he had been holding his breath for millennia." The final change is profound and earned by the preceding internal conflict between merely leaving things behind and truly letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s motivation to find a “fair trade” is established immediately and provides a powerful internal conflict against her father's legacy. Her shift from a solitary “counter” to a collaborator is earned through the pressure applied by the girl. The final change, embracing the new math of “them,” is a decisive and costly character reconfiguration, satisfying the contradictory impulses and visible cost required for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The stationer's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific; his desire to collect "textures" instead of truths is a compelling and unique character engine. His interiority is consistently embodied, particularly in the moment his pulse quickens upon unearthing Elara Voss's story. The final choice to begin a new history demonstrates an earned renunciation of the waking world, solidifying his identity with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-embodied. His transition from a passive, ghost-like observer to an active curator of forgotten histories is earned through his micro-choices—collecting the label, listening to stories, leaving offerings. The internal conflict between his fading personal memory and the vivid texture of collected memories provides a compelling engine for his final, decisive act of renunciation, which lands with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s core contradiction—the myth buster secretly praying for a miracle—is established efficiently and fuels the entire narrative. The transformation from a debunker to a "myth keeper" is earned through his interaction with the key objects, culminating in a choice that redefines his identity with a clear, felt cost. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly in the description of his "gloomy cheerfulness."

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—her dual allegiance—is effectively dramatized through her actions and internal monologue. The contradiction between her mainland training and her love for Lumina drives the narrative compellingly. The final choice feels earned, though the line “The mainland had taught her to build walls; Lumina had taught her to build bridges” verges on overly explicit thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply felt. The internal conflict between defiance and resignation is beautifully rendered through small, concrete actions—the theft of a sand grain, the clicking camera shutter. The line "Men of the space age didn’t cry..." is a minor misstep into generalization, slightly abstracting an otherwise embodied and particular emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias Vey’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a powerful blend of interiority and action. His motivation—an artisan’s intrinsic need to mend—is clear and compelling, driving the plot without needing elaborate justification. His emotions are embodied through his unique sensory experience, particularly in how he perceives the flawed ship not with eyes, but as a discordant “hum” and a vibration, making his internal state concrete and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lena’s characterization is exceptional in its economy and precision. The core trait—an atlas editor whose job is to "find where things began"—is not just a label; it perfectly motivates her investigation and her ultimate, calm acceptance of a cosmic role. Her quiet confidence, shown in actions like lighting the stove with steady hands and not flinching at the supernatural, makes her final choice feel inevitable and earned, a culmination of her life's purpose rather than a sudden shift. The character's internal state and external actions are perfectly aligned, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a final choice that is both a profound change and a logical endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tuner is a compelling archetype, but his characterization lacks the specific, contradictory interiority needed for the highest tier. His motivation is clear and consistent. However, the final thought, "Balance... was a thing you kept," feels less like an earned, in-the-moment realization and more like an authorial thesis statement delivered through the character, slightly flattening his voice at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s motivation is powerfully established and her internal conflict between guilt and the instinct for self-preservation is dramatized effectively, particularly in the moment she "unsnarled the vial’s silver chain with deliberate slowness." The final shift to acceptance is earned through the climax. However, the closing thoughts ("Time, she decided, was not something to outrun...") feel slightly too articulated, a diagnostic summary that slightly lessens the raw, embodied nature of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s motivation is crystalline and potent, rooted directly in his identity as the “boy who cried wolf’s son.” The internal conflict between his inherited legacy of lies and his quest for a foundational truth is beautifully dramatized, not just stated. The final lie to the warden—“Nothing… Just the light”—is a masterstroke, as it’s also the first real truth he can offer, showing an earned change. His competence in navigating this liminal space feels earned by a lifetime of living with “voices that weren’t there.”

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora's motivation is potent and mythic, rooted in a specific, high-stakes promise that drives every action. Her character is revealed through costly effort ("excavation") rather than exposition, making her final sacrificial choice feel both inevitable and earned. The keeper serves as an excellent, world-weary foil, grounding the ethereal conflict in a handful of perfectly pitched lines.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's characterization is deeply integrated and compelling. His contradictory impulses—a history of mending physical decay ("frayed edges") versus an innate "haunting optimism"—are not just stated but dramatized in his climactic choice to reach for the winged figure without fear. The final transformation is earned by this established internal tension, with the physical and emotional cost ("bones aching... heart light") making his new purpose feel weighty and real.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is expertly drawn from the contradiction between his skepticism (“didn’t believe in miracles”) and his deeply ingrained belief in tangible connection (“he believed in roots”). This internal conflict is not merely stated but embodied in his methodical, purposeful actions. The final moment of “raw and disbelieving” laughter captures this duality perfectly, making his subsequent choice to continue deeper feel earned and complex rather than a simple conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's characterization is strong and consistent, with motivation rooted in a well-dramatized professional philosophy. The moment of hesitation at the mailbox provides a concrete instance of internal conflict, showing the weight of her work. The final choice to mail the letter and return to her clipboard demonstrates an Earned Stasis that feels true to her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is crystalline, and his final act of renunciation is earned with the ultimate, visible cost. His defining trait—disguising wisdom as foolishness—is demonstrated through past action ("deliberate errors") which gives his final, overt defiance more weight. The only minor slip is the line, "But stories stop *everything*," which verges on a direct thematic statement rather than embodied character insight, slightly thinning the subtext at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is deeply felt and rooted in a specific, unique form of mediumship—listening for the living who can't speak. The internal conflict between her habit of lingering "in the moment before deciding" and the need for resolution is the story's engine. The final choice is earned through the preceding internal struggle and embodied actions, making her shift from stasis to forward motion credible and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s characterization is exceptional, rooted in embodied emotion and a clear, contradictory motivation. Her internal state—the ache of old wounds versus the instinct to translate others’ pain—is dramatized effectively through her interaction with the objects. The line, “*He wasn’t trying to hide them... He was holding them*,” reveals her core competence and worldview in a single, powerful action, fulfilling the promise of her backstory without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation is consistently rooted in a desire to reclaim lost beauty, and this is shown through action rather than just stated. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, especially in the moments she handles the fragment and the film; her trembling hands feel earned. The final choice to share the vision is a natural culmination of her established traits, and her acceptance of the moment's transience provides a satisfying, non-sentimental closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's motivation to escape certainty is established early and provides a strong engine for her arc. Her transformation from a preserver to a creator is earned through the cyclical trials in the garden. The final choice to paint a door is a potent culmination of her internal conflict, and the detail of the nickel acquiring *her* smirk provides a concrete, satisfying image of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot effectively. While his core defiance is well-established through action, the "charming rogue" quality is more asserted than dramatized. The brief moment of embodied emotion—his stomach tightening at the warning—is effective but underdeveloped, leaving his interiority slightly thin compared to the vividness of the external world and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The poet’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in the potent concept of alchemizing pain. Her interiority is concrete and mythic, avoiding cliché. The single-mindedness of her purpose, while powerful, slightly lessens the tension of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene, keeping the score just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora’s motivation is crystal clear and her transition from preserver to destroyer is earned through visceral, embodied pressure. The internal conflict between her life's work and the horrifying reality she unleashes is dramatized, not summarized. The final choice to break the chime is a powerful renunciation of her core identity, with the cost made tangible in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established as “penance,” giving her immediate depth. Her defining trait, “carefully reckless,” is not merely stated but dramatized in the climax, where she makes an intuitive leap only after a period of intense scholarly calculation. The final emotional shift—trusting her own voice—is earned by the preceding act of restoration, making for a compelling and coherent character arc. This meets the 9+ standard with its dramatization of contradictory impulses resolving with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity, and her final earned steadiness—her hands "not trembling at all"—provides a powerful contrast to the machinist's remembered tremor. The character arc is clear and compelling. The thematic summary in the machinist's letter ("weakness is just compassion in disguise") verges on being overly explicit, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias's internal conflict between trauma-induced caution and the hope for reconnection is embodied in his physical actions—hands that tremble except when handling his birds, flinching at sounds. The micro-choice to send the pigeon is a potent externalization of his internal shift. The interaction with Madame Holloway provides sharp, concise pressure, with her line "They're the only thing you've let yourself keep" landing with devastating accuracy and raising the stakes of his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is intensely clear and his progression from frantic father to willing acolyte is earned within the story's mystical framework. His interiority is conveyed through sharp, embodied perceptions ("the way the wind carried no trace of her laughter"), avoiding cliché. The final choice to ask "teach me the codes" rather than rescue Liora represents a profound character change, a renunciation of his old worldview with the clear, felt cost of leaving it behind.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation—to find a "frequency" of belonging—is established with poetic precision and drives every action. Her interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché; the shift from observing patterns alone to experiencing connection is embodied in the line where the water's weight becomes an "embrace, not a burial." This internal change is earned through the scene's pressure. Kael is a well-executed catalyst, his presence forcing a choice in Elara between observation and participation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recollectionist serves her role effectively, but her interiority is more conceptual than personal. Her motivation is clear but lacks a deeper, contradictory layer that would make the final epiphany feel more struggled for and less like an elegant answer to a puzzle. The shift to understanding is driven by an external event (the cut) rather than a complex internal negotiation of contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lior's motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and dramatized through his every action. His interiority is not just stated but embodied in a unique perceptual mode—seeing the world as an equation to be solved through music. The final earned shift in understanding, from the chessmaster's "unnamed order" to his own "order hiding," demonstrates a meaningful change with the palpable cost of intellectual and artistic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a self-imposed penance that gives her climactic act of creation both weight and desperation. Interiority is rendered with concrete, poetic force (e.g., "memory was a kind of drowning"), avoiding abstraction. The final choice to "fledge" is earned through the preceding ritual and the backstory of her exile, representing a costly but necessary transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's motivation is deeply rooted in his relationship with his daughter and his profession, making his ritualistic actions feel both inevitable and poignant. His interiority is rendered with concrete, sensory detail, particularly in how he interprets the ripples as a "silent language." The final action—reaching for the next stone—perfectly captures a state of Earned Stasis, showing a quiet commitment to his practice as a way of enduring loss, with the cost felt in the lingering memory of his daughter's absence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s characterization is exceptional, with interiority that is both concrete and lyrical. The central conflict between his desire to connect and his fear of causing harm is embodied perfectly in his relationship with the landscape and the porcelain box. The final choice is a deeply earned renunciation, releasing a treasured object to reclaim a relationship, demonstrating a profound and believable character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's characterization as a "logical dreamer" is rendered with exceptional consistency and depth. Her motivation to find "new equations for hope" is not just stated but embodied in her actions—from scribbling on the walls to arranging fractal patterns. The internal conflict between logic and wonder is dramatized in scene, culminating in an earned epiphany that feels like a synthesis rather than a simple choice. The change she undergoes is profound and credibly earned by the story’s events.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is clear and deepens organically from professional curiosity to a personal quest. The internal conflict between the detached cartographer and the involved son is dramatized through his choice to burn the door, an action that aligns perfectly with his established character. The final change, where he shifts from mapping to living, is earned by the preceding events and carries a palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora's character is realized through a powerful central contradiction: her ability to create possibilities for others is contingent on her renunciation of her own. This is not merely stated but dramatized in the pivotal, earned action of letting the mirror slip before it can show her face. The cost of her professionalism is made tangible, fulfilling the 9+ test for contradictory impulses culminating in a choice with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Veyra's practiced calm versus her internal tremor and Kael's journey from cynical despair to human vulnerability are rendered with precision and subtext. The pivotal beat, where Veyra uses Kael's own past words against him, is a masterful stroke that makes his eventual choice feel both difficult and inevitable. The contradictory impulses are fully dramatized on the page, earning the final, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The characterization of Elias as a man of profound contradiction is superb. His interiority is concrete and his actions align with a compelling internal conflict. The motivation for the final act, however, hinges on the epiphany "enough," which reads as a slightly too-convenient conceptual label for a complex internal shift, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora's motivation is established immediately and executed with poetic consistency. The core character concept—a "chaste courtesan" embodying restraint to enact a rebellion of radical empathy—is potent and well-realized. The final transformation is earned through the ritualistic choices she makes on the page, with the cost of that change made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, with a core internal conflict between his precise, controlled artistry and the messy human truths he tries to manipulate. His interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding cliché; the contradiction "Elias wasn’t serene by nature, but his hands were" perfectly captures his struggle. The final choice to "let the puppets stumble" is a deeply earned evolution, a renunciation of control that demonstrates a credible change with a clear felt cost—the forfeiture of his disarming perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization of Lior as an "esoteric realist" is masterful, shown rather than told through his specific, ritualistic actions. His motivation—"to honor what the world forgot"—is established early and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the entire narrative. The final act of gathering new materials is not a change but a deepening of character, an Earned Stasis that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira's motivation is clear and potent, rooted in a specific past failure. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly the "lost wax casting" metaphor which perfectly captures her sense of loss. The final change is earned, but the concluding self-anointed title, "*the one who let the lost be found*," feels slightly too articulated, a diagnostic label that steps back from the embodied experience that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lior’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict between a past choice and a fated path is well-dramatized through the film reel. The character's shift from questioning to acceptance is earned through a series of revelations. The final choice to embrace the storm is a powerful culmination of her arc, sacrificing certainty for transcendence with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Qishti's characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal contradiction between his empirical discipline and the dawning mystery. His frugal habits directly motivate the inciting incident, and his scholarly nature drives the plot. The final change is earned and precisely calibrated, articulated in the shift from kneeling "in worship" to kneeling "in recognition"—a perfect synthesis of his old and new self.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior’s motivation to shed resentment is established early and tested throughout the scene. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized through the dialogue with the memory of Kael, with contradictory impulses—holding on versus letting go—operating simultaneously. The final choice to re-engage with the past feels earned, and the change from silent resentment to open listening is rendered with a credible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation evolves credibly from escapism to reunion, driven by a well-established internal conflict between being “grounded” and his brother’s “flight.” The final choice to let go is a costly and earned resolution to this central tension, rooted in his established traits of grief and deep fraternal connection. The character arc is complete and resonant within the story's compact frame.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.4)
    The mender’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a potent internal conflict between prideful duty and aching love. Their motivation is clear and deepens with each remembered detail. The final actions—asking the question, binding the ribbon, eating the apple—represent a profound and earned character change, moving from rigid adherence to a vow to a living, imperfect connection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    Veyra’s motivation—a hunger for knowledge—is sharp and consistent, compelling her toward the story’s central choice. Her shift from inquirer to steward is earned economically through the vision of her predecessors, a strong causal link for this length. The final action of eating the pistachio and finding her own face on the shell is a brilliant, embodied beat that cements her acceptance of a new role with a felt cost—becoming part of a cycle rather than its master.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias Veyne is a superb creation for this length: his motivation (intellectual avarice) is clear, and his defining flaw (hubris in believing he can master absences) is dramatized, not stated. The interiority is sharp, especially the line "grief was a renewable resource," which perfectly captures his chillingly transactional worldview. The final beat, where he weeps for a name he cannot remember, is a powerful and earned reversal that pays off his character arc with devastating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and compelling, and her final choice to expand her mission is a strong character beat. The interiority is concrete, especially the "blissfully aberrant" scales as proof. The characterization narrowly misses the highest tier only because the shift from personal rescue to communal savior, while thematically sound, happens so swiftly it feels more like an epiphany than a choice born from dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, her core trait of being "warmly methodical" creating a perfect baseline against which the story’s impossible events can force a transformation. Her motivation to translate confusion into clarity is tested and ultimately redefined, not just fulfilled. The internal conflict between her training (*artifact*) and instinct (*fable*) is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice to "merge" that is both surprising and inevitable, carrying the clear conceptual cost of her objective identity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eldrin's motivation for preservation is clear and consistent, driving his actions without being static. The shift from preservationist to participant in a new harmony is earned and powerful. The character's internal state is conveyed through concrete, embodied actions, like unspooling tension from his bones, which avoids abstract emotional labels and makes his final acceptance credible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation is crystalline: a blend of duty, deep-seated loneliness, and a search for meaning in a broken world. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, particular details, such as the “quiet in her own ribs.” The arc from a child’s hope (bringing her mother back) to an adult’s complex understanding (seeing the shape of the past) is earned and lands with the weight of the story’s accumulated textures.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization of Summer-Quill is strong and consistent, with a clearly articulated motivation driving the scene. Her core trait of being "preemptively nostalgic" provides a solid foundation for her life's work and internal conflict. The final change is earned, but the moment of epiphany is articulated with slightly too much diagnostic clarity ("Identity wasn’t something you sculpted..."), which momentarily lessens the feeling of a lived, embodied realization in favor of a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's motivation is clear and compelling, expressed through her actions and internal chants rather than simple exposition. Her character is revealed through her specific way of perceiving the world—filtering darkness through senses attuned to her craft. The final change, where she becomes "heavier" along with the world, is an earned and nuanced evolution from defiant wanderer to one who has accepted the weight of creating change.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.6)
    The chronicler's interiority is exceptionally well-rendered through her concrete, sensory engagement with the world. Her motivation is consistent and her final micro-choice—giving away the cicada—is a perfectly earned expression of her character, foreclosing her own access to its comfort in an act of profound empathy. The contradictory impulses of seeking solitude for insight versus connecting with the fisherman's grief are resolved in a single, powerful gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The child's motivation is powerfully established in the opening, contrasting the father's "safety" with the felt experience of "shrank." The character's arc from passive endurance to active self-liberation is earned through a series of specific, escalating choices. The father is an effective crucible, his fear-based love creating the pressure needed for the child's transformation. The final choice feels both inevitable and devastating, a perfect culmination of the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is superb, established through his craft rather than exposition. His motivation to curate silence is concrete and dramatized through his every action with the dial and vial. The passenger serves her purpose well, her grief embodied in subtle gestures that provide the conflict for Elias’s skills, culminating in the resonant image of her unclenched shoulders. The final choice—Elias returning to his work—is an earned stasis that reinforces his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elsin's motivation is clear and her competence as a "wisely adventurous" lore keeper is well-demonstrated through action. The shift from seeking ascension to enabling renunciation is an earned change, driven by new knowledge. Her final choice to walk away carries a visible cost, solidifying her character arc. A deeper, more contradictory internal conflict prior to the final discovery could have elevated this further.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lior's motivation is exceptionally clear and dramatized through his contradictory impulses—the desire for the "clean" silence of isolation versus the instinct to fulfill his lineage's purpose. The internal conflict is embodied in his physical interactions with the sanctuary, particularly the doorknocker. The final choice feels earned, flowing directly from the re-contextualization of his past actions, with the cost of final severance made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lina's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in her past trauma with the *Luminous Ascent* pyramid scheme. Her internal conflict between cynical survivalism and a desire for agency is dramatized through her choices, particularly the decision that "mischief... had kept her alive." The final, costly choice to break the bolt's concept is a perfectly earned culmination of this character arc, making her transformation from victim to variable feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias’s motivation is sharp and his core internal conflict—between inherited rationalism and a desperate hope for intuition—drives the entire plot. The transformation from "dynasty ender" to "the first to cross" is earned through a series of specific, character-driven micro-choices. The final acceptance of his thirty years of "failure" as a necessary preparation gives the change a palpable cost and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.4)
    The knight's motivation is powerfully established through his history of silence and embodied in his reactions to the setting and the program. The internal conflict between his rigid refusal and the undeniable summons is dramatized with concrete physical tells ("His breath hitched," "fingers twitched"). The final change is earned and its cost is made visceral in the single line about his smile: "it hurt like holy fire."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in his own history within the system, making his choices feel both personal and inevitable. The internal conflict between his ingrained resignation and the "quiet ache" for connection is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lena's characterization is superb, established through action and potent interiority rather than exposition. Her defining contradiction—the "harmless archivist" who is a determined rebel—is earned and consistent. The transition from "She wasn't a hero" to the decisive action with the ledger is a powerful, earned change. Her motivation feels deeply rooted, and the final choice to leave the key is a perfect culmination of her arc, renouncing ownership for the sake of the cause.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.6)
    The saxophonist's motivation is both clear and complex, evolving from a simple goal—hushing a prophecy—to a profound acceptance of a perpetual, defining duty. This internal conflict is exquisitely rendered, culminating in an Earned Stasis that feels both tragic and transcendent. The character's interiority is flawlessly filtered through his relationship with sound and silence, making his final choice to return to the grotto not just believable, but inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's characterization is consistent and serves the mythic tone well. Her motivation to understand the unfolding mystery is clear and her actions follow logically from her established role as a careful, reverent worker. The final transformation feels earned. However, her interiority lacks significant conflict or contradiction; she moves from curiosity to acceptance with little internal friction, which slightly flattens her arc from exceptional to merely very good.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.4)
    The tinkerer’s motivation is anchored early and with distinction: not to make things work, but because “broken things... held secrets.” His internal conflict between the compulsion to fix and the futility of it is the story's engine. The final transformation into someone who can “let it go” is earned through a series of concrete discoveries, making the shift from obsessive control to befriending uncertainty feel both profound and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora's motivation, a potent mix of professional rivalry and suppressed admiration, is rendered with nuanced interiority. The story excels at showing her internal conflict through micro-choices, such as her hands remaining steady while her ribs tremble.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, with her motivation and interiority established through concrete, specific details like the "tuning fork" vibration of souls. Her "modest fearlessness" is shown, not just told, in her lack of surprise. The final choice to tell a joke is a perfect, earned culmination of her dawning understanding of this particular soul's need, representing a profound shift in her function from collector to healer.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with exceptional clarity and depth. The transformation from a trauma-haunted survivor to someone capable of a new, deliberate perception is earned through embodied experience, not intellectual summary. The final choice—to count silences—is a perfect, character-particular expression of his changed state, foreclosing the path of seeking a formulaic solution with palpable cost and release.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lior’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority conveyed through a specific, embodied perceptual signature rather than summary. Her transformation from someone seeking a fixed point to someone who navigates the currents of time feels earned and profound. The final choice to step forward is a crystallization of her arc, accepting the cost of her old self for a new, greater purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is expertly established through his professional skepticism and unique skills.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a duty-bound preserver to a willing agent of dissolution. The final choice is earned through the story's central act, and the cost is made devastatingly clear. The only minor reservation is that the pivotal epiphany—"the system wasn’t the world. It was him"—is delivered as a direct statement, slightly lessening the impact of an otherwise brilliantly executed internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias Veyra’s motivation is exceptionally clear, driven by the internal conflict between his revolutionary past and his poetic desire for revision. His final choice feels earned, and the change from carrying a "weight in his chest" to feeling lighter is a credible emotional arc. The antagonist, Dr. Taelis, serves her purpose as a foil but lacks depth, functioning more as a trigger for the climax than a fully realized character, which slightly limits the relational pressure.

    Characterization is very strong, with a clear and consistent interiority rooted in the protagonist’s artistic sensibility. His motivation evolves organically from survival to a deeper need for connection.

    Liora’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively framing her obsession. The internal journey from a driven, seeking artist to a still, receptive listener constitutes an earned change.

    Liora’s motivation is powerfully established through backstory (mother’s fate) and a concrete goal (save the seeds), compelling her actions throughout. Interiority is excellent, with embodied emotion (“pulse stuttered”) and a central, active contradiction: using memory of the past to secure a future.

Tomas's conversion is earned through quiet observation, making the transfer of legacy feel both credible and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is a superb fusion of professional drive and personal history, embodied by the amber fly.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coachman's motivation is established with spare, potent backstory and dramatized through a consistent, ritualistic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation that is both deeply felt and consistently expressed through action. Elias’s internal conflict between clinging to memory and achieving resolution is masterfully externalized in his art and his final choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.7)
    Exceptional characterization. The central conflict is masterfully externalized through the dialogue between Elias’s two selves, showcasing contradictory impulses in-scene. Motivation is both clear and complex—the desire to escape the prison of being a “chronicler” is earned by the weight of beautifully rendered internal states like “feral nostalgia.” The final choice to encourage the burning of the scroll is a perfectly executed and costly act of self-renunciation that forecloses his old path.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.4)

The final choice to embrace the question is a perfectly earned change, rooted in the contradictions established from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena’s characterization is superb, established with concise precision from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is executed with rare economy and depth. Elias and Liora are defined through their shared, ritualistic actions and their complementary skills—his silent weaving, her disruptive gaze.

The final moment where the camera's weight changes provides a superb piece of embodied emotional cost, externalizing their internal state without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional, anchored by the potent internal contradiction of an archivist-arsonist.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and his actions are consistent with his role as a protector and strategist. However, his characterization lacks a significant internal conflict or a visible moment of doubt; he moves from problem to hyper-competent magical solution with little friction, which slightly flattens his arc. While his role is fulfilled effectively, a glimpse of struggle or a contradictory impulse would have elevated the characterization from archetypal to deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established through his weariness and the instinctual pull of the sea. His interiority is concrete, especially the ache “to *detach* from the weight of the land.” The transformation is earned, but the final paragraph slightly over-articulates his emotional state after the powerful action has already made it clear, slightly softening an otherwise sharp character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena's motivation is clear and embodied in her craft. The shift from making a wilted lily—a sealed reliquary for grief—to a crane meant to hold light is a powerful, earned character choice. The final extension to teaching others feels slightly accelerated, but her core internal conflict and its resolution are compelling and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling contradiction of a mystic’s tools applied with an engineer’s curiosity.

The final shift in his mission—from reading for clients to reading for the culture itself—is an earned and resonant evolution, a perfect culmination of his internal state meeting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to "avoid the patterns" is not just stated but actively dramatized, particularly in the moment she confronts the vision of her future self and dismisses it: "Fear was just another pattern." This micro-choice perfectly embodies her internal conflict and methodology. The final transformation is earned through this discipline, with the faded veil serving as a potent, visible cost for her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally well-grounded in her core trait as a "dusk noticer," making her sensitivity to the shadow and her "half-empty" state feel inevitable rather than convenient. Her final, sacrificial choice is a powerful and earned action that resolves both her internal state and the external conflict. The contradictory impulses—curiosity versus the curator's warning, and the desire to help versus self-preservation—act implicitly to charge her final decision with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation for atonement is deeply rooted in his past actions and is compellingly rendered through his internal conflict. His contradictory impulses—the muscle memory of the grift versus the genuine desire to heal—are shown, not just told. The final shift to continue his work is earned through on-page action, though the concluding line about the "only con left" verges on being slightly too diagnostic, a minor blemish on an otherwise superb portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and evolves under pressure, moving from a professional desire for closure to a deeply personal renunciation of it. Her interiority is rendered with specific, concrete details (e.g., reading coffee rings as "concentric confessions"), avoiding cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation as a "thief of echoes" is compelling and sustained. The internal conflict between her hunt for a tangible message and her ultimate acceptance of an intangible one is beautifully rendered. Her final shift from seeking to accepting is earned through the story's central discovery, with the cost being the final embrace of loss. A minor cliché ("gift, or curse") is outweighed by the otherwise specific and powerful interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation as a "moonstruck dreamer" is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict—the "creativity she’d trapped in her ribs"—is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory choices in the scene. Her transformation feels more like an anointing than a victory won through difficult internal struggle. The final change is profound, but her agency is primarily receptive, which slightly lessens the impact of her earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hollow’s transformation from a dreamless automaton to a purposeful guardian is earned and compelling. The character’s initial emptiness is established economically through his name and lack of dreams, making his final choice to protect the spark feel significant.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal state, particularly his numb arm and rusted voice, masterfully mirrors the fortress’s enforced silence.

The internal conflict between his ingrained duty and a nascent need for truth is palpable and resolved with a cost that feels both personal and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    Veythas's motivation is exceptionally well-realized, moving from a 300-year stasis to decisive action. The internal conflict—duty versus the personal cost of sacrificing Lirien's name—is the story's powerful core, and the choice feels both inevitable and costly. The pretender's final line, *"I never wanted it,"* brilliantly recontextualizes Veythas's struggle, making his act one of mercy as much as justice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena’s characterization is superb, driven by a compelling and consistent motivation rooted in familial lore and professional observation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, realizing Liora's internal conflict through embodied action rather than summary. The tension between her father's contradictory legacies—the bounty hunter's pragmatism and the gardener's patience—is the story's engine.

The transformation of inherited tools from violence to continuity is particularly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied. The shift from a desire to erase guilt to an acceptance of bearing witness is an earned, powerful character change, crystallized in the final action of picking up a fresh needle. The internal conflict is dramatized, not summarized, particularly in the relived memory where her hands shake "not from fear but from the knowledge of what she would do next," a line of devastating self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior's characterization is strong and consistent. His motivation to listen rather than scrub is established early and drives the narrative. The interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly the line defining whimsy as the face of a man who'd "stopped fearing the lack of answers."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias is a compelling, well-realized character whose contradictory impulses—gentleness and radical defiance—are dramatized consistently through his micro-choices.

A truly memorable and complete character arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lena’s core contradiction—the “affectionate skeptic”—is established with deft specificity and pays off beautifully in her final choice. The decision to *paint* a door rather than simply follow Mira is a perfect synthesis of her artistic nature and her lingering need for control and a pathway, demonstrating a change earned through the climax with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lior’s motivation is clear and evolves credibly from rebellion to a profound sense of purpose. The interiority is specific and revealed through a unique perceptual lens (the sensory mapping), grounding the story's high concept in a believable consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his role as the hourglass turner. His interiority is conveyed through deliberate action rather than summary, and his competence is balanced by the weight of his burden. The final choice feels earned, a direct result of his meticulous investigation, foreclosing the path of passive acceptance of fate. The characterization is strong, though it serves the story's conceptual core so perfectly that he occasionally feels more like an archetypal guardian than a person with contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lena’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the beautifully rendered internal conflict between “prudence” and “daring.” This contradiction is not merely stated but dramatized in her physical hesitation before opening the pillbox. Her motivation for accepting the mission—"For the girl she’d been”—provides a resonant and psychologically complex foundation for the climax, elevating the story beyond a simple spy narrative. Her trauma is skillfully embodied through physical details like her burns and mismatched eye, making her history a constant, visible pressure.

    The coachman's characterization is exceptional, defined by a patient, near-mystical competence. His motivation, rooted in the decade-old promise, is made tangible and compelling through his focused inaction.

    The potter's characterization is exceptional, defined by a specific, embodied philosophy—"phototropic to kindness."

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's face-blindness is not a gimmick but the core of his unique perceptual world and motivation, creating a specific and compelling interiority. The conflict between his methodical nature and the "empathy he’d buried" is dramatized effectively, culminating in the earned shift where his "methodical heart [is] a little less still." His final choice to walk toward the sound of the cough is a perfect, subtle embodiment of his renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity. The character arc from seeking an answer to accepting the stillness is earned through his interaction with the setting and his memories. His final shift feels credible, though the last two sentences slightly abstract the change rather than leaving it fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and his internal conflict is well-defined, rooted in his professional identity as a solitary chronicler. The transformation into a participant is earned through the story's central revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation is intensely clear, and his interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied weight rather than summary. The central contradiction—a finder seeking a truth he may not be able to bear—is expertly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s motivation is viscerally embodied in her scars, which serve as a map of past failures and a compass for present action. The characterization is exceptional because her internal state (regret, determination) is externalized through her physical interaction with the world—pressing her forehead to bark, her hand to a scarred wrist. The encounter with her future self provides a crucible moment that recontextualizes her struggle not as failure, but as necessary preparation, earning the final shift in her stance with a tangible cost felt through past suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elias’s motivation, rooted in professional obsession and profound grief, is clear and compelling. His interiority is rendered with precision, particularly the brilliant conceptualization of the spirit as a "hypothesis"—a shape his grief had pressed into the empty air," which perfectly aligns with his intellectual nature. The final change is earned, moving from a search for an external answer to an internal re-calibration of perception, with the felt cost being the acceptance of this new, bittersweet reality.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, with Elias’s internal conflict embodied through his interactions with objects—the map, the bellows. His motivation is clear and deepened by well-integrated backstory.

The internal shift from viewing her pulse as a “countdown” to a “rhythm” is a masterfully executed, on-page change earned through the story's central event. Her interiority is specific and avoids cliché, particularly the description of being “lucidly watchful,” which is a trait, not just a label. The story perfectly earns its final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.7)
    Maren's motivation is sophisticated and brilliantly executed; her rejection of "peace" for "the source" provides a complex and compelling drive. The internal conflict between achieved forgiveness and its lingering "hollow" is embodied, not summarized. Her final actions are a direct, earned consequence of her transformation, showcasing a character arc that is both profound and believable within the story's mythic framework.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s internal conflict is compelling and his transformation is earned. However, the moment of epiphany contains diagnostic label-speak ("I didn’t know how to welcome nuance into certainty"), which summarizes the character's flaw rather than purely dramatizing it. This slightly flattens the interiority at a key moment, preventing the characterization from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional, with Elias’s motivation rooted in a coherent, if paradoxical, philosophy. His interiority is rendered with concrete sensory detail, and the internal conflict between the need to teach and the danger of revelation is palpable. The final choice feels earned, and the change from sixty-three to sixty-two provides a tangible cost, embodying the struggle. The grandfather's dialogue, while pivotal, borders on being slightly too aphoristic, which is the only element keeping this from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. The skimmer’s motivation is rooted in a deep, consistent reverence for his lineage, and his interiority is conveyed through beautifully embodied sensations rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlin’s motivation is clear and evolves satisfyingly from penance to self-acceptance. His interiority is specific, especially the concept of "lingering luminance," which grounds his unique perspective. The final choice to walk away is earned by the revelatory experience at the spire, demonstrating a change with the felt cost of rejecting institutional validation. The keeper character, while effective, borders on a convenient archetype, a minor point holding this back from a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)

The character's internal journey from observation to participation is rendered with concrete, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora’s motivation is crystalline, rooted in her core trait of finding patterns in chaos. The internal journey from interpreting a warning to accepting an invitation is a powerful, earned shift. Her defining obsession, viewed as "madness" by others, is convincingly portrayed as the very quality needed for this moment, and her final choice is paid for with the dissolution of her form—a significant and legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.5)
    The reaper's characterization is exceptional, rooted in a single, powerful contradiction: a being hollowed out to carry others' grief who then chooses to create more of it. His motivation to give shape to formless dread is established early and poetically, driving the narrative with a sense of mythic inevitability. The final moments, where he accepts regret but has "no room left to carry it," and hears the first scream as "a good sound," perfectly crystallize his tragic and resolute nature without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb. Elias’s core contradiction—a “lukewarm mage” with world-changing ambition—is established economically and fuels the entire narrative.

The change from desperate hope to weary, clear-eyed resolve is subtle but powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias’s motivation is deeply rooted in his history and manifests in concrete, contradictory actions—patrolling as a warden versus feeding the reservoir as a son. The internal conflict is dramatized, not summarized, culminating in an earned transformation. The final choice to create a bridge of new memories rather than just mourn the old ones feels both surprising and inevitable, with the cost of letting go of his physical relics felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptionally strong, with the alchemist’s core conflict between rigor and sentimentality driving the narrative. This contradiction is embodied in her actions—a ritual combining precise components (flint, crystal) with an unquantifiable goal (wonder). The cost of her transformation—losing the "girl who had once pressed flowers into books"—is made tangible and gives the final choice significant weight. The brief statement "The alchemist was secretly sentimental" is a minor instance of telling in an otherwise masterfully shown portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently rooted in her role as a “watcher,” and her actions are convincingly driven by her mentor’s legacy and the high stakes. The interiority is strong, particularly the embodiment of memory in the parachute buckle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated with the central conceit.

The internal conflict is externalized perfectly, and his final choice feels both desperate and inevitable, earning the powerful emotional shift from a "numb half-life" to the "crushing, glorious *all* of it." Veyra serves as a sharp, effective catalyst, applying pressure without extraneous exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his philosophy of the “stretch” of a mind. The story successfully dramatizes his internal state through his micro-choices, like brewing chamomile before opening the envelope, which establishes his patient nature.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira's characterization is exceptional, with a clear, specific worldview ("Fear was a luxury for people who believed in permanent things") that perfectly motivates her actions.

The character is fully integrated with the story's premise, making her the ideal guide for this transient world.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, culminating in the line, “I’m proving they were never ours to begin with,” which feels earned by his actions.

Her internal state is well-embodied through her interaction with the chain link, and her micro-choices in teaching Kael reveal a coherent philosophy. Kael serves as effective secondary pressure, and the final change feels earned, though the epiphany in the last two lines is slightly too articulated, verging on summary rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, driven by a professional duty that is later revealed to be deeply personal. The internal conflict between his methodical job and his "reckless" curiosity is dramatized effectively, compelling the story forward. The final change is profound and earned, with the line "He was a man who listened too closely" gaining immense weight at the closure, demonstrating a character whose core trait is both his flaw and his salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivation is compelling, shifting credibly from a tangible goal (cables) to an intangible, obsessive purpose. The internal conflict between fear and curiosity is well-dramatized in the choice to cross the phase seam. The final articulation of his motive—"to stand by the unremembered"—is powerful, though it borders on being slightly too declarative for a story that otherwise excels at showing over telling.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lena’s motivation is exceptionally clear and deeply rooted in her existential crisis over the death certificate. Her interiority is rendered through specific, embodied actions—tracing the screen, rubbing the porcelain shard, tracking her own pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)

The emotional progression from bitter obsession to a kind of transcendent surrender is both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The violinist’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority sometimes defaults to thematic summary rather than specific, contradictory thought. The line "...for the thing inside her own chest that had also been waiting to break free" feels more like a diagnostic label than an embodied, in-the-moment realization. While her external change is earned, the character herself feels more like a perfect vessel for the theme than a complex individual with genuine flaws or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias's characterization is superb, anchored by the poignant contradiction of being "respectfully rebellious." His motivation evolves from duty-bound curiosity to a profound sense of purpose, a change earned through the story's central event.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lior's characterization is exceptional, with his defining trait—silence—serving as both limitation and, ultimately, the medium for his profound expression.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.5)
    The librarian's motivation is established with poetic precision and immediately tested.

Her final choice to whisper "Stay" is a perfectly earned renunciation, revealing a deep hierarchy of values where witnessing life is more important than possessing it.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is superb, realized through a blend of embodied action and resonant backstory. The locksmith's core contradiction—her rule ("Never open what you cannot close") versus her intuitive compulsion—is tested and resolved in a single, fluid motion. The brief reflection on her mother’s locket is a masterclass in economy, grounding her immense skill in a particular, personal wound without stalling momentum. The final shift from a master of locks to a facilitator of choice is an earned, profound change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is rooted in his profession and a deeply personal, unfolding loss. The internal conflict—chasing a past he may have willingly discarded—is sophisticated and resolved in a powerful choice. The final shift from a victim of memory loss to a defiant equal is earned by the story’s causal chain, fulfilling the contradictory impulses in a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly in the mentor-apprentice dynamic. Elspeth's "combative tenderness" is brilliantly realized through action and subtext, not just stated. Kael's micro-arc from doubt to action is earned and credible. A minor deduction is for the dropped trait: Elspeth "walked backwards when nervous," but this doesn't manifest during the climax, which feels like a missed opportunity to embody her internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s motivation is exceptional, rooted in a specific and compelling internal contradiction: the hunger to "shape the unseen" versus the eventual understanding that wonder must be passed through, not hoarded. The shift from a shaper of trees to one who lets himself be shaped is an earned and profound character change. The characterization is particular and embodied, avoiding all stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction between his trade as a "restorer" and his ultimate act of letting something remain broken. His motivation is rooted in a deep, accumulated understanding rather than a sudden epiphany. The final image of his broken smile fitting him perfectly provides a resonant and earned character closure, fulfilling the 9+ test with a choice that has a visible, world-altering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is seamlessly integrated with her professional identity as a "map framer," making her methodical approach feel both credible and compelling. Her interiority is sharp and specific, avoiding cliché; the shift from methodical investigator to someone possessing a profound, unprovable certainty is earned. The final state of "quiet certainty" represents a meaningful character change, foreclosing her previous, purely empirical worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora's characterization is exceptional. Her "quietly analytic" nature is not just stated but demonstrated through meticulous observation, providing a perfect counterpoint to the metaphysical mystery she encounters. The motivation, rooted in a career of deciphering final moments and sharpened by the personal grief for her sister, feels both earned and profound, making her final renunciation of answers a powerful and resonant choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in the legacy of his grandmother and his intrinsic nature as one who "hears what others don't." The final choice is a potent renunciation, a crystallization of his values where he prioritizes self-preservation over the overwhelming need of the other. The internal conflict between his duty to translate silence and the horrifying cost of this specific translation is embodied perfectly in the climax, meeting the 9+ test for contradictory impulses leading to an earned, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.6)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal arc from quiet desperation to earned joy is rendered with precision. The change is catalyzed by her "warmly inquisitive" nature, which is shown, not just told, through her methodical investigation of the diary. The final choice to "begin to climb" is a perfect culmination of her internal shift, with the cost—accepting the cold—made explicit and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in the unique practice of "categorizing clouds by emotion." His internal conflict between grief and acceptance is dramatized through potent micro-choices, culminating in the surrender of "letting himself fall." The final earned change, from observer to participant ("a thread in the spool"), is rendered with convincing, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The artist’s motivation—a lifetime of chasing an impossible precision—is made visceral and concrete. The internal conflict between her muscle memory and her conceptual block is beautifully rendered, and her final shift to acceptance is earned through the climax, culminating in the powerful choice to paint "nothing," a portrait that finally feels true.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistently drives the plot from the inciting incident to the resolution. The status dynamic with Captain Veyra shifts effectively, providing a solid interpersonal arc. However, Liora's primary trait of "curiosity" faces very little internal contradiction or costly trade-offs, making the character arc feel more like a smooth validation of competence than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.6)
    The locksmith's motivation is potent and elegantly established through backstory that directly fuels her present actions. Her internal state is masterfully embodied in concrete, non-clichéd details like her breath curling "like old ink" and fingers that "ached for the rhythm of repair." The final shift from being a woman "out of step" to becoming "the key" is an earned and resonant transformation, fulfilling the 9+ test of a final choice earned by prior causality with a visible cost (three years of her life).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and her arc from seeker to builder is well-earned. Kael is a compelling, consistent character. The story relies on a slight "tell" by stating Liora believed Kael immediately, which slightly flattens the initial tension, but the core character work is very strong and the final choice is earned with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally well-grounded in his thirty-year duty, and the shift is catalyzed by a deeply personal memory, making his final choice feel both surprising and inevitable. The internal conflict is embodied in his shaking hands versus his decisive final action, fulfilling the story's emotional arc with a cost that is clearly articulated and felt. The characterization is flawless for this scope, earning its final moment of serene fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional for this length. Her motivation shifts from burdened refusal to purposeful action, a change earned through the catalyst of the girl. The internal conflict is clear in the contradiction between her history of “refusing pleas” and her precise, careful action of providing aid. The final choice to continue her work is a powerful moment of renunciation and acceptance, showing a fully realized internal arc with the felt cost of continued isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation and interiority are rendered with exceptional specificity, rooted in his profession as a polymer chemist. The internal conflict between building/control and dissolution/flow is compelling and well-dramatized. The characterization is slightly weakened by the girl's appearance, whose voice being the "exact pitch" of his sister's veers into sentimentality, and the over-articulated thematic summary in his notebook feels less like an authentic thought and more like an authorial pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora's motivation is clear and consistent, but she functions more as a fixed philosophical anchor than a character undergoing change. Her core belief is demonstrated and confirmed, not tested by any internal conflict or meaningful opposition. The final beat's self-assurance—"She already knew the answer"—cements her as static, which, while coherent, lacks the dynamic quality of a character truly shaped by the events of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's motivation is rooted in a specific, embodied magical realism that drives every action. The internal conflict between his professional duty and his secret, burdensome calling is palpable. The final choice feels earned, and his transformation from burdened to "clean" is shown through a concrete sensory shift, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's characterization is exceptional, blending her professional role (librarian, choir director) with her function as the town's social conduit. Her motivation is clear and her actions, particularly having a twin weight as a failsafe, reveal a deep, practical wisdom. Elias’s shift from weary antagonist to partner is earned by his palpable exhaustion, making his acceptance of Liora's radical empathy a credible turning point rather than a sentimental convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in professional failure and personal loss, which compellingly drives her high-stakes self-experimentation. The internal conflict between her "precise" engineering mind and the "chaotic" entangled reality she seeks is dramatized effectively through her actions. The final transformation from "archeologist of abandoned dreams" to "cartographer of the entangled dark" is an earned and resonant character change, showing a profound shift in identity paid for with her old self.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysara’s motivation is sharp and compelling, anchored effectively by her brother’s memory. Her defining trait, "prism-mind," is a strong conceptual entry point, but it functions more as a static perceptual ability than a source of internal conflict that complicates her choices under pressure. The transformation from "seeker" to "key" provides an earned and satisfying arc, but her interiority in the peak moment of crisis could show more contradictory impulses beyond the reactive lunge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his interiority is rendered through a unique sensory filter ("symphonically minded") that feels authentic and sustained. Actions, perceptions, and the final resonant choice to leave the insulator are seamlessly integrated. The characterization is specific, embodied, and drives the entire emotional arc with no false notes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation, rooted in his exile, is exceptionally clear and provides a strong engine for his internal conflict. The contradiction between his fear of playing and his desire to find meaning is dramatized effectively, particularly in the moment he hesitates over the pawn. The final action—giving the worry stone to the girl—is a potent, earned culmination of his character arc, demonstrating a shift from solitary intellectualism to shared vulnerability and connection. The change is beautifully embodied in the simple, final line about the weight in his chest.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between passive observation and active engagement is well-dramatized. The final choice is earned by the preceding events, particularly the device reacting to his own silence. The arc from collecting silences to repairing them is strong, though the final scene with the first customer feels slightly too neat, softening the ambiguity and cost of his new path.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation—a "hunger to cultivate serenity within motion"—is both clear and sophisticated, driving every action from theft to contemplation. Her specific skill as an herbalist with obsessive olfactory sensitivity is demonstrated, not just stated, making her choices feel inevitable. The final change is earned through a direct confrontation with the story's central mystery, showing a shift from seeking external keys to internal understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions logically. The transition from pilot to guardian is earned through action. However, the final interiority ("ready to scream back") feels slightly generic, a shift in register from the more grounded, sensory experience that precedes it, which slightly undermines the specificity of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Veyra’s motivation is powerfully established by the flight engineer's patch, creating a potent internal conflict between her data-driven professionalism and a growing, reluctant intuition. The change is earned, culminating in the loss of the patch, which serves as a physical shedding of her old self-defeating certainty. The final choice to "Listen" instead of document is a resonant and credible character shift, earned by the preceding terror.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Liora’s motivation is powerful and clear, and her final choice feels earned. The interiority is strong, especially the embodied synesthesia ("listened with her skin"). However, some internal thoughts read as overly polished thematic statements ("certify wonder as essential," "silence was just another kind of cage") rather than the messier contradictions of a mind in crisis, slightly reducing the sense of immediate, lived-in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional and economical. The shift from a guardian defined by duty to a seeker defined by doubt is earned through concrete actions—playing the flute to see, not seal. The internal conflict is dramatized beautifully in the line, "a path he no longer trusted." The final choice feels like a profound, earned culmination of thirty years of silent certainty unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's motivation is sharp and character-particular from the outset. The internal conflict between his detached, analytical goal and the overwhelming reality of the emotions he "borrows" is dramatized with immense skill. The story perfectly earns his final transformation, with the "unborrowed" laugh serving as a powerful, embodied demonstration of change. The cost—the dissolution of his safe, observational self—is deeply felt and makes the final choice resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courier’s arc from trembling uncertainty to calm resolve is clearly bookended and effective. His motivation to understand his mentor’s absence is a strong driver. However, the transformation feels slightly accelerated, relying heavily on the woman's exposition rather than a more protracted internal struggle, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s characterization is exceptional. His motivation to understand echoes is established with specific, nuanced interiority ("measured silence in degrees"). The internal conflict between his disbelief in ghosts and belief in echoes provides a compelling tension that culminates in the final, earned renunciation. The choice to shatter the prism is a powerful act that demonstrates a fundamental change, paying a visible cost by destroying a link to his mother to achieve a new, hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is archetypal yet potent, driven by a singular, unwavering motivation that feels both mythic and deeply personal. The spinner’s grief is embodied in her “desperate precision,” and her final acceptance of the cost is a powerful moment of earned renunciation. The lover’s brief appearance is masterful in its economy, conveying a universe of shared history and loss in a single, silent action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The blacksmith's characterization is strong, with his meek nature and "slow-burning" will creating a compelling internal contradiction. His motivation is clear and his final transformation into something "with edges" feels earned. The only minor weakness is the slightly too convenient memory of his father's words, which functions more as a thematic signpost than an organic piece of interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority is rendered with concrete, particular detail. Her unique perceptual ability is not just a label but the engine of the entire narrative, shaping every choice. The final shift from an external search to an internal choice is a perfectly earned change, demonstrating a hierarchy of values with a clear, felt cost as her old reality dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias’s transformation from a silent man defined by a dead duty to a participant in a living legacy is masterfully executed. The internal conflict is shown, not told, through the tangible actions of pocketing glass, burning letters, and finally, stacking stones. The final choice to stay is earned through a slow, credible accumulation of connection, and the cost—the rotting skiff—makes his newfound peace feel substantial and real.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora's characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction where her laughter is a weapon and the storm's hunger is "like a lover's breath." Her motivation—a duty born from a cyclical bargain—is clear, consistent, and feels ancient. The brief backstory regarding the fishermen provides sharp, efficient stakes for her isolation, and her final choice to endure is earned with the palpable cost of eternal vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The dye master’s motivation is clear and deepens organically from a quiet ache into a life-altering quest. The final shift—from wanting to understand a storyteller’s power to becoming a facilitator of healing—is an earned change, supported by a clear internal journey and paid for with the loss of the wing and his former quietude. His perceptions, filtered through the lens of a dye master, are specific and consistent, making his interiority feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is nearly flawless. Elias's motivation as a "listener" to broken things is established early and his actions—deconstructing to understand, not fix—are perfectly consistent. The emotional climax, with tears "from the sheer pressure," is brilliantly embodied, avoiding sentimentality and earning the final, quiet resolution where he returns to his work, changed but still himself.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is primal and clear, rooted in her role as the "last memory keeper." The story powerfully embodies her struggle through physical pain—bleeding fingers, a burning throat—which makes her final choice to persist feel earned and costly. The internal conflict between her terror of the method and her determination to use it is established early and drives the central action. Her final transformation from an individual keeper to the communal song itself is a potent, earned change that pays off her entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena’s characterization is exceptional, with her core contradiction—empathy as the cause of her reclusion—dramatized through specific, embodied details like feeling unread books as “phantom limbs.” The final change is earned through the crucible of the climax, avoiding a simplistic epiphany by rooting her new purpose in a re-understanding of her past self. Her motivation is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in her defining trait of noticing—and questioning—the abnormal. Her interiority is revealed through precise, character-particular actions, like pressing crumbs into soil "not as offering, but as question." The change she undergoes is less a shift in character and more a fulfillment of it, culminating in an earned act of quiet leadership that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation shifts from a professional, abstract goal ("extraction") to a deeply personal one, a change that is well-dramatized and emotionally resonant. The transition is triggered by a specific, potent stimulus—the woman's face—and his reaction is convincingly embodied ("Elias’s hands trembled"). The only hairline friction is the brief explanation for his recognition ("in dreams, in the margins of his own ledgers"), which feels slightly less earned than the rest of his immediate, on-page journey.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in her father's legacy and embodied by the watch fob. Her interiority is specific and compelling, particularly the goal to hunt "the sound of trust breaking," which avoids cliché. The final choice to walk away, letting the market's rules enact justice, is a powerful act of renunciation that feels earned and consistent with the quiet, observant competence established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lira’s characterization is exceptional. The core contradiction of the “luminous skeptic” provides a powerful engine for her arc, making her final surrender to a new kind of physics feel earned rather than passive. Her internal conflict is shown, not told, through her actions and sensory perception. The transformation is profound, crystallized in the line “she’d been wrong about everything—and that was exactly as it should be,” which lands with the full weight of a discarded worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is deeply rooted in his grief and repressed artistry, creating a potent internal conflict. The character change is earned and visceral, particularly in the climactic painting scene ("The first stroke was a scream"). The "mnemonically gifted" trait, while functional in the climax, feels slightly more like a convenient label than a fully integrated aspect of his lived experience, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elias’s core contradiction—a calligrapher who beautifies truth while being physically unable to lie—is established immediately and provides a powerful engine for the plot. His internal conflict is embodied, not just stated, and the final choice to "let the words bleed" is a perfectly earned renunciation of his old identity, representing a costly but necessary change.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Her motivation to “coax” songs from the ice is clear and consistent, and her seasonal mutism is an embodied trait that shapes her entire worldview, not just a label. The final moment of quiet satisfaction represents a powerful Earned Stasis, reaffirming her purpose with a felt, resonant cost—the destruction of the beautiful object she sought to understand.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.8)
    The characterization is exceptional, portraying Elias’s internal conflict—the programmed protector versus the emergent individual grappling with fear—with profound depth. The contradiction between his purpose to "contain chaos" and the necessity of destructive creation is the story's powerful engine. The final, earned decision to leave is a testament to a complete and resonant character arc, with the cost of his old life made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira's motivation as a "curator of forgotten things" is clear and consistent, driving her actions from curiosity to facilitation. Her interiority is effective, particularly the moment she feels the "weight of a voice Mira hadn’t earned the right to hear," which shows a complex internal reaction. The character arc from investigator to listener is earned, though the final lines feel slightly too self-aware and summarizing, pulling back from the embodied emotion of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s transformation from a logical decoder to an embodied interpreter of secrets is earned and compelling. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to carry the code rather than report it is a powerful demonstration of her changed hierarchy of values, showing a deep internal shift with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lantern lighter's motivation is rendered with exceptional, non-abstract clarity; his grief isn't just a label but a physicalized quest with specific tools. The contradictory impulses of hope and despair are embodied in the ritual itself—a desperate act of creation to recover something lost. The final choice, a form of Earned Stasis turning into Charged Poise, is perfectly earned by the horrifying partial success of his endeavor; he doesn't give up, but his goal is repriced with a terrible new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    The summoner's motivation is exceptionally clear and her final shift from active struggle to earned rest provides a compelling arc. The change is earned through the on-page failure and subsequent re-evaluation of her goal. Interiority is strong, though a few moments rely on slightly abstract descriptors rather than fully embodied sensation, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is specific and compelling—not abstract scholarship, but a personal need to understand his whispering inheritance. His transformation from a curious listener to a burdened interrogator, and finally to the next gatekeeper, is earned and resonant. Veyra is a masterfully drawn archetype, defined by potent details like his ink-stained fingers and the smile of a man who’d "died once already," which the ending pays off perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s motivation is established with powerful clarity and drives the entire narrative. The internal conflict between her initial skepticism and desperate belief is rendered with convincing, embodied emotion, culminating in a choice that feels both tragic and triumphant. Her transformation from a person into a concept—a "library"—is earned through the preceding struggle, making the story's final moments resonate deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The forger’s internal arc from treason to forgiveness is well-realized and compelling. However, the Emperor’s motivation is underdeveloped; his sudden shift from tyrant to weary penitent feels convenient rather than earned, weakening the crucial two-character dynamic. His line, "You forged my hand, but never my heart," functions as unearned, diagnostic self-absolution that undermines the scene's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Veyra's motivation is clear and her final renunciation carries a tangible cost, which is strong. However, her pivotal moment of understanding ("She understood then...") is delivered as a declarative summary rather than a fully dramatized, embodied epiphany, which slightly undermines the interiority at a key juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lena's characterization is exceptional, driven by an internal conflict that is shown, not just summarized. Her motivation to find truth in wreckage is established early and tested in the scene, first with the widow and then with her own past. The final interaction with her mother's memory—"I did. I just kept the parts worth saving"—is a perfect micro-choice that solidifies her philosophy as an act of earned stasis rather than simple endurance, meeting the 9+ test with clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kael's philosophy is embodied in his every action, from mending the net to stirring the tea, avoiding abstraction. Liora's arc from pragmatism ("Why fix what no one sees?") to a profound internal shift is motivated and earned by the on-page demonstration with the minnows. Her final awareness of her own "secret tide" is a potent and specific moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is exceptional, executing a complete and earned reversal of the protagonist's core identity. Voss's journey from a debunker of "banal horrors" to a willing catalyst for a world-altering event is made credible by the vision he receives. The final lines, "of course the truth wasn’t a conspiracy. It was a *garden*," and his subsequent laughter, perfectly crystalize this profound, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias’s transformation from a passive receiver (“the needle”) to an active creator (“the hand”) is masterfully executed. His motivation is established early and his internal conflict between two allegiances is made concrete through his actions. The final choice feels both surprising and inevitable, earned by the story’s internal logic, and his final state is perfectly captured in the chilling dialogue with his reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his relationship with his mother. The internal conflict between hoarding memory and sharing it is expertly dramatized by the girl's arrival. The final change feels earned, a renunciation of his solitary obsession for a more meaningful connection, and the cost of letting go of his original goal is palpable. His interiority is concrete and specific, avoiding abstract emotional summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The engineer's motivation is rooted in a unique professional competence—understanding the marina's "language"—and a clear moral calculus. The internal conflict is concisely captured ("Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay") and resolved through a choice that has a clear, embodied cost, earning the final transformation into "something less human, more ethereal." Her competence and sacrifice feel specific and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lior’s motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a consistent philosophy that is tested by external doubt. His final choice is a potent, earned culmination of his internal conflict, with the cost of leaving his community made tangible in the simple, powerful action of turning his back. The characterization is flawless for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal conflict between his official role and his father's philosophy is established early and pays off in the final choice. His methodical nature is embodied in his actions, and the shift from investigator to advocate feels earned, culminating in the specific, non-clichéd emotion of "the raw, jagged edge of breaking free," which powerfully lands the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, deeply rooted in his professional and personal history of regret. The internal conflict between passive guilt and the active challenge presented by the heart is dramatized with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pip's motivation is compelling and powerfully embodied in her obsessive actions. The character arc lands with a resonant cost, symbolized by the arrow melting into her chestplate. However, the use of explicit, abstract labels like "yearning algorithm" and "steadily curious" reads as diagnostic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent show-don't-tell approach to her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lena’s motivation is intensely clear, specific, and drives every action. The transition from professional detachment to deeply personal rebellion is earned through the inciting incident of her brother’s name. The final choice to embrace deletion is a powerful and credible culmination of her grief and determination, showing a profound character change with a visible, ultimate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s core internal conflict—his passive, "shadow-laced" nature versus the demand for active intervention—is established economically and serves as the story's engine. The motivation to act is earned through the visions of the "anomaly" of courage, and his final decision feels like a profound, costly transformation rather than a simple choice. The line "This was *choice*" marks a perfect, earned pivot in his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lior’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in specific interiority. The story masterfully depicts the internal conflict between her detached despair and a latent impulse for connection, which surfaces in the impulsive decision to save the dog. The resulting laugh is a perfectly executed, startling moment of change, making her final renunciation of her plan feel earned and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior's interiority is concrete and compelling, particularly in the contrast between his earth-bound nature and Mira's celestial one. The motivation is clear, and the final action of sketching is an earned micro-choice that reveals character. The score is capped below 9.0 because the final realization borders on diagnostic self-awareness ("learning to hold the tension of two truths at once"), which slightly abstracts the emotion instead of leaving it fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lysan’s characterization is exceptional, defined by a powerful internal contradiction: her duty to preserve quiet wisdom in a world suddenly deafened by fervor. Her motivation is embodied in every action, from the press of the half-mask to the consecration through silence. The final line—"strangely honest, strangely whole"—lands with earned resonance, fulfilling the promise of her introduction and paying off her quiet act of defiance with a profound internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear and consistent, embodied in her specific actions. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic self-awareness ("Collective healing wasn’t about erasing scars... but stitching them into something larger"), which feels more like an authorial thesis than a character's thought. This abstraction slightly undermines the otherwise concrete portrayal of her quiet, purposeful nature in the story's key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dr. Veyne's motivation is rendered with superb economy, shifting from a scholar's obsession born of obsolescence to a renewed, collaborative hope.

His internal state is consistently shown through his interaction with the environment, making his final shift from reticence to action both credible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is potent and his internal state is rendered with exceptional specificity, particularly the "precognitively forgetful" trait that pays off beautifully at the climax. The character's shift from compulsive searching to quiet acceptance is earned through the confrontation. The only minor weakness is the sculpture's voice stating the theme so directly ("you never learned how to let them go"), which slightly undermines the otherwise masterful interiority by providing a diagnostic label at a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and well-rooted in his identity as a "sage of broken things." The internal conflict between his lifelong habit of imposing order and the clock's invitation to embrace change is palpable. The final choice to "match its rhythm" is an earned transformation, representing a profound and costly renunciation of his former self, which makes the character arc deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Lena's internal conflict is powerfully embodied in the vinyl shard, a specific and potent anchor for her motivation to be "decisively kind." The final act of releasing the shard is an earned renunciation with a clear emotional cost, resolving her internal stasis. Mrs. Calloway is drawn with sharp, efficient strokes, her gallows humor providing a perfect foil that grounds the scene and avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and provides the engine for the entire plot. Her defining trait—a quiet, deliberate curiosity that overrides institutional warnings—is established early and tested at the climax. The final choice feels like an inevitable expression of her character, and the line "Good. Then I won’t be alone" is a superb moment of crystallization, transforming a potential threat into a welcome promise.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, grounded in her profession as a "bone-setter," which provides a powerful and consistent lens for her actions. Her motivation—to understand and mend a "cleft in certainty"—is clear and compelling. The character trait "forgiving skeptic" is beautifully dramatized in her non-hostile, shrewd approach to the changeling, making her final bargain feel both earned and inevitable. The shift from setting bones to setting the world is a resonant and fully earned character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's motivation and interiority are rendered with exceptional specificity and consistency. Her philosophy is embodied in her actions, particularly the slow, patient polishing of the sea glass. The backstory of her grandmother and Elias provides a clear and compelling foundation for her present choices, making her acceptance of the apprentice feel both inevitable and earned. The characterization is nearly flawless, though the internal conflict lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory impulse just before the resolution, reading more as serene fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lena's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is concrete and dramatized through her actions, not just stated. The internal conflict between her need for solitude and her decision to guide Javier is subtle but powerful. The final, earned choice to give away the pendant demonstrates a meaningful character change, moving from passive protection to active healing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias’s motivation is intensely clear, and his internal conflict between rigid control and necessary surrender is the story’s engine.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is powerfully established, stemming from a direct threat and a legacy of warning. Her internal conflict—the safety of tinkering versus the demanded truth of singing—is the story's engine, and her final shift to "keeper of songs" is earned with a visible, felt cost ("throat burned, her chest tight"). The contradictory impulses are dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that redefines her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply embodied. The alchemist's motivation is established through concrete action and internal reflection, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elira’s motivation is clear and her interiority is beautifully embodied, not stated. The shift from an active agent ("weaver") to a passive vessel ("loom") is a powerful, earned character change. The transformation is catalyzed by an external pressure that forces an internal reckoning, and her final choice to renounce her human life for this new role feels inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)

Her contradictory impulses (the practical need to sell vs. the emotional need to carve and, finally, to keep) are dramatized effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s character is rendered with exceptional depth for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena's characterization is strong and consistent; her core trait as a problem-solver who dismantles systems drives every beat. Her motivation to enter the forbidden terminal is clear and compelling. However, her interiority remains primarily on a cognitive, calculative level, lacking a deeper layer of embodied emotion, which slightly flattens the impact of her discoveries. The line "She didn’t cheer. She calculated" is excellent, but this mode dominates entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.5)
    The scribe’s motivation is viscerally clear, progressing from fearful stasis to a decisive, cathartic action. His internal conflict between regret and fear is not merely stated but embodied in his initial hesitation and final, deliberate choice. The transformation is earned with a legible cost, making his final peace feel authentic rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.5)
    Liora’s motivation is consistently dramatized through her handling of objects and her choices. The internal conflict is rendered with subtlety, particularly in the contrast between her self-perception and the water's reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elias's characterization is exceptional. His motivation evolves from a macabre trade to a profound calling, a change earned through the story's central discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s core contradiction is compelling and her motivations are clear. The internal conflict is well-embodied in the act of sewing the coin onto her coat. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of over-articulated self-awareness, particularly the line, “But Liora knew the truth: she carried both flames now... and she had long since learned to tell them apart,” which reads more like an authorial summary than an earned, in-the-moment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s character is compellingly drawn through the contradiction of being a “luminous skeptic.” Her motivation is rooted in a well-sketched internal state—her own “sharp-edged” memories—which makes her final, destructive choice feel earned rather than abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
    Veyra’s motivation is crystalline and earned, moving from a sentimentalist’s observation to a revolutionary’s choice. The internal conflict is dramatized through her interaction with the gear, culminating in a choice that is both logical and emotionally resonant. The sacrifice of a specific, poignant memory—"the moment she’d realized the garden was both cradle and cage"—provides a perfect, character-defining cost for her change.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The carver’s motivation is palpable and his internal conflict is beautifully externalized through his craft. The final choice to carve the "hollows" is a powerful, earned shift. The only minor weakness is the slight over-articulation in the final poem he adds, which summarizes his new mission statement a bit too tidily for a character who has just had a breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.8)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated.

The final earned choice to continue carving is a powerful expression of his resolved, if unending, internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's characterization is superb, establishing a core contradiction—"blithe" yet intimate with the dead—that the story beautifully resolves by deepening, not breaking, his nature. His motivation is clear and his actions are consistent, particularly his calm acceptance of the supernatural, which is perfectly rooted in his established traits. The final shift from blithe to deepened understanding is earned through the on-page struggle with the knots, making the final choice feel inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, the interiority occasionally slips from a character's specific, embodied experience into a more abstract, authorial voice, particularly in the final two paragraphs. The line "Innovation was never about control..." reads more like a thematic summary than a character's earned, in-the-moment thought, slightly flattening the earned intimacy of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in his professional identity and a desire to shift from archivist to catalyst. His interiority is conveyed effectively through his actions and the atmospheric details he notices. The arrival of Lira provides a strong crucible moment, solidifying his purpose and precipitating his final, costly choice. The characterization is potent, though it leans slightly more on archetype than on deep, contradictory internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora’s characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a potent blend of ritualistic action, precise interiority, and resonant backstory. Her motivation is complex and consistently expressed—notably in the paradox of burning a portrait because she "understood him too well," which establishes a credible, non-obvious artistic philosophy. The internal conflict between creation and destruction, knowing and suggesting, is embodied in her mask and her methods, earning the story's contemplative tone without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in specific trauma (his mother's death) and a coherent worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias’s interiority is rendered with poetic precision, and his motivation feels deeply earned.

The final choice to hum feels like a credible, costly renunciation of a past ideal, perfectly aligned with his established character.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in sensory, embodied memory. Elias's internal conflict is dramatized effectively in his hesitation before eating the fruit, and his final transformation from "chef" to "gardener of moments" is earned and resonant. The change is not just a decision but a fundamental re-pricing of his identity, completed with a felt social cost (disapproval from critics and elders), making the arc fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elias's internal conflict—the weight of his duty versus the fear of failure ("*You’re afraid it won’t work.*")—is both embodied and resolved through a decisive, costly action. His transformation from burdened keeper to a man whose chest feels "light for the first time in years" is earned by the story's causal spine, meeting the highest standard for a character arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora's motivation is clear, specific, and drives the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, evocative details ("like the scent of her grandmother’s house fading"), and her final shift from seeker to knower is earned through her on-page actions and the subtle, felt cost of leaving the shard behind. The characterization is flawless for this length, with her defining trait—noticing—powering both the inciting incident and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    The human’s character arc from antagonist to convert is executed with remarkable efficiency. The internal conflict is made tangible through physical reactions—trembling fingers, hitched breath, and finally tears. Liora’s motivation is clear through her actions, and her nature is perfectly captured in the line "incisively kind, not a scalpel but a chisel," which justifies the rapid but earned change in the intruder.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lena’s characterization as a “grim optimist” is masterfully executed, not as a label, but as the engine of the plot. Her motivation is clear, specific, and tested in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, establishing a complex internal state through concrete action and perception. The contradiction between Lysander's brokenness and his cunning is dramatized, not summarized, culminating in a final choice that feels both surprising and inevitable.

His motivation is clear and his internal arc is perfectly scaled for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.6)
    Leeward's motivation to "dub" the storm rather than master it is established early and provides a unique character drive. His interiority is conveyed through wonderfully specific physical sensations, such as "fingers twitching as if plucking invisible strings" and the "restless energy that hummed in his bones." The final shift from fear to "the thrill of the next note" is an earned and resonant change, representing a full arc within the short space and fulfilling the 9+ standard for a choice earned with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elyas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific: the “gnawing certainty” that the watchers are waiting for him. This personal conviction elevates him beyond a simple lore-keeper. His actions—decoding patterns, using the whistle, pressing his forehead to the shell—are all consistent and embodied expressions of his "quietly driven" nature, culminating in a final choice that feels both inevitable and earned. The characterization is lean but potent, satisfying the 9+ test with contradictory impulses (fearful reverence vs. determined action) resolved in the final, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is concise and potent. Veyne’s internal conflict—being "emotionally rational as ever, though his pulse betrayed him"—provides a grounded, contradictory humanity. Callahan serves as an excellent foil, his motivation rooted in a believable, if flawed, ideology ("burn the tapestry to find a single loose thread?"), making the conflict philosophical rather than merely physical. Both characters' actions are direct, earned consequences of their established worldviews.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional.

This choice is rooted in every prior beat and carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)

Her final choice is both surprising and inevitable, a hallmark of masterfully earned character action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s motivation is compelling and her arc from detached observer to connected participant is earned and satisfying.

The contradictory impulses are live in the scene, earning the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elias’s internal conflict is rendered not through summary but through the tangible friction between two symbolic systems: the compass of his idealized past and the utility poles of his regretted present.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in a specific past trauma. Her interiority is beautifully rendered, particularly the line "willingly perplexed...chased riddles into the dark and called it devotion," which elegantly justifies her actions. However, the internal narration veers close to diagnostic self-awareness in the line "For the way she’d hoarded grief like a miser, for the way she’d let the past eat the present raw," slightly undermining the earned, embodied nature of her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Lien's characterization is exceptional, conveyed through a powerful synthesis of action and interiority. Her motivation is singular and clear, while her internal state—a mix of ancient grief and profound resolve—is embodied physically through the feeling of lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elira’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by the poignant contradiction of a “philanthropist with empty pockets.” Her motivation to understand transformation is abstract but grounded in every action, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)

    Liora’s interiority is textured—frost traced like “script,” ash in the lungs—but her brother is a bloodline fact, not a relationship under pressure. The adaptive trait is asserted rather than seen in costly micro-choices, and renunciation of the ledger strip feels more symbol than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s grief, resolve, and embodied memory are vivid; the bleeding fingers and heat-map burn show cost. Yet the interior contradiction—grief vs hope—never collides in a single beat; the shift from survivor to storm-player feels slightly telescoped rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s interiority as a stoic undertaker is convincingly embodied and threaded through salt-cracked hands, anemone-light, and micro-choice to swim the lighthouse. Stubbornness shows in the quiet decision to *add his own name* at the end, a renunciation that carries cost and satisfies the Earned Stasis test. However, the interior contradiction between “didn’t believe in signs” and immediate conviction by bone-deep vibration remains slightly under-examined in scene, keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s gentle persistence is embodied in tactile bell-handling and midnight runs; contradictory impulses (risk vs care) remain internal yet visible. The final renunciation—never ringing again—carries felt cost and is earned by prior causality. Liora’s brief presence supplies external pressure that alters tactics. Minor: no second on-page character for status crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—questing to locate lost love yet fearing the memory that delivers it—remains embodied in the jade test and micro-choice to press it to his chest. Interiority is richly sensorial and specific, the prior-life as plague physician and masked failure grounding his present stance. The final renunciation—turning the camera away from recording to carrying the reclaimed love—pays off with on-page cost: the jade vanishes into weightlessness, his laugh a felt after-shock. Secondary “woman with hands outstretched” is more projected memory than active agent, so relationship pressure is implied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Liora's interior contradiction—designer bent on unbuilding—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing thorns, clenching the halo), and the final “build the edges” stance carries visible cost. Emotions are grounded in sensory detail and contradict cleanly (laughter as she gasps at being re-sewn into time). Motive is coherent yet the backstory flash reasserts itself three times with diminishing returns, dulling contradiction under the peak beat and capping full arc impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—caution versus recklessness—surface in the deliberate poppy-seed trap and the final scattering of seeds. Her interiority is embodied (“hands stained with dirt and purpose”) and her micro-choice to plant irregularly shows a hierarchy of values. The renunciation of the next vault visit tomorrow forecloses safety with visible cost. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “chained liberator” risks label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—precision by day, messy imprinting by night—are embodied in the forge’s heat and the copper’s hum. His final renunciation of naming the aurora’s colors crystallizes a cost already paid in scars and silence. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic speak intrudes. The only flaw is the late, off-stage sister whose absence is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    Liora’s motivation precedes every scene choice, but interiority is summary and ornamental. No appreciable contradiction or trade-off under pressure; her arc is pre-determined rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for answers yet fearing the cost—are embodied in her tactile handling of the bookmark and the valve. The final renunciation (leaving the room to the flood) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons the sanctuary she once fled. Interiority is specific and glass-centric, avoiding stock phrases. Only the “thoughtfully spirited” label remains slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—fear of water vs. need to reclaim identity—are embodied in trembling grip, jagged shell edge, and the ledger choice. Micro-choice to bleed on the shell crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The girl’s presence forces status shift and immediate pressure. Closure cost—walking out with proof but still terrified—is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eldrin’s obsession with silence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing gold leaf, pressing stone—and his final renunciation lands as Earned Stasis. Interiority is specific, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure. The cost (dissolving into quiet) is felt yet abstract, slightly undercutting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interior contradiction is sharp—"methodical unraveling" against reverent stillness—and embodied in the micro-choice to set the violin down in order to reach out "not with its hands." Emotions land through frost-tingled servos and sensor overload rather than labels. Yet the cost of recovered identity is asserted more than dramatized; we feel awe rather than grief or terror, tightening the band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is embodied and specific—thumb pressing cracked lens, pen hovering—yet her decisive act (sliding the ticket) arrives with only implied cost; the couple’s change feels more observed than compelled by her agency, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The vine dresser’s interiority is vivid—her tactile polishing of cracked marbles embodies both grief and defiance—but her final “smile” feels slightly abstract, lacking a contradictory impulse under pressure. The elders remain functional symbols rather than crucible characters, so relationship pressure is muted. The earned renunciation (letting the garden speak) carries cost, yet the emotional layering stops just short of contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is drawn as a driven outlier whose contradictory loyalty to science and to K-11 crystallizes in the lever choice, but his private motive is restated more than dramatized. The cost is felt—he defies protocol and loses K-11—but his interiority tilts toward philosophical summary (“step through”) rather than raw, embodied regret. Voice-specific detail (“mechanically warm residue lingering”) rescues him from stereotype, yet overall the arc leans on thematic statement rather than intimate contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to break silence yet fearing it—are embodied in the trembling hand on the program and the deliberate bow-stillness. His micro-choice to “wait” rather than play crystallizes a value hierarchy that costs him the safety of solitude. The ghost remains off-stage, so relationship/status bullets are waived; interiority alone carries the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. silence—are dramatized through trembling hands and the choice to withhold the forecast; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the “fault-tolerant” label is more asserted than embodied. Micro-choice to place the smudged illustration center-table crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Emotional progression layers hypocrisy and self-deception without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus compulsion—are embodied in the valve wheel and the radio; his final renunciation of flight carries visible cost (“tucking the wheel into his coat”). Interiority is concrete, though the father’s confession is slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s interiority is vivid—embodied in moss, swan, and breath—but motivation (“to witness change without judgment”) remains a static mantra rather than a tested choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tuning-fork memory and tactile listening are specific and embodied. The mother-daughter pair exert immediate pressure, forcing Elias to risk his professional boundaries. His final choice to keep the vial carries visible relational cost and crystallizes his arc from “fixer” to “reminder.” Only a trace of therapy-speak (“ordinary magic”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the tapestry and the diary ashes shows embodied contradiction between preservation and surrender. The final smile is earned by prior renunciation of balance, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chen’s interiority is vivid—ink, incense, trembling hands—but the final renunciation (“wasn’t running… transposing life”) is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet slightly under-embodied. Secondary characters (fisherman’s daughter, cook) serve as pressure vectors rather than relationships, so crucible effect is thin. Still, micro-choices (slipping the microdot, writing the ticket) align with motive and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The priest’s motivation—illumination over exorcism—is clear and unique, driving every pedal press and indigo stroke. Interior contradiction surfaces when he chooses to become the very assumption he sought to expose, paying the cost of self-erasure. Yet the shift from master to absent guide happens off-stage, blunting the felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Li Wei’s interior life is rich: his hands ache not from work but from the weight of unwritten fate, and we track the precise micro-shift when he moves from scribe to conductor. The fracture on the nautilus aligns with his own crack, an embodied emblem of time he can’t return to.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—conquest vs. self-fragmentation—is embodied in the mirrored confrontation; the merging costs him the tablet and the eternal loop, a credible renunciation. Motive intensifies from abstract lineage to visceral need to be whole. Minor slip: “conquer the labyrinth of self” edges toward label-speak mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence yet craving connection—are embodied in the broken needle and the cavern’s vibrations; the final choice to teach again is earned by the tactile epiphany at the phonograph horn, with the cost of reopening a door he once kept sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s compulsion to observe rather than act is embodied in tactile detail—fingers on brass, the vial of rust-stained vellum—but curiosity collides with solitary cost when silence is chosen; the contradiction is dramatized in the final refusal to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—grief as sustenance for the flowers—drives every beat; the micro-choice to recork the vial and walk away is earned by the prior revelation that his tears literally feed the Luminara. Embodied emotion (“fingers digging into the soil”) and sensory specificity anchor his arc without therapy-speak. The cost—abandoning the greenhouse and smashing his trade—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied (“his own breath hitched”), but the ethical-playful trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the final carving of the ladder is earned and costly, yet the prisoner remains off-page, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the past while inviting the child’s future—are embodied in her micro-choices (tapping the bowl, beginning a new melody). The final renunciation of “endings” is earned by the scene’s cumulative cost: her solitude, the unfinished song, the girl’s arrival. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The relationship with the child alters Liora’s stance and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—professional detachment versus empathetic fusion—drives every beat; the micro-choice to absorb the ache herself crystallizes her arc with visible cost. The chemist’s cowardice and tenderness twist together credibly, and his final sob lands as earned consequence. Status and power shift cleanly in the hand-off of the crumbling petal. No stock phrasing; embodiment is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s shift from profit calculus to quiet partnership is embodied in the locket hand-off and the midnight pact; the librarian’s guarded warmth feels lived-in. Yet the “quiet work” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final envelope, keeping the interior contradiction from full pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Reed’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hands “remembering” reeds before her mind does—but the final shift from sculptor to searcher is slightly under-motivated; the leap from “I need a dedication” to “I must find Syl” feels more thematic than character-driven. The cost of belonging is felt, yet Reed’s flaws remain gentle rather than complicating.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elspeth’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses to preserve the moths and to risk the city’s sleep are embodied in the burning/cold pendant and the ink that bleeds upward. The final act of hurling the jar is credibly motivated by prior beats, and the cost (boy unravels, city’s breath held) is felt. Yet the boy’s motives remain opaque, muting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—his palm on the damp earth, the glass eyes digging into skin—yet the final renunciation (“some equations weren’t meant to balance”) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. The contradictory impulse to solve grief mathematically collides with the acceptance of ambiguity, crystallized in the clouding of the once-clear eye. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Flawed passivity balanced by genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—lifelong invisibility vs. sudden need to reach out—are embodied in micro-choices (wedging the tape, stepping into light). The final offer of the key carries visible cost: surrender of anonymity. Interiority is concrete; no diagnostic speak. Only the woman’s side of the relationship stays off-page, so status crucible is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich and embodied, yet Liora’s final surrender reads slightly too smoothly; the cost is felt but not sharply articulated on-page. Competing impulses flicker but don’t bite hard enough to make renunciation feel inevitable before the moment arrives. Voice remains consistent and specific, avoiding cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s insomnia, painterly vocation, and wry fatalism are embodied in every beat—fingers “rough from turpentine,” refusal to sleep, the dry laugh at the altar. His contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. exhaustion) act simultaneously, culminating in the earned choice to keep painting the cracks. The final smile carries visible cost: he has traded rest for vocation again. Only the amber woman’s dialogue feels slightly expository, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the laugh that weaves into the cave’s harmony—but the decisive renunciation (leaving the pearl) is slightly under-motivated; we feel the wonder more than the cost. The contradiction between lifelong clairvoyance and present blindness is embodied, yet the “felt cost” of walking away is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—collecting silence vs. releasing it—are dramatized in the valve-toss; the ledger’s weight and the valve’s warmth embody cost. Interiority is specific (“salt-crusted edges,” “ghost of a note, not sounded, but navigated”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation (handing the valve to the child) forecloses his role as sole keeper, with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision as shield against grief—drives every micro-choice; the whispered admission “I don’t know where she went” lands as earned renunciation with visible cost (trembling hands, dissolved tool). Backstory fragment (sister’s vanishing) is anchored to present compass-needle cue and alters his final stance. Flaw complicates tactics: obsessive mapping both leads him to the vault and prevents earlier acceptance of loss. Embodied emotion (fogged breath, trembling) stays specific and non-diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s skepticism and grief are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing symbols, pressing the tile) and contradictory impulses (scoffing yet clutching). The final renunciation—letting the parchment go—earns its cost through prior beats and visibly forecloses the “summon” path. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “courageously kind” is label-speak mid-crisis, blunting the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lysander’s boredom-driven choices create the key turning beats (dropping the fragment, stepping into the corridor). Flaw: interiority occasionally drifts into grand abstract sighs rather than specific micro-choices under pressure. Morphs cleanly from ennui to liberating curiosity with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt, calculation, and sudden protective instinct—are embodied in micro-choices (writing names, grabbing the girl’s wrist) that escalate to the final renunciation of her father’s ledger. The interiority is specific and character-bound, though the girl’s arrival feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stationer’s texture-collecting obsession is vivid and embodied; his trembling fingers, pen strokes, and coat-pocket ritual make motivation tactile. Interior contradiction surfaces when the hum seduces him from observer to resurrector, yet the beat remains solitary—no relational crucible or status shift is tested. The final “promise” of a new tree is credible renunciation, but the cost feels light because Elara’s life, though beautifully rendered, never endangers his own. Still, the specific, sensory interiority keeps him individual, not type.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Daniel’s interiority is vivid—his ghosted identity is embodied in tactile rituals (tracing ridges, pressing label to steel). The final renunciation—tearing his name from the ledger and sealing it into the container—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by his earlier collecting of fragments. One slip: the “odd clarity” line risks diagnostic self-labeling, though it is quickly re-anchored in sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—debunker who secretly prays—remains embodied in micro-choices (pressing shell to cello, writing on skin). Interiority is specific, embodied, and culminates in a credible renunciation of his former stance with visible cost (blank shell, dissolved journal). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ quick test except for slight under-dramatized flaw compounding before final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—order vs. anarchy—are dramatized in the moment she embeds the stolen chip into wet paint; the gesture crystallizes her renunciation of mainland order with visible cost (betrayal of past self). Interiority is embodied (“chest tightened,” “fingers twitched”) rather than labeled. The final micro-choice—picking up the can again—earns her Earned Stasis: she commits to fluid resistance, foreclosing a return to rigid grids.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is textured through embodied detail (“breath fog… pulse steady”), contradictory desires (documentation vs. sabotage), and a credible renunciation: choosing art over futurity, paying with solitude and irreplaceable landscape. Motives build logically to the final click. The grain of sand moment cleaves change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s tactile perception and quiet refusal of recognition create a credible, embodied interiority; the micro-choice to realign the array without seeking credit crystallizes his values and costs him visibility. The hummingbird drone acts as an extension of his senses, but its agency never overshadows his. The final beat—picking up the broken watch—earns a resonant stasis that forecloses any triumphal arc. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is precise—her “dry wit” surfaces in the phrasebook’s “ink stains on her cuffs”—and her final step onto the lake is earned by earlier micro-choices (touching the glass, dissolving the page). The only gap is a missing beat of explicit internal contradiction before she accepts the herald role; the cost is felt but not fully embodied in her body.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tuner’s patience and embodied ritual (fork to temple, metronomic steps) are vivid and consistent, but his interior contradiction—why this town, why now—remains abstract; the final “balance is a thing you kept” lands as thematic summary rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. need for absolution—are embodied in the micro-choice to uncork the vial while overriding the instinct to flee. The perfume’s scent coils “like smoke,” grounding her interiority in sensory contradiction. The final renunciation (not answering the signal) is earned by the hush’s cost: she now carries Elias’s voice “light as perfume.” Minor slip: “the marrow of her bones” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt, filial duty, and hunger to rewrite history—are embodied in the lattice’s burn against his ribs and the whispered names. His micro-choice to pluck his father’s name from the unfolding wood crystallizes the arc and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; the final grin with “copperlight in his teeth” shows earned endurance rather than tidy growth. The only slip is a faint safety-hedge in the final smile that softens the moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—hunger vs. love, presence vs. dissolution—are embodied in every beat; the final renunciation (her veil unravelling into Vesper’s sapling ribs) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The keeper’s brief presence supplies status pressure without clutter. Only the keeper’s interior remains opaque, but she is secondary.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—calloused hands, salt-worn ropes, “half-remembered hymn” gait—yet the sleepwalking agency remains slightly abstract; the final smile and winged shadow crystallize a credible renunciation with felt cost, but the shift from passive trance to active choice could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—his disbelief in miracles yet belief in roots anchors every micro-choice. The contradiction between foreign callouses and childhood memory drives the planting of the seed. The final laugh is earned, carrying visible cost: the cracked sundial and the villagers’ cautious hope now rest on his shoulders. Only the “warmly curious” mural figures feel externally imposed rather than internally compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lena’s interiority is specific—her tactile attention to chalk, the hush before mailing—but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to send the name feels inevitable rather than wrested. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The “carefully inventive” trait is stated, not tested under pressure. Cost is present but soft: the loss is the name’s privacy, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s needle-stitch synesthesia and off-key humming gesture interior moves that re-embody emotion, but interiority lurches into the abstract (“constellations he could name”). Wallet-sized interior vs plot pivot balance nets mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—yearning to send the letter yet clinging to the pre-decision limbo—are embodied in the shard’s sting and the final release of the letter; the interiority is specific, the cost visible. No stock therapy-speak intrudes; the “moment before deciding” is dramatized, not labeled. The renunciation (letting the letter drift) is earned by the prior beats of hesitation and moonlit healing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—healer vs. survivor, innocence vs. shrewdness—are embodied in her tactile handling of coral and cast; the final gift of coral to the boy crystallizes her shift from translator to grafter with visible cost (aching ribs, relinquished talisman). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the boy’s pressure is on-page, so relationship crucible is minimal; this caps the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the warmth of the fragment, the smile at the end—but the “rediscover lost joy” motive is stated more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene. Micro-choices (pressing film to fresco, stringing it between trees) align with motive and carry visible cost (the film will fade), earning the Earned Stasis closure. Still, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her desire to escape “the weight of certainty” anchors motive, and the micro-choice to paint a door rather than restore shows earned change. Yet the fig-woman/old man figures remain archetypal mouthpieces; their dialogue lacks individuated voice and therefore fail to pressure Liora’s values in a way that compounds cost. Emotional embodiment is strong (“her pulse stuttered”), but contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation (stepping through the door) is legible and costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test at the low end.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s rogue-scholar charm is vivid in gesture and speech, but interior contradiction is only sketched; the final “smiling, hands in dirt” stance crystallizes his values yet feels slightly unearned because earlier beats show more cleverness than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The poet’s immortality and vocation root her every impulse; interiority hums with sensory contradiction—ink-veined hands vs stone-split motion. The postcard-driven micro-choice (“she ate the third copy”) crystallizes an earned renunciation of despair. No secondary character dilutes focus; the soldier ghost becomes an extension of her creative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—devotion to preservation vs. the need to silence—are embodied in the tremor of her hands and the final act of letting the chime fall. The interiority is specific, never clinical, and the renunciation carries a palpable cost. The flaw (over-devotion) directly triggers the climax, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Veyne’s guilt-driven recklessness and concrete embodiment (“second skin” of the scent) are vivid; interiority is character-specific and escalates to the climactic song, earning renunciation with visible cost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora's interior contradictions—loyalty to her father's legacy versus fear of communal censure—stay embodied ('pulse stutter', 'chain coiled like promise'). The tremble-turn at climax crystallizes her stakes ("she laid the blueprint atop it") with earned cost; elders' nod renders her refusal irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tremor when unfolding the letter, the way he pockets the meteorite before Madame Holloway arrives, and the final micro-choice to hum all embody contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority is specific—ledger ink “the color of dried roses,” dust read “like sheet music”—and the cost of reopening song is felt when his rusty voice cracks. The only cap is that Luca remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s grief-driven urgency and Liora’s precocious certainty are embodied through tactile micro-choices (analyzing wood grain, folding the husk). The final surrender—“teach me the codes”—earns a credible renunciation of control, but the interior contradiction between architect-father and seeker could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather and jellyfireflies anchor her contradictory impulses. The final hand-hold crystallizes her shift from isolation to tentative connection, with the cost of leaving the logbook behind. Kael’s scar and cautious grip add credible secondary pressure. Only the “landscape astrologer” label feels slightly ornamental rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied; the recollectionist’s contradictory impulse—yearning to recover lost paths yet fearing their cost—surfaces in the blood-glow moment. Micro-choices (plucking seed, pressing shard to ear, letting memories in) escalate stakes. Final renunciation of backward-looking is earned, but the “thousand half-remembered lives” summary edges toward label-speak, blunting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lior’s internality is textured and embodied; contradictions between performance and motive ring true. The “lightly attentive” stance evolves from posture to practiced calculus, but a micro-choice where the bishop cracks against his palm is vivid. Relationships are absent, so status and secondary pressures null; the score rises on solitary interior precision.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ink shimmered, alive”), but the tide dancer’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. Micro-choices (pressing moonstone to wrist, dipping fingers for Orion) are concrete, but the stakes pivot on a lyric leap rather than a crucible of conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—calloused fingers, oilcloth apron, stone like a forgotten promise—but the decisive micro-choice (dropping the stone) is under-motivated; we feel his need to commune yet never see the cost of that act foreclose a path. The daughter’s absence is evoked rather than dramatized, so the emotional pivot rests on memory rather than present pressure. Still, the embodied contradictions (stoic steadiness vs. longing) are specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to reconnect—are embodied in the tactile handling of the box and the ridge; the final choice to leave the box and send the photo is earned by prior interiority and carries visible cost (the empty pocket, the lighter step). Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock therapy-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy (trace face, open box, draw, send) reveals values under pressure. Flaws (silence, avoidance) actively complicate the path and are confronted by the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—equations in sea-foam, the gauge as pulse of lineage—yet the final beat leans on an abstract “laugh” rather than a bodily cost we can feel. Contradictory impulses (erase vs. preserve) play out in real time through her micro-choices of placement and surrender, but the emotional price is declared more than embodied. Still, her hierarchy of values (pattern over permanence) is legible and drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to map versus the need to remember—are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the negative, burning the door). The final renunciation of mapping in favor of living is earned by the corridor’s pressure and the mural’s cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One slip: “the weight of legacy” is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—she trades in hope yet refuses her own reflection—drives every beat; the renunciation of the cracked mirror at the end is earned by the earlier vision of the empty terrace. Embodied emotion (“her fingers brushing the cool glass”) and micro-choice (letting the mirror slip) keep her specific. The borrowed heartbeat aches in the soldier’s ribs, a felt cost that scales to the word count. Only the client remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s interiority is embodied and specific—thumb on the soft new notch, pulse tremor masked by training. The contradiction between hope and cynicism is dramatized in the moment she admits “Probably” to Kael, not summarized. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: she chooses to keep the clipboard and walk away, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is felt in the weight under her arm and the rain she refuses to watch.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—architect of engineered drought yet guardian of a memory-egg—are embodied in the salt pressed to his palm and the tremor in his jacket pocket. The internal contradiction of mourning the song he helped vanish charges the on-page act; the decision carries visible scar-cost as he releases the last trace and re-enters a life balanced by ledgers. No diagnostic self-analysis: the body’s salt-dust and heartbeat render guilt without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The interiority is embodied and specific ("her bare feet pressing into the frozen floor") and micro-choices under pressure ("she did not look back") pay off, but motivation tilts toward abstraction when her bodily “poetic restraint” is declared rather than dramatized in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers “rolling a charred stick” and the stick’s “grain blackened into stories” reveal motive and flaw. The contradiction between exposing truth and deepening darkness is dramatized in the miner’s lunge and Elias’s subsequent micro-choice to loosen the strings. Cost is felt when he pockets the still-glowing stick, accepting complicity. Minor slip: the “serene” trait is asserted more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “fingers brushing the papery wing” and the spiral’s construction enact his need to honor the forgotten. The contradiction between permanence and transience is dramatized in the act of weaving, not stated. The final renunciation—gathering new materials—earns the cost of endless remembering. Minor: the “esoteric realist” label is slightly diagnostic, but the rest of the voice compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over the last speaker’s death is embodied in the “molten silver” moment and the rope’s hair. The final choice to let the names change is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the card dissolves, the rope reseals). The only cap is the lack of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lior’s interior conflict—risk cautious vs. storm-drawn—is credible and embodied, but the final transcendence choice feels slightly over-telegraphed rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Qishti’s frugality and empirical irony are embodied in every micro-choice (counting tiles, stylus tracing), and the final kneel crystallizes an earned shift from measurement to felt devotion; the interior contradiction between scientific habit and mystical surrender is dramatized, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—resentment vs. the need to release—are embodied in the pin’s handling and the ghost-brother’s taunts. The final micro-choice (pressing the pin back, then letting the box fall) earns the renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the “scheming pacifist” label is never dramatized, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mirror maker’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory yet seeking erasure—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the sextant, breathing the fog). His final renunciation of boundaries is earned by the tactile cost of dissolving the sextant and stepping through the sky-door. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lacerating interiority—body-level ache, ribbon biting wrist—shows the cost of parental imperfection; the contradiction of love vs failed protection charges the final bite of the apple. Motivation arcs cleanly from duty-driven denial to willingness to relearn under pressure. Backstory is efficiently cued through prop and orchard without therapy-speak. Character emerges as individual rather than trope.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s contradictory hunger for knowledge and fear of drowning in it is embodied in micro-choices (pressing the cameo, eating the pistachio). The final renunciation—cataloging rather than hoarding—earns its cost through prior visions of predecessors who failed. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “danger was the point” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s linguist-thief persona is sharply drawn via selective interiority and embodied emotion; each micro-choice (pressing un-flowers, luring the traveler) is causally tied to the heist goal. Interior contradiction—grief as intellectual resource—drives the tragic outcome. An earned renunciation in the final beats adds Renorant final stillness with visible cost on page—his own erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven retrieval vs. communal rescue—are embodied in the scale-patch on her wrist and the ink-drinking swatch; the final renunciation (staying to save others) costs her the ship and is foreshadowed by the garden’s “wild names.” Interiority is vivid, but the sister’s off-page erasure keeps relationship pressure abstract, capping the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses (archivist’s need to record vs. instinct to merge) play out in micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—pocketing the seal instead of cataloging—earns its cost through prior causality. One hairline slip: “warmly methodical” is asserted rather than dramatized until the rope-work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eldrin’s interiority is vivid—stone against skin, breath fogging ice—and his preservation motive escalates to the climactic choice to invite rather than fight. The final heartbeat-press shows embodied cost. Minor: no contradictory impulses voiced in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the custodian’s loneliness and retrocognitive gift drive every micro-choice. The final laugh crystallizes her shift from rescue to pattern-recognition, with the mended prism as felt cost. One minor slip: “retrocognitively blessed” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Summer-Quill’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, pressing fingers to stone, tracing absent shadows—culminating in the earned renunciation of her dam-building impulse. The contradiction between collecting memories and letting them flow is dramatized, not labeled, and the final smile carries visible cost: she forfeits the archivist’s need to name and pin. Interiority is character-specific, sensory, and avoids diagnostic jargon. The lone flaw: the “vision” of her older self edges toward convenient epiphany rather than discovered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her chant, the kerosene knot, the way she “filters the darkness”—but the final beat (“the world was heavier…so was she”) is asserted rather than embodied; we feel the cost conceptually, not physically. Still, her contradictory impulse to both flee and ignite is dramatized in the rocket launch and the trembling earth, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is specific and embodied; the chronicler’s sideways sidling is dramatized in the grotto beat rather than asserted. Final act of pressing the cicada into the fisherman’s hand sells her definitive choice without speech; loss of verbal intimacy is the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—the child's lungs shrinking inside sealed metal tastes of rust, their palms stitched with ember threads. Micro-choices under pressure (three breaths in, two out to limit exposure; biting the final vine) are legible and scale with stakes. The father’s empty silence motivates abandonment without sentimental justification. Earned stasis: the child's refusal to look back is visible cost at the word “sigh of rust and dust,” sealing the path.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices—adjusting the dial, dipping the spoon—that reveal his vocation as caretaker of silence. The passenger’s unspoken grief is rendered through posture and breath, not labels. The final nod and drift constitute an earned renunciation with visible cost: the terrace is lighter, the vial clear, Elias alone again. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elsin’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. unmake—are dramatized in the orchard soil and the melting throne; her final renunciation carries visible cost as the chamber collapses behind her. Interiority is specific, embodied, and free of label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of retrospective omniscience in “she understood now,” slightly blunting the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—yearning to guard yet compulsively severing—are embodied in the trembling doorknocker and the cold shadow’s grip; the final renunciation carries visible cost as he steps through a door that dissolves the only refuge he has left. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinching. The only cap is that the shadow’s dialogue edges toward explanatory, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lina’s contradictory impulses—cynicism born of pyramid trauma vs hunger for agency—are dramatized in her palm-bleeding squeeze of the bolt; the diamond’s warmth against her thigh is a felt cost that forecloses return to the farm. Interiority is concrete and embodied, not therapeutic. The single POV holds without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’ interior journey from dynasty ender to “first to cross” is vivid; embodiment leans poetic rather than visceral, softening the cost, yet the contradiction—failure as culmination—is dramatized on the page. Micro-choices (strike floorboard, tune reflection) hinge on “eloquently silent” temperament and carry a felt renunciation of logical proofs. Reflection density (~33 %) dips momentum once, but present-tuned choice (tuning the mirror) re-anchors before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The knight’s seven-year silence and welded gauntlet are embodied through tactile micro-choices—brushing the stem, breaking the seal—culminating in a credible renunciation of silence that costs him literal shadow. Interiority is specific and contradictory: memory of siege as performance collides with present refusal to applaud. The final smile “hurt like holy fire” crystallizes earned cost. Minor slip: “he had been there, once. Or he would be” edges toward convenient temporal slipperiness rather than character-bound knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—protective archivist vs. man still grieving his own unread file—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands at the printer embody cost. The final act of mailing the packet renounces his habitual detachment, foreclosing the safety of emotional distance with visible, felt price. No stock therapy-speak; motives stay anchored in tactile objects and bodily reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s understated resourcefulness and quiet endurance are embodied in tactile details—boot-hidden key, ledger theft—without over-articulation. Interior contradiction is present but lightly sketched; her self-narrative as “harmless” clashes with subversive acts, yet the contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the key in the door) crystallizes her stance with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s demand for earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—"his breath curling into the morning fog like smoke from a dying fire"—but the final return to the grotto feels slightly under-motivated; the slip of paper is a strong external cue yet the interior contradiction between wanting silence and needing the call could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the moonstone’s warmth against her cheek and her micro-choice to climb anchor motivation. The final transformation into vine-woven skin shows earned change with visible cost. Yet the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—fixing vs unmaking time—drives every micro-choice; embodied tremble, pocketed compass, greenhouse descent all spring from the same flaw. Renunciation of certainty at the end costs him all prior purpose, a credible earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—rivalry vs. reverence for Veyra—drives every beat; the coin’s heat on her wrist and the vial’s memory dramatize embodied cost. The final choice to transmute herself is earned by prior causality and carries visible, felt price. Minor slip: “weight of a name” drifts toward abstraction mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the crocodile-tooth memory anchors her grief without slipping into label-speak. Her choice to scatter petals and trade jokes with the ghost is a micro-choice that reweights the stake and carries felt cost. The modest fearlessness trait is shown, not told, in her refusal to startle. Only the ghost’s voice remains slightly generic, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liran’s embodied trauma and micro-choices (pressing the strap as tourniquet, kneeling at the basin) are vivid and character-specific; the final renunciation of the equation is earned through prior sensory memory and carries visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak, but the grandmother’s aphorism edges toward convenient wisdom rather than lived contradiction, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s tactile, dust-reading expertise and quiet resolve are vivid; the final renunciation to “unmake” the mechanism is earned by his embodied horror at the child-laugh pendulum. Interiority stays concrete, but the ghosts’ dialogue edges toward explanatory label-speak, blunting full contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—decades spent imprisoning whispers yet yearning to free them—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation costs him the library and his own ontological footing, felt in the line “the system wasn’t the world. It was him.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s contradictory hunger for revision is rooted in lived failure—his need to re-imagine the Republic gives interior urgency and emotional cost. Flaws (poetic idealism versus actual sabotage) drive the closing gesture. Relationships remain static (no second on-page character), but personal evolution earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, cracked laugh, and the moment he names himself “a fool” all embody contradictory impulses. The final surrender of honesty and life to the stone is earned by his lifelong habit of mending lies. Yet the woman who delivers the box remains a cipher; no relationship pressure is on the page, so the crucible is purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—hunger for answers vs. fear of them—are embodied in the compass burn and the final refusal; the renunciation is earned and carries visible cost (silence chosen over knowledge). Interiority is specific, tactile, and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of abstract summary in “he understood then,” but the embodied cost of letting go rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s driftwood sculptor identity is vividly embodied in micro-choices—fingers, stone, carving—rather than exposition; flaws manifest in impulsive storm navigation and naive faith in the lantern slide. Interiority avoids label-speak, and the earned renunciation (leaving the carving) shows credible cost. Minor gap: the GPS failure’s impact on identity isn’t tied to any internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is embodied and specific—her stained fingers, the cold glass against her palm—but the final renunciation (“she didn’t paint it”) is slightly under-motivated; the causal bridge from understanding to renunciation could be one sentence sharper. Still, the contradiction between seeking answers and accepting silence is dramatized, and the cost of leaving is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—archivist vs medium—surfaces early and drives the climax; the renunciation of archiving for release is earned. Embodied emotion (pulse hammering, raw voice) grounds stakes. Yet the Revision Board officers remain functional silhouettes, muting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s refusal of comfort and his turn to “conception” are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tracing glass, holding the vision—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His interior contradiction (grief vs. alchemical rigor) acts simultaneously in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of the bottle carries visible cost: he is now custodian of a living memory, burdened with sustaining it. No stock interiority; voice stays particular and weathered.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’ interior contradiction (duty vs fear) is vividly embodied—shaking hands, cold fingers—yet the final choice (“sketch the pattern of his own fear… bury it beneath the oldest tree”) relies more on mystic inertia than on decisive agency; cost is atmospheric rather than palpably renounced. Interior texture is specific, but the hinge identity never challenges his competence beyond mood. No relationship or status pressure is tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—furiously tranquil hands, refusal to touch the chick—are embodied in micro-choices that escalate to the seed-planting act. The final smile and certainty feel earned because every beat roots in her grandmother’s hoard and the vortex’s prior takings. One slip: “furiously tranquil” is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment it first appears.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s “listening before sound” credo threads every choice; the moment he leaves slack in the whale-sinew to keep the bell’s voice honest crystallises motive and shows earned flaw-driven innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s spiritual curiosity and patient solitude crystallize in the lantern-resonant climax; the decision to open to starlight is undergirded by thirty-seven years of embodied hush, so the renunciation feels earned. Minor slack: we never see Eli misjudge or falter in a visible-on-page beat, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction is present—he guards silence yet is asked to surrender it—but embodied emotion is more gestural than visceral; final endurance reads as credible renunciation. Late reliance on retrospective “travelers came later” summary dulls immediate cost. Trait “tranquilly perceptive” is shown through the wind-gaze but not materially tested beyond stillness. Micro-choices (finger tracing box, exhale onto glass) are specific and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—his cracked watch ritual, the warm urn, the tremor when the twin ticks—yet his contradictory impulse (to mend vs. unravel time) is only summarized, not enacted in scene. The final smile and winding are earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the poet’s contradictory impulse—yearning for completion yet cherishing incompleteness—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“We are all just woven dawns, coming undone”) is earned by the prior handling of the feather, kite, and notebook. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flawed passivity is balanced by visible cost: the poem left deliberately unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—devotion vs. defiance—are embodied in her aching joints and copper-wrapped sapling; the final renunciation (death while working) is fully earned and carries visible cost. Tomas’s curiosity and eventual adoption of her stance create a crucible that alters the relationship state. Interiority is specific, tactile, and free of therapy-speak. Only a hairline slip: the “laughed, because what else” line edges toward convenient self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skepticism and ache for her father collide in the amber fly’s pulse. The final choice to dissolve into the galaxy is earned by prior micro-choices (touching the terminal, whispering the memory). Cost is felt: she forfeits her old life and identity. Only minor slip: the father’s “crutch for the faithless” line edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coachman’s interiority is embodied and consistent—his rough hands, salt-caked boots, and whispered dead tongue all reveal motive under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving without witnessing the bloom) is earned by prior beats: the empty pockets, the lamp-lit map, the sleepless dream of roots in rifles. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rook’s contradictory impulses—obedience to settlement rules vs. the pull of memory—are dramatized in the moment he stands and follows the cylinder; the leaf’s warmth against his paw embodies the cost. Interiority is specific to a scent-driven mind, and the final endurance inside the dome is earned by prior causality. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the station yet leaping toward the light—are embodied in the warming compass rose and the torn sketch; the final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she felt like an observer again”) nudges the score down from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirien’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—thief’s pragmatism versus “chivalrous” ethic—play out in the tactile swap of the sundial lid. The Keeper’s tremor when he finds his own name gives a credible cost. Minor: the “apprentice of wonder” label is slightly abstract, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Liora’s interiority crackles with self-contradiction and felt flaw; each walking-spell step unbinds both her shame and the world’s rules, earning the quiet ascension and soft loss that close the piece. Her shift from performance-grief to historian-of-absence is embodied, cost paid by silence chosen at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to reclaim a buried gift while fearing its cost—drives every beat; the mercury-glass eyes and silver streaks embody the price, and the final act of writing seeds the future with visible sacrifice. The arc from swallowed talent to active keeper lands with earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific—thumb against frayed threads, breath “productive”—and the tutor’s contradictory drive to both unravel and re-weave is dramatized in micro-choices. The final kneel and steady hand show earned change with visible cost (shame absorbed into platinum). Relationship with the girl is brief but functions as crucible: her invitation forces the decisive acceptance. Flaw: the “fourth move” backstory is asserted more than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—the longing to expose truth versus the self-protective pain of having been beaten—lock in concrete micro-choices: climbing toward the fissure instead of the spire, pressing bleeding fingers to bone. Her scraped-knuckle history of mischief, remembered while she writes, lets the past weaponize the present. The crescendo lands with an earned renunciation: no witness, no satisfaction, only the costly act itself. Cost is immediately visible—“her hands empty, her heart lighter”—and irreversible path closure is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend yet fearing insufficiency—is embodied in trembling fingers and mercury eyes; the final surrender feels earned because every prior beat braided doubt into action. Micro-choices (pressing the key, narrating to the void) reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over survival. Cost is visible in the dissolving workshop and relinquished control.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief and promise-keeping are embodied in the warm shell and ochre-stained hands; the final leap is earned by the shell’s reprise and the cave’s pulse. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The cost—burning the past and surrendering to the pool—lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—calloused fingers on cork, throat ache from “holding the note”—and his renunciation of the cork at the end is earned by the prior demonstration of intent’s power. Harkin’s single-scene arc from skeptic to pocketing the cork supplies a credible micro-relationship crucible. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he knew better”) early on.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—yearning to salvage the lost while believing salvage impossible—drives her midnight choices. Embodied moments (hand warming bronze, exhale fogging metal) ground her grief. Endurance is earned: she stays on the cliff, re-mapping absence, accepting the cost of never leaving. One detail felt therapy-adjacent: “ache in her ribs” teeters near label-speak but is rescued by the tide analogy two words later.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lior’s interior contradiction—neither thief nor savior—is textured via musk-smear and swallowed truffles; the final renunciation lands with felt cost, yet sister's suicide and archivist remain summarized off-stage voices, muting inner pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his need to keep the lighthouse yet release the stranger’s memory—are shown in embodied micro-choices (fingers tracing petals, adjusting the lens). The final Charged Poise feels earned because every action earlier—steeping the boutonnière, re-pinning it, lingering the beam—demonstrates the cost of acceptance and transmission. Interiority is precise and character-particular, avoiding sentimentality or therapeutic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—empirical skepticism vs. surrender to the chip’s pull—are dramatized in embodied beats (hissing at the flare, kneeling with ants). The final choice to follow the child’s sob is earned by the prior 23-year absence and the glowing residue on his skin, a visible cost. Interiority is specific to a map-dealer’s lexicon (“parchment and scale”). Minor slip: the woman’s ink-stained hands are introduced twice with identical phrasing, blurring distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her measured breath, the copper taste of magic, the needle-pain of starlight. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. buried childhood bargain) coexist in scene and culminate in the earned renunciation of her humanity. The final cost—loss of self, kingdom, mortality—is legible and scaled to the length. Minor slip: “disenchanted” is never dramatized; she seems more haunted than disenchanted.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s silent pivot from extraction to reciprocal offering is embodied micro-choice: the hush, the palm-to-palm pass of the shell, the jump through the moment’s split fruit. Interior contradiction shows in the comparison between trapped pocket suns and the act of letting them burn themselves out. Liora’s status as shared catalyst remains seamlessly legible through gesture, not exposition. Only Liora’s final tease “Took you long enough” skirts diagnostic summary, shaving the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—chronicler vs. burner—are embodied in the scroll and the match; the final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority is concrete (“feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs”), but the younger self’s dialogue drifts toward label-speak (“delusion of control”), capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—once a scent-reader, now scent-blind—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (crushing lavender ghosts vs. measuring ticks). The screw exchange crystallizes a value hierarchy: witness over repair. Cost is felt when he sketches the trembling hands, renouncing his own recovery. Minor slip: the aromatherapist label is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lian’s interiority is embodied and specific; the trembling fingers, scars, and pulse-press anchor her fear and desire. The contradiction between fear of crystallization and the need to carve runes is dramatized in the moment she presses the quill to her wrist. The final choice—shedding the tip into her scar—earns the transformation because earlier beats link scars to flawed glass and stories. Cost is visible: the quill is now tip-less, the scar sings, and the storm is unwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. professional detachment—are dramatized in the moment she withholds physical comfort; Elias’s trembling fingers and final “Stay for the dawn?” crystallize a credible shift in their crucible. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak. The cost of apology is felt in the empty vial and shared shovel.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“dust motes hung like suspended stars”), but the witness’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final renunciation (“simply, at last, forward”) is earned yet the cost feels diffuse rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—obedience to ritual vs. refusal to pull the ship through—are dramatized in the key-turn beats; the final renunciation costs him certainty and leaves a literal notch of consequence on the key.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—clinging to control while learning release—drives every micro-choice; the laser pulse she adds to the mycelium is a credible renunciation that costs her the scanner and her old identity. Elias is sketched only as witness, but his hushed “You see?” reframes her grief without stealing focus. The sister’s death is a reflective block that tilts the present choice and meets BRR limits.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lila’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. risk—are dramatized in the lantern choice; the final leap is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (“her palms stinging”). Interiority is concrete, embodied, and character-specific, though the father remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s quiet endurance and ritualized listening are embodied through tactile detail (glass disc, candle stub), but his interior contradiction—wanting connection yet enforcing distance—remains more asserted than dramatized; the caller’s stakes are sketched rather than pressured, so the final “try again tomorrow” feels compassionate yet low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers brushing violets, the locket’s edge pressed to her chest—but the final choice to “steep the past into the present” is more stated than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully foreclosed on the page, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—pragmatic logistician vs. myth-maker—surface in the moon-rock trade-offs; her final renunciation of ownership carries visible cost (“she left the rock…”) and reframes her loneliness. Interiority is embodied (boots crunch glass, rock cold as promise) and avoids label-speak. Secondary characters (Mira, Carter) apply pressure that alters her stance, satisfying crucible test. The only drag: Carter’s reveal as forger/poet feels slightly expository rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—salt/copper synesthesia, ring warmth, bone rune—yet the grief remains abstract until the final chord; the renunciation of external guidance is earned and costly, but the contradictory impulses (seek silence vs carry song) are stated more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—clinging to “wrong answers as data”—is embodied in micro-choices (dipping the pen into breath, pocketing the vellum). The final renunciation of correction in favor of re-planting carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. A hairline slip: the phrase “quiet, stubborn belief” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s embodied signing and Liora’s camera-shield choice reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; the final “we remembered them back” renunciation carries visible cost in the camera’s new weight. Interiority stays concrete, but Liora’s charisma is more asserted than tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—rescue vs. destroy—are dramatized in the final beats: the trembling book, the whispered name, the match struck. Interiority is embodied (“volcanic tenderness erupting”), not labeled. The renunciation (burning the ledger) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the archivist remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers twitched,” “the lagoon’s glow faded”—and the Renounced memory release is a visible, embodied choice with cost. Still, the contradictory impulses (want to heal vs want to purge) remain stated rather than dramatized mid-process; the sabotage hints never materialize in scene. The change is earned, but the character’s flaw never visibly risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lior’s interiority is concrete—his skepticism, his tactile coin-rubbing, his gait as confession—but the final choice to stay and listen feels more thematic capstone than earned pivot; no prior beat shows him weighing exit against lingering. The woman’s pressure is present yet too spectral to function as crucible. Overall, a vivid consciousness whose change is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Listener’s interiority is conveyed through embodied action—mirror tilts, shutter rhythms—rather than labels; her renunciation of speech and final smile carry visible cost. The boy’s shame is shown in trembling hands and hitched breath, not told. Both characters remain distinct and flawed; the father’s off-stage shift is credibly implied. Only the father’s interior arc is off-page, keeping the cap below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s quiet resolve and tactile relationship with the pawn and filings are vivid; the interior contradiction between chess foresight and civic resistance is embodied. Yet the children remain off-stage instruments, so relationship pressure is absent and the final “conversation” line feels slightly abstract rather than earned through prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic endurance vs. the ache to unfold—are embodied in salt-stung palms and the scrimshaw’s pulse. The final transformation is earned by the tactile history of the carving and the whale’s call, with the cost of leaving every human tether legible in the dockworkers’ averted eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—stillness vs. the need to scream—are embodied in micro-choices (whittling, climbing the railing) and culminate in the earned renunciation of silence. The bouquet’s crumble and the scream’s rawness make the cost visible. Harkin’s presence supplies status tension that shifts when he accepts the whittling lesson. Minor slip: “blank mask” leans label-adjacent but is quickly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between reverence and rebellion is dramatized in her micro-choices (hand on quartz, whispered line). The final renunciation—stepping back into the spiral as something “fluid and flickering”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of prior identity). Minor slip: “no longer afraid” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s color-blindness and plant-language are embodied in tactile choices; the dandelion “awaken” and thorn “patience” are micro-decisions that cost him vulnerability. Liora’s shift from listener to co-author is legible in shoulder-brush and hand-squeeze. The old woman’s bargains externalize stakes without exposition. Interior contradiction—fear of silence vs. need to speak—drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s longing for “texture of connection” is embodied in every micro-gesture—pressing the lens, turning it, leaving the bell—so motive stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the bell) carries visible cost: she forfeits ownership of the sound she sought. Interior contradiction is light; more could be mined from her fear that connection might remain impossible. Still, the arc earns its quiet stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s grief is embodied in wire and sleeplessness; her shift from lilies to cranes is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific—grief “coiled tight as wire”—and micro-choices (tracing stencil, folding cranes) reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile is earned because prior beats show her hands no longer ache. Minor slip: “teach withering to bloom” edges toward label-speak but is offset by the copper flower’s tactile irony.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—ink-stained fingers, tape-tracing, card-shuffling—that visibly cost him time and safety. The final renunciation of prediction for measurement is earned by prior beats and carries a felt price: he is left alone with the next looming collapse. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The quant’s grief is sketched with restraint yet pressures Elias’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the historian’s contradictory impulses (hunger vs. fear of knowledge) are dramatized in the pagoda turn. The final renunciation—letting the prism dissolve—earns its cost through prior pattern-avoidance training. Minor slip: “steady, unpredictable heart” is a label rather than embodied contradiction, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Liora’s interiority is specific—her “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” trait is embodied in the way she tracks shadows and light. The final choice to trade her shadow is foreshadowed by her lifelong habit of noticing thresholds, making the renunciation earned. The curator’s single line of dialogue is too brief to create a crucible, so relationship pressure is minimal. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s layered self-reproach and embodied care for Lumen are vivid; the contradictory impulses—con-artist reflex vs. healer instinct—play out in real time through the salve, the letter, the tincture drop. The final “balance” image crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost: he forfeits the last shield of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her scar “pulses” while plants whisper, grounding the telepathy in visceral cost. The micro-choice to write on her mother’s file crystallizes her renunciation of decoding scars, paying with the ache she finally allows. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance via the pen stroke. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis (“displaced miracles”) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “incubate” micro-choice anchors her arc. Motive—recovering the unsent love—remains legible and escalates through tactile interaction with the film. Final renunciation (turning off the projector) is earned by prior psychometry beats and carries quiet cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“brass trembling,” “caged bird”), but the final transformation is asserted more than dramatized; we see her hands move “on their own” rather than a conscious, costly choice that seals the path. The contradiction between doubt and surrender is present yet compressed, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hollow’s interiority is spare yet embodied—his fingers brushing the iced lock, the weightless spark against his coat. The contradictory impulses (guard duty vs. spark-cradling) act simultaneously in the final beats, and the cost—abandoning forty years of emptiness for an unknown promise—is felt when the badge rust flakes away. The arc earns its Earned Stasis: he chooses to remember, not to end. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through his rail-bred perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste the shape of ideas”), but the philosopher’s contradictory impulses remain largely poetic rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation of wandering is felt yet causally under-motivated by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—duty to guide vs. need to stay—surfaces in embodied beats (punch pressed into her own palm). The final renunciation is earned: releasing the tool concretely forecloses her old role. Minor slack: the vigil-keepers are sketched more as chorus than crucible, muting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s contradictory fear-of-and-desire-for-sound anchors every beat; bolt choice shows micro-trade-off of safety vs truth. Numb arm nerve-revival is embodied cost foreshadowing acceptance of pain as “real sound.” Final renunciation is earned by prior causality, but silent-choir identity functions more as backstory label than active trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veythas’s interior contradiction—loyalty to Lirien versus duty to the throne—drives every beat; the whispered name is a costly micro-choice that forecloses both friendship and false sovereignty. Embodied emotion (“breath that tasted of dust and old promises”) grounds his stoic mythic stature in palpable grief. The final kneeling and gathering of shards shows earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. keeper of ancestral memory—drives every micro-choice; the final step onto the road is earned by eleven years of embodied ritual and visible loss of the atlas page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s barefoot defiance and tactile curiosity anchor her; the opera-glasses-as-torch moment crystallizes her awkward certainty into action that rekindles others. Internal contradiction—yearning vs. fear of silence—drives her palm to the stone. The cost is communal: she trades isolation for the burden of reignition. One wing askew indeed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—gardener vs. insurgent, caretaker vs. rule-breaker—are dramatized in the moment she chooses to speak “Rebirth” and split the amber; the cost is the Council’s charge of heresy and her grandson’s initial rejection. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, breath hitching) and avoids label-speak. The final image of her laughing while the vine sings beneath the elder’s boot crystallizes earned change with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—rage toward tourists vs. need for stillness—are embodied in the palm-sting and photograph release; the final micro-choice to prune the living wood earns the Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic, though the “quiet talent” label is slightly ornamental. Motivation holds steady under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to broken frames while choosing to become the canvas—is embodied in micro-choices (gathering, redesigning, releasing the box). The final renunciation costs her identity as artist and is foreshadowed by every earlier hesitation; no unmotivated leap.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s serene anger is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb on drone, ink on earth, fist closing—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction (hunt vs understand) is dramatized when he chooses to follow rather than kill, paying the cost of stepping into the dark. The albino trait is more label than lived experience, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (compliance vs. truth) are dramatized in concrete micro-choices—tracing the ledger, hesitating, inputting the flood command—each with escalating cost. Her interiority is embodied (pulse scandalizing the hush) and her final smile under gunfire crystallizes Earned Stasis. The “bravely conflicted” trait is not label-only; it visibly constrains and then enables the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—stay to protect the roses vs. flee as her father urged—are embodied in the thorn-prick and the knife that carves bark instead of flesh. The micro-choice of tying the sandbag scrap to the sapling crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: she forfeits escape for continuity. Interiority is concrete and specific, though the father’s voice edges toward summary rather than dramatized memory. The final stance is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Contradictory interior pulls appear (grief vs practiced cool, duty vs release) and are embodied; the final choice—to let the daughter’s final echo drown—is earned from a chain of refusals that visibly foreclose a path, exacting a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lydia’s contradictory impulses—inheritance loyalty vs. truth—are dramatized in the ledger beats; the final choice to run the story costs her father’s legacy and is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (ink-stained fingers, fogged dome) and avoids label-speak. The caretaker’s brief presence supplies status pressure that nudges her downstairs, satisfying on-page character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s contradictory drives—her wish to silence old grief clashing with an irrepressible need to witness it—are rendered in embodied ache and micro-decisions (feeding the paper, touching the amber, choosing ink again). Her shame manifests in trembling hands, a cracked relic, and the final needle, making her moment-by-moment choices legible and costly without resorting to therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s interior contradiction—whimsy as mask for fatalism—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (ear to flake, hand in void). The final “Always” renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain: flake burn → chorus spill → village complicity made legible. Cost is visible: flake dissolves, mandala reconfigures, path foreclosed. Social-perceptive trait is dramatized, not labeled, and drives the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and particular; the “surgeon’s precision” and “heretic’s compassion” are dramatized through tactile mosaicking and the micro-choice to speak each name. The contradiction between mercy and steel is lived in the final kneel with the commander. One slip: the phrase “grief, too, could be a weapon” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lydia’s contradictory impulses—her ache to perform versus her role as unseen guide—are embodied in the synesthetic orchard and the coin’s anxious rub. The final bow, though quiet, costs her visibility and re-anchors her to endless waiting, a credible renunciation. Elias’s shift from suicide to forward motion is earned by the visceral visions she threads for him. Interiority stays specific, never lapsing into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s skepticism and affection are embodied in micro-choices—wiping palms, kissing the cat, pressing the sliver to her temple—rather than labels. The interior contradiction between fear and longing is active in every beat. The final renunciation (paint first, door later) carries a visible cost: the sliver dissolves into her skin, foreclosing innocence. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between preservation and rebellion is dramatized through micro-choices (touching the fossil, stepping into rain). The final renunciation—becoming the planet’s voice—carries visible cost (abandoning stasis safety) and is earned by prior sensory mapping. Minor slip: “factually mystical” feels like authorial label rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with buttons and time is embodied in tactile micro-choices—threading the needle, loosening the wax seal—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the button on the well’s rim) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he accepts that the hourglass will turn backward and the cliffs may still fall. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Only the traveler’s single spoken line feels slightly expository, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. daring—are dramatized in the pillbox beat and crystallize in her final step; the cost (leaving the empty box) is felt. Interiority is embodied and specific (“silvered stains of a hundred fires”). The ally’s brief presence supplies relational pressure that alters her stance. Minor slip: the ally’s dialogue is slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Coachman’s interiority is embodied (“pulse quickening,” “parchment burning”) and his micro-choice to cross is rooted in decade-long discipline; the girl’s gift of the needle crystallizes a cost, though the merchant remains a functional prop.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is textured and embodied; the potter’s contradictory impulses—returning to ruin yet shaping hope—are dramatized through micro-choices (pressing glass into wet clay, leaving the bowl). Motivation stays consistent and intensifies to the final renunciation. Cost is felt in the act of leaving the glowing bowl behind, but the beat is slightly under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breath misting, thumb bleeding, soil pressed. Contradictory impulses (tending vs. guarding) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to “let herself believe” is earned by the gauge-tooth exchange and the seedling’s defiant break. Cost is visible: the blood offering and the relinquished lock.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses—guilt over ancestral extinction and his refusal to keep apologizing—are dramatized in the sundial moment; the final letting-go is earned by the feather-offering beat and carries visible cost (loss of the bird, opening of the door). Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. Only the bird’s agency is slightly under-motivated, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her hesitation over the spiral, the second spiral pulled from pocket—yet the “inevitably whimsical” label is asserted rather than embodied in choice. The final micro-choice (placing her own letter) crystallizes a cost, but the trait itself never complicates tactics. Secondary characters apply only ambient pressure; relationship crucible not in play.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s cautious hope is embodied in trembling fingers and calibrated dials; her contradictory impulses—risk vs. institutional exile—play out in real time. The micro-choice to transmit subsonics costs her plausible deniability and any return to academic grace, a visible price. Secondary characters appear only as distant reverberations, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority is specific and unflinching.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s claustrophobia and inherited compass create credible internal friction; the final choice to transfix the table and accept the city’s remaking is earned by prior dread and filial legacy. The moment his gloved hand recoils from the cold stone shows embodied fear colliding with need. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Interiority stays concrete and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impetus—the cold method against the pull of buried empathy—simultaneously act inside the quarry scene; his micro-choice to speak Liora’s name and pocket the sketch charges the final renunciation. The face-blind “portraitist of the invisible” reads specific and lived; no therapeutic self-diagnostics intrude. Closure cost: carrying guilt that cannot be remedied yet compels the next case.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for ancestral vindication vs. fear of the Maw—are embodied in trembling fingers and the humming nail. The final choice to burn the journal is earned by the prior vision of Orin and the felt cost of irreversible exile. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the brief Liora exchange lacks full crucible pressure, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—surface in the tactile handling of the glass flake and the decision to pocket it. The embodied shiver when the flake pulses and the deliberate step toward the rippling asphalt crystallize his shift from observer to participant. Cost is legible: he forfeits the known world for an unwritten path. Yet the interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction, blurring the hierarchy of values at the exact moment of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—thief’s reflex vs philosopher’s restraint—surface in tactile beats (touching the lira, tracing the cage bars). His micro-choice to pocket the bill and walk away crystallizes a renunciation that carries visible cost: he forfeits both the loot and the compulsion to keep running. Interiority stays embodied and character-specific; the father’s whispered spiral line is the only near-slip toward diagnostic speak but is offset by Elias’s immediate physical response. The final beat earns its stasis because every prior image (lion cage, foreign bills, cigarette ember) converges on the same question of ownership vs release.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, breath fogging glass—but the shift from solitary recorder to communal thread feels slightly under-motivated; the decisive “I witness” moment arrives more by epiphany than by earned contradiction. His flaw (hoarding words) is dramatized, yet the cost of releasing them is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eldrin’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs. dread of it—are embodied in the pulsing seed and the steady hand that plants it; the final renunciation (“let the silence win”) is earned by the revealed cost of knowing. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the brother’s on-page presence is brief, limiting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—yearning to un-eclipse the covenant yet fearing her own scars—drives every beat; the final “silver leaf blooming from the oldest scar” crystallizes her earned change with visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in her visionary flaw: she listens too late. Micro-choices (pressing the clipping to her wrist, running the root-bridge) are embodied and irreversible. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“root-bound visionary”) that momentarily abstracts the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. fierce gentleness—are dramatized in the needle-stitching beat and the surrender of the child’s name; the final quiet eyes show earned cost. Veyra’s single on-page appearance supplies external pressure that crystallizes Liora’s stance. Interiority stays embodied and specific, avoiding label-speak. The change is credible and forecloses return to prior guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liam’s contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while insulating with facts—are embodied in the tactile handling of the grille cloth and the micro-choice to pocket it. The final renunciation of certainty is earned by the widow’s flinch and the quarry’s indifference, costing him the safety of detachment. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the foreman’s dialogue feels generic, slightly flattening status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief-driven obsession and methodical temperament are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing glyphs, climbing the branch). The final “reestablishing” moment crystallizes his arc with visible cost—he can visit but not stay—earning the shift. Interiority stays concrete; only the late “spirit as hypothesis” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—ritual mastery vs. the creel’s refusal to be solved—drives every beat; the final refusal to inscribe the woman crystallizes his stance with felt cost. Yet the woman remains a cipher; her motives never press him, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“fingers trembled,” “heart was full of names”), but motivation to “dissolve the walls” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene, so the final choice feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to keep mapping—are embodied in the tremor of his hands and the taped bellows; the final right-turn renunciation is earned by the graffiti trail and the sister’s remembered accusation, carrying visible cost in the cracked-earth bed of the Blackthorn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath curling like ink”), but the dreamer’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the confidence man’s off-stage presence limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—contract versus conscience—is embodied in micro-choices (hovering hand, breath fogging, telescope counterweight). The final renunciation is earned by prior plant-telepathy and coffee-prophecy beats; cost is visible in thorns and starlight. One slip: “she wasn’t a musician” is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s dual vocation grounds every beat; the chip-touch at temple is a micro-choice that visibly costs her calm. Interiority stays embodied—her ribs “curl” the dead woman’s message, not her thoughts. Motivation (carry the spark) intensifies through the mirror-door scene, culminating in earned renunciation of fear. No contradictory impulses on page, but the flaw/competence balance tilts toward serene mastery, muting struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maren’s interiority is embodied and specific—rough hands, cold hairpin, the hollow carved by screams. The final choice to give the silver fruit to the arsonist is earned by her spiral-shaped grief and the shoot’s dissolution into her veins. The only cap is that the man’s presence is off-stage until the final beat, limiting relationship-as-crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—absorbing guilt yet fearing his own shadow—drives every beat; the embodied unhooking of knots is a visceral micro-choice that forecloses his old role. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: he lets the lens gather dust, trading certainty for shared vulnerability. Secondary pressure from the woman is brief but sufficient to shift status. Only the “sincerely insincere” label is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his body softening, orchard memory tasting of plums—yet the reversal of age is asserted more than embodied in choice; the final renunciation to “let the rings teach” is earned but the cost is diffuse rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is textured and consistent; the arrowhead against the sternum is a charged micro-choice repeated with rising urgency. Final “he was the stone” crystallizes a credible renunciation, but the self-as-tower beat is slightly abstract and could use one more physical cue to feel fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Internal contradiction is sharp: Marlin’s candle vs the Conservatory’s “perfection by button.” The garden scene converts his earlier failure into deliberate refusal—cost enacted when he whispers “Louder.”

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession with “the color of sound” is embodied in every micro-choice—wading into the shallows, pocketing the key tag, lighting the final lantern—so the renunciation at the end carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The only cap is that the faceless figure’s dialogue is slightly expository, nudging the epiphany rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora's inner drive is textured—her pattern obsession, fear of oblivion, and silent self-accusation all surface in bodily cues (trembling hand, fogged glass). The renunciation to "turn around" is credible because it is built on prior embodied choices with the coins and static, not an epiphany. Minor: the “madness” accusation is reported rather than dramatized, muting relational crucible. Overall, interior contradiction and embodied stakes satisfy the single-character depth expected at 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reaper’s contradictory impulse—collecting fears to give them shape while knowing the act will unleash them—drives every beat; the crystallizing of terrors into named monsters is embodied, costly, and irreversible. Interiority is specific (“hollow so he could carry others’ grief”), but the final renunciation—tucking the atlas into his ribcage and walking on—earns its weight. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority—the trembling fingers, the breath catching when the bell weeps—embeds a clear hierarchy of values (“today, it was enough”) and shows the cost of his stubborn belief. The story earns the arc from “labelled earnestly naive” to “he had spoken the language”; his vow to rebuild trust, with fingers still bleeding, seals the transformation at personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—guard the past vs. release it—are embodied in micro-choices (nailing vs. burning photos). The final renunciation is earned by the trail of images and the scent of the liqueur; cost is the literal ashes of memory. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One slip: “he wanted to feed it” edges toward label-speak before the image rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is sensuous and specific—the auburn-haired alchemist’s “hands trembled, not from fear, but from the weight of what she was about to lose” shows embodied, contradictory emotion with earned cost. Sentimentality is both declared (“secretly sentimental”) and demonstrated in the peach-sugar memory that must be surrendered. The micro-choice of tilting the crystal toward fire crystallizes value hierarchy—wonder held, not solved—with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty to the payload vs. the corrosion of secrecy—are embodied in the buckle’s weight and her whispered revision of her mentor’s lesson. Micro-choices (left-right-pause-twist, silent refusal to answer the radio) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—leaving only boot-prints and spores—earns its stasis through prior causality. One hairline slip: the phrase “pattern seeker” is label-speak that never becomes dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory halves—jar-bound and embodied—generate immediate, embodied tension; the micro-choice to bleed onto both jars crystallizes his hierarchy of values (wholeness over legal survival). Veyra’s pressure sharpens the crucible, forcing a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though the “defeat the numbness” line edges toward label-speak, blunting full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s quiet persistence and refusal to monetize the flower root the story; his micro-choice to replant rather than display the seed crystallizes the thematic arc. Lina’s receptivity is shown, not told, through her tilted listening and return alone. The final hand-squeeze carries understated relational cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven caretaking vs. self-erasure—are embodied in the blower’s pull cord and the trembling fingers that finally set it down. The interior arc from “mournfully eager” conductor to listener who renounces control is earned by the on-page cost of the blower’s death-rattle and his climb toward real laughter. Minor slip: the household’s instant acceptance feels slightly frictionless, blunting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyssa’s contradictory impulses—guard vs. release—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the book, pocketing the pendant, handing it over). The final renunciation costs her the only identity she had; the ache in her teeth and the “hungry cold” give visceral stakes. One slip: “they were shouting” is summary, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority—"stole because the crozier’s ruin mirrored his own"—anchors motivation in embodied shame, not labels. Contradictory impulses (renounce vs prove) act simultaneously as he feeds memories and doubt into the serpent’s crack. Micro-choice to whisper forbidden incantation crystallizes the hierarchy of values under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers brushing the fragment, breath hitching, bones humming—yet the final leap feels slightly under-motivated; the reversal of gravity is asserted rather than earned by prior contradiction. The mentor’s teaching is sketched rather than dramatized, so the “unlearning” method arrives as thematic statement rather than lived flaw. Still, her micro-choices (pressing the shard, pocketing it again) track cleanly with motive and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s embodied pragmatism (“calloused fingers,” “oil-stained vest”) and her contradictory calm under existential threat create a vivid, specific interiority; her micro-choice to kneel and feed the hourglass is earned by prior causal hints and visibly costs her the grotto route. The lone ghost passenger functions only as atmospheric foil, so relationship crucible is minimal, but Lira’s self-contradictory stance—accepting impermanence while desperately stitching timelines—drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’ interior contradiction—his compulsion to dissolve ownership of memories versus the personal price each weave exacts—is specific and embodied in the sinew thread. One micro-choice—handing the thread into the void—is pivotal to the RR. The woman functions more as philosophical mirror than second character; her presence doesn’t meaningfully complicate Elias’ status but allows a crisp voiced echo. No deeper interior contradiction surfaces after the eruption, so the final “Again?” feels slightly foregone rather than earned under escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elira’s hunger to learn star-navigation is vivid—“they use edges not the dark” grounds the desire in craft; the mentor/learner friction with Kael supplies tension; one more contradiction inside her (awe vs parental guilt) seen in gesture would cinch excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s curiosity and compulsion to listen are embodied in the frayed hearing-aid and the choice to follow the dead’s whisper; the moment he kneels and sees his own child-self crystallizes a credible, costly shift from detached observer to implicated witness. Interiority is specific—his breath “shallow,” the glove “faded to gray”—but the final recognition (“his child”) arrives with minimal prior internal contradiction, blunting the full force of contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s fear of small spaces is stated but never embodied; the “distant scream” of claustrophobia is the only nod. His decision to cross the phase seam is credible because the codex key and detector spike give immediate cause, yet we never feel the internal contradiction between terror and curiosity. The final renunciation—returning for “the quiet things”—is stated rather than dramatized, so the cost is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—clinging to a bureaucratic ghost while yearning for cosmic repair—is embodied in the porcelain shard and the heartbeat count. The final sync with the observatory’s pulse is earned by prior micro-choices (pulling the files, accepting the ink’s offer) and carries visible cost: she renounces correcting her death certificate, accepting a shared heartbeat instead. The shard’s shift from sharp to warm literalizes the change. No relationship crucible is on page, but single-POV interiority is specific and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Veyra’s hunger to translate is vivid, but her interiority drifts into summary (“she understood too late”) rather than embodied contradiction at the climax; the copper-veined trait is ornamental until the final line, never constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s bitterness and sister-loss motive are vivid, embodied in tactile micro-choices (digging loam, pocketing arrowhead). The final metamorphosis is earned by prior refusal to heed warnings and escalating stakes. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: the herbalist’s status/power remains abstract, so relationship-as-crucible is only hinted.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Protagonist’s contradictory need—to revive wonder yet fear of discovery—lives in trembling bow and heart-signalling. Embodied emotion (“her own chest that had also been waiting”) and micro-choice (shell pressed to breastbone) anchor motivation; final renunciation (walking into the grove, violin resting) shows visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; flaw (fatalistic resignation transformed into hope) alters final decision credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior drive—“deliver the storm to absences, then to the next alley”—rings true and threads every beat; the storm bottle becomes a lens on his refusal to quit. Lira’s foster-work shows a second, mirrored flaw that refracts Elias’s choice and costs her the last flicker of hope. The arc lands in a credible Earned Stasis: he walks straight through the drone shadow because he has already accepted he can never stop. Minor: the “respectfully rebellious” label is voiced rather than dramatized once, blunting the micro-choice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior's taciturn interiority is rendered in textured, embodied detail ("calloused hands", "fragments of gold leaf"); his silence is not a trait but a choice that narrows tactics and carries an earned cost when the final renunciation crystallizes. The woman's pressure reveals no generic backstory—she's a catalyst who reframes possibility without overwriting his arc. One minor slip: the phrase "interpret silence not as absence, but as a space..." edges toward analytic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—spectacle-adjusting, scarf-touching, chalk-tasting tea—but the decisive shift from hoarder to “fold in the story” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost (loneliness cured) is felt yet slightly under-cooked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with the ghosts of ink”), but the decisive renunciation (“Stay”) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is present yet abstract. The librarian’s contradictory impulses—archival order vs. dream empathy—are dramatized in the final beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interior contradiction—rule against opening vs. magnetic pull of the hair—drives every beat; her micro-choice to “listen” instead of pick crystallizes the arc. Embodied emotion (“hair pulsed warm as a living thing”) anchors stakes. Final renunciation (“letting the locked thing decide”) costs her certainty and earns stasis. Minor slip: the man’s motivation stays off-page, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’ curiosity and dread entwine in embodied hesitation—knees in black water, thumb on mushroom gills—until the final choice to press the ring to his temple costs “his own life press down on him.” Interior contradiction and micro-choice drive the turn with credible renunciation; flaw and struggle remain intact, no therapy-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elspeth’s interiority—her deliberate slowness, the shard-mirror habit—embodies contradiction and stakes; Kael’s tremor and tea-trace reveal doubt under pressure. Their mentor/apprentice status shift is staged through micro-choices (mirror shard, cup swirl) that foreclose retreat. Cost is felt: the shadow’s lunge and Elspeth’s withheld truth about “the cost of coming back.” Minor slip: Kael’s interiority drifts toward label-speak (“What if I get it wrong?”) before it’s embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s hunger to shape the unseen is embodied in tactile pruning gestures and the seed’s pulse; the contradictory pull between keeping wonder and passing it through crystallizes in the final cut. The girl’s brief presence forces a choice that costs Elias his rooted life—an earned renunciation. Interiority stays specific and sensory; no diagnostic self-talk. Only the girl remains slightly generic, muting crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—restorer vs releaser—drives every micro-choice; the moment he lets the needle drop embodies the cost of renouncing his inherited role. Embodied emotion (“rough with disuse”) and the bracelet of threads mark a visible, irreversible change. The flaw (belief in mending) complicates the climax and is confronted, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile handling of lenses, parchment, and reels shows a map-maker’s precision—but the final “quiet certainty” arrives with minimal embodied cost; we feel her shift more as insight than forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s analytic detachment and grief-anchored restraint are embodied in micro-choices—nudging the globe, pocketing the notebook, choosing silence—each carrying visible cost. The final renunciation (“let go of the need to know”) is earned by prior beats that show her habitual compulsion to chase last transmissions. Interior contradiction surfaces when the analytic mind confronts the impossible snow; the moment is specific, not diagnostic. The sister photograph and the withheld report crystallize the personal stake without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The balladeer’s contradictory impulse—yearning to give voice yet choosing silence—drives every beat; the bolt-plate burn and final rest symbol crystallize the cost of refusal. Interiority is embodied (“hands empty, throat raw”) rather than labeled. Only the grandmother memory drifts toward summary, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is specific—her patient unfolding of the diary mirrors her climb; the embodied warmth of the diary against her chest crystallizes her shift from seeing the spire as prison to lens. The final laugh carries earned cost: years of cold accepted for clarity. Minor slip: “warmly inquisitive” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s grief-driven obsession with “categorizing clouds by emotion” is embodied and specific; the moment he lets the string snap without fighting it crystallizes his contradictory impulse to surrender to memory. The final fall-into-sky choice is earned by prior interior stakes and carries visible cost—he forfeits safety for reunion. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, though a few phrases skirt poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the contradiction between “hands remember” and “likeness always slipped” drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—letting the coin fall—earns its cost through prior obsession with containment. One minor slip: “she understood” is a touch declarative amid otherwise visceral cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Liora’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing charts, brushing grit, charcoal sketch) and drives every beat; the final grin and steady hand show earned change. Captain Veyra’s single on-page beat supplies credible status pressure that shifts to respect. Interior contradiction (rule-breaking vs wonder) stays active in scene. Cost is visible: Liora accepts future discipline for the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the ache for “that precise click” grounds motive. The sister-loss backstory is compressed yet causally tied to the final reach into the mirror. Micro-choices (kneeling, scattering gears, whispering to a stubborn tooth) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is felt when the child dissolves and the hall shudders—loss of the reflection that might have been the sister.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory pull between wanting Kael to stay and knowing he might leave is dramatized in the final beat. Kael’s ghostly flicker-to-solid arc is consistent and character-specific. The collective effort is credibly earned through her micro-choices (ringing the bell, writing “We stay”). Minor slip: Kael’s death details remain abstract, blunting the cost of his presence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—preserve the world vs. release stolen time—are dramatized in the trembling decision to insert the puppet head; the cost (his own erasure) is embodied in the final slack fingers and stopped clock. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinching. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—refusing pleas yet relenting for the girl—drives every beat; the nut-press ritual embodies her reluctant caretaker ethos with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“key warm from her fingers”) grounds motive without label-speak. Final renunciation (last nut left at entrance) forecloses her own escape path, earned by thirteen years of pattern-learning.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—grief as cold water in boots, polymer chains as memory lattice. The contradictory impulse to build vs. dissolve is dramatized in the micro-choice of wading in rather than constructing. The final renunciation carries visible cost: he forfeits the chrysalis and the last physical trace of his sister. Only the girl’s voice feels slightly generic, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Liora’s motive—she “hopes to be the one who finds the cracks stories slip through rather than the one writing them”—is clearly conveyed, but the interior contradiction between her stated passivity and her active trading remains implied rather than dramatized. Emotions feel embodied in the tactile contact with tools and moonlight, yet her final stance is more stance crystallization than personal renunciation; cost is conceptual (she refrains from opening her own vial) but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his compulsion to absorb others’ remorse versus his need to purge it—are dramatized in the tactile act of pouring the vial; the embodied cost (tongue finally “clean”) seals the arc. Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids label-speak. The single on-page micro-choice (kneeling, pouring, watching the face dissolve) reconfigures his stance and forecloses further drowning in the soldier’s guilt. No relationship crucible is required; the pavilion itself supplies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—spectacles warm from rehearsal, ribs echoing voices—yet her decisive empathy is asserted rather than embodied in a costly micro-choice. Elias’s shift from accusation to collaboration is sketched more than dramatized; the bottle and weight are handled, but the emotional pivot feels compressed. Still, the librarian’s vocation and flaw (over-functioning peacemaker) are consistent and drive the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. the ache to reclaim lost intimacies—are dramatized through her trembling calibration of the mirror and the physical cost of nanite intrusion. The final shift from engineer to “cartographer of the entangled dark” is earned by prior causal choices and carries visible bodily and existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysara’s prism-mind, grief for her brother, and the final choice to plant the seed are embodied and contradictory; the smudged thumbprint and glowing seed crystallize her cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. Motivation escalates from deciphering to reentering, each step rooted in prior causality. The earned stasis—renouncing speech to the elders—carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief‐riven empathy drives every micro-choice—the porcelain insulator is pressed, the ear pressed, the cracks strummed—but the interiority drifts toward lyrical exposition; contradictory impulses (need to free the sculpture versus fear of reopening pain) show mainly in summary rather than in scene. His “tree-song” vocation constrains tactics well, yet the final renunciation (leaving the insulator behind) feels lightly earned because external pressure never truly tests an alternative course.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interiority is convincingly specific—worn dent, thirteen-year exile, and a lived reluctance to “play at all when the stakes are invisible”—but the daughter never rises beyond prop-level innocence; their status dynamic lacks pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—pacifist empathy vs. the need to act—drives every beat; the trembling hand over the sketch and the final “Silence repaired here” sign crystallize a credible renunciation with visible cost. Backstory is kept within BRR limits and always tilts present tactics. Only the off-stage guild fire feels slightly convenient, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s hunger for serenity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—stealing, planting, pressing the petal—each aligning with her olfactory gift and yielding a credible renunciation. Interior contradiction (craving stillness yet embracing sway) is dramatized, not labeled. The final cost—public exposure of private grief via the flower’s mirror—lands with felt social price. Minor slip: “reckless” vs “precise” tension is asserted more than shown in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Veyra’s interiority and motive remain consistent; the shift from pilot to gardener is credibly embodied through her micro-choice of cradling the sapling. The contradiction—“I’m here to chart, but now I must plant”—is dramatized in body and tool use. Still, the absence of any second on-page character prevents relational crucible testing, and emotional calibration is almost lyrically perfect, lacking genuine messy mis-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veyra’s interior contradiction—data-driven resolve vs. intuitive dread—is embodied in the frayed patch and the vibrating container; her micro-choice to strike the flare costs her the patch and the anemometer, foreclosing the old self. The moment she writes “Listen” crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic perception is embodied in “colors coiled around her wrists, warm as living things.” The contradiction between obedience and liberation is dramatized in each chime. The final renunciation (“She had given the world back its voice”) is earned and carries visible cost: the elders’ authority is shattered, the cavern’s silence melted. Only the elders remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal conflict—duty to seal vs doubt that the weave wants opening—remains embodied in the frost-numb hand that still lifts the flute. A thirty-year flaw (certainty as shield) shatters when the child’s echo asks “What if you’re wrong?”, driving Elias’s last step across the threshold; the cost (eternal anonymity, surrendered role) is legible in the uncased flute and breathing mountains.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—collector vs. conduit—drives every beat; the moment he lets the borrowed grief flood him (“the widow’s voice dissolve…”) is a costly, earned pivot. The flaw (emotional parasitism) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final renunciation carries visible price. Minor slip: the blacksmith and child are off-page, so status dynamics bullet is moot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courier’s trembling fingers and lingering in villages reveal a believable interior contradiction—fear versus duty. His final kneeling to plant the seed crystallizes a credible renunciation of the mentor quest in favor of stewardship, with the cost of vanishing into the fade. The woman’s pressure forces a micro-choice: accept the hum or remain a passive seeker. Voice remains distinct, though the mentor’s backstory is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Attentive-mystic characterization is consistently rooted in embodied micro-choices (palm to frost, knees hit earth), interior contradiction clear in rejecting belief yet searching for echoes; renunciation earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spinner’s interiority is embodied in trembling fingers and breath-fogged air; her contradictory impulses—yearning versus renunciation—surface in the moment she cracks the bead with her teeth. Motivation remains consistent and escalates to the final choice to stay while the tapestry departs. The Earned Stasis (she remains, bones woven into roots) carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by the orchard’s patient absorption. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The smith’s interior contradiction—meekness vs. the slow-burn will—is embodied in the deliberate feeding of silk and the palm-to-stone moment. His choice to listen rather than “fix” enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost (spent silk, forever-changed world). One minor dip: the phrase “the right to try again” tilts toward thematic summary. Otherwise, micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Liora’s sensory-mapping interiority is vivid and specific; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs caution) act simultaneously. The final choice to step through the seam is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost: she relinquishes the familiar map for an open-ended weave. Secondary character pressure is minimal—only the man’s half-remembered voice—so relationship crucible is not tested. The flaw of compulsive seeking is dramatized and confronted, not merely labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence, ritual with the glass, and final decision to stay are embodied in tactile micro-choices; the contradictory pull between isolation and inherited guardianship is dramatized through stone-stacking and letter-burning. Interiority stays concrete—“glass warm as a pulse”—and the renunciation of the skiff carries visible cost. One slip: the mother memory is summary rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. dread—are embodied in her tactile handling of the wick and the weaponized laughter; the final renunciation (“You can’t have it”) carries visible cost in the dwindling flame and her print-less descent. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only drag is a brief “she understood now” summary that edges toward epiphany-speak, blunting the full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the heart’s foreign rhythm and the ache in the market square anchor motive. Micro-choices—pinning the wing, painting the first stroke—are character-specific and escalate stakes. Final renunciation (silence as invitation) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: traveler’s “watchful” label is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his stinging hands, the tear-tracked cheeks—but the final renunciation (returning the sorrow to the trees) is more asserted than dramatized; we see the choice but not the immediate cost on him, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her bleeding fingers, the terror of singing, the decades of memory-gathering all anchor motive. The final renunciation (becoming the song) is earned by her embodied pain and the orchard’s hunger. No contradictory impulses are dramatized mid-scene, so the arc feels slightly smoothed rather than torn, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is textured—her guilt over Voss and her tactile empathy for unread books are embodied, not labeled. The contradiction between hiding and “leaving breadcrumbs” is dramatized when she presses the bookcase and chooses to lock the door. Cost is visible: twelve years of self-exile traded for an unlocked future. Only the final beat of “answering with the turning of a page” edges toward abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s “heuristically gentle” trait seeds every micro-choice—planting mint, pressing crumbs, handing the prince bread—so the final renunciation (silence, shared wheat) feels earned. Interiority is embodied and specific (“steam rising…like a memory she couldn’t place”). The only gap: the prince’s on-page interiority is absent, so the relationship crucible is inferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s meticulousness and quiet desperation are embodied in the slide’s tremor and the misted ledger; the final step onto the bridge is a renunciation of his life’s work, paid for by the library’s collapse. Interior contradiction surfaces when he pockets the warm slide—an unscientific gesture that betrays hope. The woman’s face and voice supply the relational crucible absent earlier, crystallizing his shift from archivist to seeker. The cost is the library itself, now stardust.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—vengeance and restraint—are embodied in the silent fob and the withheld knife; her final renunciation of violence carries visible cost as the harbor claims Veyne. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and micro-choices (letting the fob dangle, laughing softly) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The only drag is a touch of competence smoothing: she never missteps, which blunts flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—refusing belief until the compass burns her—drives every beat; embodied taste and trembling petals externalize emotion. The final laugh and step into stormhood crystallize a credible renunciation of skepticism with visible cost (loss of the ring, loss of prior self). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (kneeling, licking lips, reaching) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—gifted memory as curse—drives every micro-choice; the lock and paint tubes externalize his hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of monochrome safety is earned by prior embodied struggle. Minor slip: “mnemonically gifted” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s allergy to dishonesty is embodied in physical symptoms that force his choices; the final renunciation—writing ungilded truth—pays the cost of abandoning his lifelong craft. Interiority is specific, tactile, and contradictory; the moment he presses the zinc plate to the pedestal crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single POV remains coherent and flawed. The earned stasis is credible, though the jump from “I can’t lie” to “I will bleed truth” could be micro-sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her muteness, tactile ritual with the ice, and final smile all reveal motive and cost. The contradiction between preserving wonder and destroying the ice is dramatized, not stated. Yet the absence of any second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias-7’s contradictory impulses—protect vs. destroy—are embodied in the static glitch and the box; the final choice to burn and leave is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (ash, new caretaker). Interiority is concrete and specific to an android’s sensorium (“metal fingers brushing,” “diaphragm hitched”). The micro-choice of tucking a bloom behind his auditory sensor crystallizes the arc without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—dusty fingers, pulse quickening—but her decisive act (opening the locket and mailbox) is more ritual than crucible; the cost is communal catharsis rather than personal loss, so the renunciation feels gentle, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to decipher versus readiness to relinquish—surfaces in the dice roll and the final dance, each micro-choice (palm on console, upward kick) carrying visible cost; the shift from theft to release is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Contradictory impulses—need to recover vs. truth of extraction—are vivid, but the loss-renunciation lacks visceral embodiment on the final dock; we watch him pour away the means rather than himself. Interiority is concrete yet never over-explains. Final choice is earned but the price reads abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (yearning for silence yet fearing its cost) play out in micro-choices—pressing the wing to water, lunging for the thread. The final renunciation of solitude is earned by the prior failure and the visible burn on her hand. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s hunger to “understand” his inherited building and his readiness to lie about a sugar loan are clearly motivated, but Veyra’s opacity drags the score: a “dead tutor” who never bleeds, tires, or betrays a genuine fear reads more archetype than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s skepticism-to-belief arc is embodied in micro-choices (testing soil, pressing shell to ear) and culminates in the irreversible archive act; the cost—emptied chest, inevitable arrest—lands with felt weight. Interiority is specific (“laugh she’d smothered… shade of light through the library window”) and avoids label-speak. The final smile shows earned contradiction: emptied yet radiant. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The forger’s contradictory impulses—treason vs forgiveness—are embodied in the tremor of his fingers and the final shared kneel; the Emperor’s shift from tyrant to penitent is credible because the ink-dissolving act forces both men to confront the cost of their pasts. Micro-choices (pressing the thorn, guiding the Emperor’s hand) reveal a hierarchy of values in real time. The earned stasis of teaching the new script carries visible emotional cost. No slips in motivation or interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s contradictory drive—hunger for truth vs. fear of its cost—remains embodied in every micro-choice (pressing the shell, stepping to the drop, singing the nexus). The final renunciation (hurling the shell) is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost: silence replaces echo. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the brief “why do some of us echo?” line edges toward label-speak, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the locket while guiding others to release—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing palms to glass, tracing ice). The final renunciation of her mother’s accusation is earned by the widow’s catharsis and carries visible cost: Lena stays alone among the murmuring dead. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “supposed to let go” edges toward label-speak but is immediately undercut by action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elder Kael’s quiet authority and Liora’s tentative curiosity are embodied in micro-gestures (whisk stirring, mimicked whistle), but Kael’s interior contradiction is muted; the “hidden effort” motive is stated more than dramatized. The final hand-off of the whisk to Liora crystallizes a credible endurance/renunciation with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s skeptical drive is embodied in micro-choices—piecing letters, tasting fruit, kneeling to the diamond—culminating in the earned inversion from debunker to willing conduit. The contradiction between his career-long disbelief and final surrender is dramatized, not stated. The cost—his dissolution—is legible in the heartbeat-fruit left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—listening vs. speaking—drives every beat; the final act of hurling the receiver through the portico crystallizes his shift from passive needle to active hand with visible cost (loss of static voices). Motivation stays rooted in his trait of hearing futures in radio cracks, and embodied emotion (shaking hands, jagged smile) grounds the arc. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“prophets weren’t born; they were assembled”) that slightly abstracts the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradictions—clinging to jars while aching for release—are embodied in micro-choices: opening the jar, offering the child the box, accepting the single imperfect note. Flaw and fear compel higher stakes choices that escalate to a renunciation that forecloses hoarding. The cost is palpable on the page, crystallized in the tremble he feels “for the first time in years” and in the decision to “set it playing” rather than repair and cage.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“her molars ache,” “blood hummed”), but the final sacrifice feels slightly pre-explained rather than discovered under pressure; the contradiction between logic and emotion is stated more than dramatized in the moment of turning the key.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lior’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his ear to the viaduct, the frost on his cheeks—but the sister’s off-stage accusation is the only external pressure; no second character on the page to test status. The final step onto the rising bridge is earned by thirteen winters of moon-tracking, so the renunciation of fire-brand urgency carries visible cost. Still, the contradiction between “coward” and “revolutionary” is asserted more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias's conflicting drive—paternal legacy versus institutional complicity—is shown through tactile micro-choices (hands on tiles, racing to archives) rather than told. “They’re flooding…erasing them” crystallizes interior contradiction. His father's adage loops as active guilt, not sermon. Cost is felt when he runs toward archives despite looming flood, not because of it.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s trembling hands, swallowed apologies, and final resolve form a credible arc; the interior contradiction between mercy as gift vs. craft is embodied in the heart’s ticking. Micro-choices (winding, soldering, sealing envelopes) visibly cost him comfort and old detachment. The shift from waiting for absolution to “making it” is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor slip: the leap from hymn to letter-writing could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pip’s “steadily curious” trait is embodied in her tactile tinkering and repeated crashes; the arrow-tip lodged in her wing and later fused to her chestplate externalizes an internal contradiction—reckless hunger versus iterative craft. Micro-choices (cranking the kaleidoscope, kicking off the bench) align with motive, and the final endurance—“first draft” acceptance—carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her shaking hands, the patch pressed to her chest—but the final surrender reads slightly abstract; we feel the cost more in concept than in body. The contradiction between duty and love is present, yet the pivot from detachment to self-erasure could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his gloved fingers brushing frost, the fragment pulsing against his skin—but the final choice to step onto the ice is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices. The “shadow-laced” trait is shown through effect rather than label, and the contradiction between pacifier and intervenor is present but not pushed to crisis in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lior’s contradictory impulses (rumination vs. reflexive rescue) play out in present-tense beats; her quiet renunciation of suicide feels earned because the dog’s nuzzle and the etched-steel talisman charge the parasol tip’s closure. Flawed interiority is particular to Iceland’s ice hum, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lior’s voice is vivid and layered; contradictory impulses orbit through decision versus endurance under pressure, and the final quiet acceptance earns a resonant closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the half-mask and peripheral awareness feel lived-in. Her choice to endure rather than confront the prophet is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the final image. The contradiction between public mask and private honesty is dramatized in micro-choices, not labels. Minor slip: “strangely honest” is stated rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist's interior contradiction is embodied in the soft "boots barely disturbing," the gentle theft of lavender, and the weight shift from "ache" to "promise." Yet the final micro-choice—the shutter click—reads more symbolic than felt, so the cost is visible but not viscerally stinging.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence and obsession with the crystal are embodied in trembling hands and shallow breath; the final choice to leave the library with the woman is earned by the prior discovery that growth has gone underground. Interior contradiction—yearning for language yet fearing its loss—drives every micro-choice. The woman’s arrival supplies external pressure that crystallizes his renunciation of solitary study. Cost is felt in the suspended quiet he abandons.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his trembling hands, the taste of metal, the chalk’s pulse—yet the “precognitively forgetful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation feels earned because the tape’s hum and the spiral’s glow have been tactile anchors throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile intimacy with broken instruments and his quiet ache of transience are embodied in every beat. The final choice to sync with the spinning hand is earned by a lifetime of mending what others discard, and the cost (letting go of stillness) is felt on the page. Minor slip: the “sage” label is asserted rather than dramatized, but the contradiction between repair and release drives the arc convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lena’s interiority is sharply embodied—her grip on the vinyl shard and micro-choice to drop it both pay decisive roles in the close. Contradictory impulses (kindness that hurts) reveal themselves in beats, not summaries. Earned stasis—the renunciation of seeking cure—costs the character the very music she gives. Dialogue-free yet voice is specific, calm, charged.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—scholarly caution vs. hunger for forbidden knowledge—drive every micro-choice. The final step through the sun is credibly foreshadowed by her grandmother memory and the automaton’s warning, so the cost feels earned. Minor slip: “quietly deliberate” is asserted more than dramatized in the moment of turning the second key.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” trait is embodied in her calm handling of the tooth and the changeling; contradictory impulses (yearning vs. caution) play out in the forehead-press beat. Micro-choice—offering the tooth while holding the needle—reveals hierarchy of values. Closure shows earned cost: she trades certainty for her brother’s return and keeps the humming needle as permanent reminder.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradictory pull between memory and present duty is dramatized in her micro-choice to hand the sea glass to the child. The final renunciation—passing the “pearl of stillness”—is earned and carries visible cost in the relinquishing of sole guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (fingers tracing icicle drips), but her “watchful dreamer” label never collides with an active mistake or contradiction; motives stay consistent yet safe. The gifting of the pendant to Javier is earned, but the internal cost feels muted under lyrical overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory drive—control vs surrender—is embodied in the seashell worry-stone and the manuscript that bleeds new ink; the final dissolution carries visible cost as he “lets the water take him,” foreclosing any return. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic, and micro-choices (pressing shell to lips, writing faster) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Backstory is one brief reflective block that tilts present stance via mother’s dying words, satisfying BRR. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the burn in her throat, the laugh that finally escapes—yet the shift from lifelong avoidance to decisive song feels slightly compressed; one more beat of embodied resistance would have sealed the arc at 9+. Still, her contradictory impulses (safety of stories vs. arbor’s need) play out in real time, and the cost of her renunciation of silence is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the contradiction between preserving light and teaching it to stay crystallizes in the final beat. Motivation is rooted in a lived-in patience that visibly constrains tactics. The renunciation of “the world could keep its endings” is earned and carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is embodied and conflicted; micro-choices (aligning gears to “listen,” pocketing the loose screw) show value hierarchy scaled to length. However, the central shift from fixing to remembering is somewhat internally summarized rather than dramatized under full pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the lamp, the weights in her ribs—but the moment she realizes “I am the loom” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The widow’s interiority is embodied in calloused palms, aching hands, and the refusal to weep; her micro-choice to keep the final carving instead of selling it crystallizes her arc. Motivation—learning to let go—drives every cut and is paid for in the ache of continuation. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she was already half-gone”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments yet refusing to be reclaimed—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (camera wheel to temple, jump into lagoon). The final renunciation carries visible cost as the lagoon “remembers” and pulls her under, foreclosing escape. Ghost-Lira’s taunt crystallizes the internal conflict without overt exposition. Minor: age drift never constrains an on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s “functional creativity” is embodied in every beat—jury-rigging, mapping, repurposing—so the trait feels lived, not labeled. Her contradictory impulse (fix vs. let go) surfaces when she chooses a pedestrian bridge instead of a restored spaceport, paying the cost of lowered horizons. Interiority is concrete and specific to her engineering lens; no stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible social cost (the town gets “through,” not “away”).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the scribe’s “excruciatingly gentle” hands and the micro-choice to let the crystal crack show contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation—abandoning measured time—earns its cost through prior fear and the literal fracture of the forecourt. No stock therapy-speak; misbelief (time must not be counted) is corrected only when the crystal breaks under his palm.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the sundial yet dropping the ledger—are embodied in micro-choices (steering toward marshes, pocketing vs. discarding). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits the map and the auction gold. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. Only the “architecture of lies” phrase edges toward label-speak, but it’s brief.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s patience is embodied in tactile micro-choices (brushing frost, decoding rope) rather than label; the final whisper into the rope is earned cost. Interior motives shift when realization that “archive” demands tending—credible endurance with felt loss. Limiting to one POV, no second character reduces scope to single lens; stakes stay internal and consistent within 800-word frame. Slight reliance on summary phrases like “philosophical seed collector” tags rather than scene-earned contradiction keeps ceiling below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers brushing earth, the thread pulsing like a heartbeat—but the princess remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation (to keep the locket and thread for now) is earned by the preceding sensory communion with absence, and the cost is felt in the garden’s held breath. Flaws are hinted (his voyeuristic intimacy with grief) yet stay safely hedged, preventing full 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aldric’s contradictory impulses—madness vs. method, hope vs. dread—are embodied in the tremor of his fingers and the “quaking certainty” that he is tampering with doom. His interiority is concrete and character-specific, never slipping into diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—embracing a flawed miracle—earns its cost through prior causality and visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s contradictory identity—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—drives every micro-choice; the coin grafted to her coat embodies the tension between destruction and healing. Her embodied reaction to the boy’s wound and her whispered lore show interior conflict in action. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts perpetual village suspicion as the price of compassion. One slip: “unyielding compassion” is named rather than dramatized mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liora's interiority is vividly embodied—her distrust of "luminous" promises and her refusal to wait are shown through the grit she feels when the box hums—but her change of heart near “sidereal patience” appears more declared (“wasn’t waiting... was knowing when to push”) than dramatized by conflicting impulses on the page. The final decision carries felt cost only after the fact; the earlier skepticism feels sharper than the moment she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Veyra’s interiority is vivid—her pulse-synced blooms, the gear’s weight in her palm—but the memory-for-transit trade is declared rather than dramatized; we feel the loss conceptually, not viscerally. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. share) act simultaneously in the final beats, and the choice forecloses return with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is embodied and specific; the chisel-slip and crack crystallize grief in action. The spectral mentorship feels earned within family custom, and the final micro-choice—adding his own poem—carries visible cost. Minor slip: “fiercely meditative” is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—precision as atonement vs. silence as complicity—are embodied in the rake notches and the slowed pendulum; the final micro-choice to carve his own name costs him the council’s wrath and splinters the handle, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak. Only the sister’s backstory is slightly summary, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s gentle fatalism and tactile relationship with the dead feel lived-in; the moment he folds the tapestry back into the case crystallizes his shift from passive listener to active steward of buried truths, paying the cost of complicity. Interiority is concrete and embodied—his throat tightening at the lavender scent anchors memory in body. Motivations remain consistent yet deepen under pressure, culminating in the earned decision to reset the chessboard: a quiet but irreversible stance. Minor slip: the “blithe” label is asserted more than dramatized in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—wanting neither prophecy nor control yet choosing to “coax” the future—drives every micro-choice; the earned hesitation before the first dot shows visible cost and anchors her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s renunciation—leaving the alcove, quill dry—earns its cost through prior beats: the risk of execution, the girl’s arrival as living proof the dust is learning. Interiority stays embodied (“his breath caught,” “inkwell dry like a promise”). The single contradiction—copyist who now creates—drives every choice. Lira’s brief presence still pressures Elias to cede the voice to her, altering their shared state.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is sensuous—“mask’s edges bit deeper as she smiled”—but motive (“to keep the lie beautiful”) is asserted rather than dramatized in choice; the charcoal burn reads more ritual than dilemma, softening cost. Still, Liora’s contradiction—destroying to reveal—threads through embodied detail and shapes every micro-movement, keeping her individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. survival—are embodied in the cog and drive every micro-choice; the final refusal to yield is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as the water rises. Interiority is concrete, character-specific, and avoids therapy-speak. The single on-page relationship (Veyra) applies immediate pressure that alters Elias’s stance. Flaws (stubbornness, pride) complicate choices and are confronted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his tactile attention to the rosette, the “expectantly resigned sigh” memory, and his decision to hum silence rather than melody all reveal layered motives. The four remaining singers are sketched with economical, body-based detail that makes their presence felt under pressure. The final micro-choice—humming the shape of absence—earns the quiet renunciation of “loud” harmony with visible cost. Minor: the “hatred” backstory is slightly abstract and risks flattening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories as flavor, pruning choices that reconfigure his stance—and the final renunciation (refusing to sell the fruit) is earned by prior beats. A hairline slip: “the knowledge fruit didn’t give answers. It gave context” edges toward label-speak mid-climax, blunting embodied contradiction by a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his hands “rough as bark,” the lacquer box “smooth from years of handling.” The curse of truth is embodied in the throat-burn moment before he speaks to the child. The final choice to plant the seed and accept disbelief carries felt cost. Minor slip: the father-to-son box history is summary, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. reverent restraint—play out in micro-choices (placing the shard, leaving it). The final renunciation carries felt cost: she forfeits ownership to gain listening. Minor slip: “inadvertently profound” is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—guardian of the child-god yet tender midwife to the intruder—are embodied in every telepathic pulse; the human’s micro-choice to press the seam costs them their certainty and their last breath of surface air, a renunciation earned by prior revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interior contradiction—grim optimism—drives every micro-choice; the chipped die biting her palm anchors motive in embodied pain. The final renunciation (turning back) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: forfeiting the door. Minor slip: “grim optimist” is stated once rather than dramatized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia and methodical hope are embodied in steady hands and micro-choices (dipping brush, pausing over glyph). Interior contradiction—exhaustion vs. hope—drives the final surrender to sleep. The gift-brush anchors motive and memory, but the calligrapher remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Cost is felt: the brush tip wears, the leaf vanishes, dawn must be rewritten.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Liora’s choices directly alter tactics: she shatters the lens, carves into bread, and triggers communal memory-rituals that reframe the city's future. Micro-choices under pressure (hands shaking while holding glass, repeated kneading) embody internal conflict and drive escalation. Earned Stasis in breaking the lens forecloses passive remembrance with visible cost: defying museum preservation rules and personal inertia.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—oil-stained fingers, the yoyo’s burn—while the contradictory pull between curiosity and self-erasure charges every beat. His final step onto the hunger stone is a credible renunciation foreshadowed by earlier glimpses of “time sticking like tar.” The interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Cost is felt in the erased reflection and the world’s backward clocks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s contradictory impulses—his need to reclaim identity versus his fear of what he’ll find—are embodied in the tactile handling of the raven clasp and the filmstrip heart. The final renunciation (letting the doppelgänger dissolve while pocketing its ember) is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost: his reflection now winks, sealing the new hunger. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, though the whispering advisor remains off-stage and thus exerts no relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leeward’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the mallet pulses “like a second heart,” grounding his restless drive. Contradictory impulses—fear vs thrill—co-exist in the same beats, and the final laugh carries earned cost: he surrenders control to the storm’s song. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (leaning into the sway, striking the orchard’s heart) reveal value hierarchy and foreclose retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elyas’s interiority is vivid—his fingertip reading of turtle-plate, the “gnawing certainty” that the watchers wait for him—but the final step into the watchers’ arms feels slightly under-motivated; we see no contradictory impulse that would make the surrender costly. His flaw (quiet obsession) is consistent, yet the price is more atmospheric than embodied. Still, the micro-choice to blow the whistle and then to step forward crystallizes his hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is precise—his pulse betraying his rational mask—and his micro-choice to photograph the page before Callahan arrives crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (leaving the crate) carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. Minor slip: “emotionally rational” is asserted rather than fully embodied in the moment of torchlight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—scientist’s detachment vs. poet’s grief—surface in the mortar fragment and inkwell beats, but the final renunciation (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) is announced rather than dramatized with visible cost, capping the arc just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is precise and embodied—his pulse stays steady, his fingers “trace” and “brush” with tactile purpose. The contradiction between his stated desire for stillness and his compulsive pursuit of hidden truth is dramatized in micro-choices (testing the stamp, leaving the chamber untouched). The final Earned Stasis—returning to the table, now burdened by foreknowledge—carries visible cost in the “ghost of a touch.” Minor slip: the ledger of future decisions is accepted too smoothly, blunting the shock.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern maker’s interiority is vivid—grief embodied in trembling fingers, the quartz “pulling” at her skin—but the final surrender feels slightly under-motivated; the leap from recording dreams to self-sacrifice is more lyrical than causal. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) are dramatized in the moment she presses the gem, and the cost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses float between vengeance and tender memory; the geode against skin, the upward veil, and the final tapestry reprise crystallize her choice. Flaws and interior contradiction ping till the end, bleeding cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lena’s contradictory impulses—her hunger to decode versus her refusal to claim the chip—are embodied in micro-choices (drone claw, stilling fingers). The final hand-taking renounces prior isolation with visible emotional cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: pilgrim’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied in the brass cuff, the watch hand, and the driftwood; his micro-choice to hurl the hand and accept tomorrow’s summons crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific—memory clings to objects, not minds—but the final beat leans slightly on abstract “weight of withheld truth” rather than a fresh contradiction, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority—his tactile fondling of the drawer pull, the micro-choice to lie that it is “a lever”—grounds motive in embodied action. The contradictory impulse to trade cache intel for a boy he doesn’t know is dramatized, not stated. Kaelis’s hesitation and the shared memory of carved initials crystallize a relationship shift under pressure. The final handshake and Elias’s pocketed lesson show earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—fleeing vs. facing—are embodied in the compass vs. poles tension; the final renunciation to “stay” is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (the hollow in his chest). Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“ghost with a paddle,” “swallowed apologies”) slightly dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liam’s contradictory impulses—yearning for absolution yet resisting empathy—are embodied in the micro-choice of hurling the baseball; the final chess move crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“hollow behind his ribs,” “hum in his bones”). Minor slip: the clinic’s promise is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the internal stakes at the inciting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vivid interiority and embodied emotion (bare feet feel hum of ancient soil), but the closure turn—“she was also the stag’s steadiness, the phoenix’s fire”—arrives as assertion rather than fully forged choice; the contradictory impulses are sketched rather than waged in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—ink as bruise, moss reluctant to release her boots—but the brother’s apparition is too lightly sketched to exert crucible pressure; the final unfastening lands as earned renunciation yet lacks a visible relational cost because the brother remains spectral.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lien’s interiority is vivid—her grief, hope, and bodily lightness are embodied in every beat. The contradiction between clinging to memory and striving to birth a future is dramatized, not stated. Micro-choices (needle, breath, push) reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost as she steps through the tear.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elira’s contradictory impulses—giving away light while hoarding ash—are embodied in the mirror shard and the final release of the bugs. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; the “texture of transformation” desire is dramatized through tactile choices. The earned renunciation (empty hands, full heart) carries visible cost. Minor slip: “philanthropist with empty pockets” is label-speak that could be dramatized more.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “tracing secrets like a poet” and the bronze quill holder as “cradle of sparks” reveal a man whose craft is identity. Motivation crystallizes around the ledgers: each “disappeared” villager hardens his heart “like steel in a forge,” making the final renunciation earned. The only gap is the off-stage villagers; their absence keeps relational pressure theoretical, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s interiority is vivid—her curse, her tactile grief, her bleeding fingers—but the final renunciation (“she was just the one cursed to keep it”) is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulses—preserve vs. release the poem—are dramatized in the storm-drenched moment. Micro-choices (tearing the poem, resetting the timer) align with motive and carry visible cost. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of possession. A hairline slip: the “cartographer” epiphany edges toward tidy summation, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's mechanical arm, razor tongue, and internal contradiction between yearning for answers and learning to wait land believably and drive each thrust of the duel-display-negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—restlessness to leave vs. duty to the library—are dramatized in the violet hand-off; renunciation of flight costs him the name he keeps molting. Interiority is embodied (“itch behind his ribs”) and specific. Maren’s status as ex-librarian applies immediate pressure; their shared silence hums with stakes. The micro-choice to stay (and lie about it) forecloses escape with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lena’s longing is embodied in her tactile ritual with the piano and clock; her strategic creativity shows in the spliced film and compass use. The final reunion is earned because every beat—winding the clock, threading the reel, following the projected path—flows from her refusal to surrender memory. Cost is visible: the projector bulb burns out, the arbor settles, the past is let go. Minor slip: “steely longing” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses—protect the island vs. preserve self—are dramatized in the seed-bite beat; the cost (loss of personal identity) is embodied in her violet-stained teeth and alien gaze. Interiority stays concrete, but the “reality checker” label is asserted more than shown in prior action, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his calloused hands, the way he “doesn’t want to crush a seed between his teeth.” The contradiction between his need to bend the bonsai and his fear of snapping it mirrors his unspoken guilt. The final micro-choice—planting the compass—earns the apology he could never voice, with visible cost (the compass is gone, the tree now bears the color of regret). One slip: the brother is off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; score capped at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (control vs observation) act in scene; closure choice (sabbatical) earned through accumulated dust patterns with visible cost ("illusion of control" relinquished). Colleagues off-page but stakes remain personal.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority excels in embodied glass-artist perception ("brittle patterns like forgotten script"), but brother's revelation lacks prior motivation groundwork; "steadily adaptive" trait surfaces too late to inform earlier choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interior contradiction ("grief" crimson vs "resolve" violet heat-map) drives agency; bleeding fingers embody cost without label-speak. Final choice to play the storm earned by tactile interaction with the case, foreclosing escape with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses (stubborn undertaker vs. believer in rest) act simultaneously under pressure; his ledger-microchoice and final self-addition earn closure with visceral cost (“edges biting through his coat,” “lens crumbled in his hands”). Interiority avoids labels through concrete sensory decay (“ink blurred,” “anemones flickered like panicked hearts”).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—craving anonymity yet becoming known—manifest concretely when he tucks Liora’s note into the bell’s handle instead of burning it. His "gently persistent" nature drives micro-choices (teaching Liora silent movement) with visible cost in the arbor’s destruction, though Manir’s silence lacks sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses (chasing fragments vs. needing wholeness) act simultaneously when pressing the jade; final keeper choice earned by years of pilgrimage with visible cost (jade vanishing). No diagnostic labels—emotions embodied via breath shapes and trembling fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority rooted in tactile contradiction: Liora both seeks connection (reaching for photos) and flees (running sideways), with bone-aching clench and disintegration dust showing earned change. No therapy-speak; flaws drive compounding choices toward "designing edges" renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's contradictory impulses (patience vs. recklessness) act simultaneously in the piano trap scene; her final scattering of seeds earns closure through six years of cell-bound causality. Minor abstraction in "chained liberator" label slightly dilutes early tension.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation for collecting absences is embodied in micro-choices (pressing ear to forge, placing copper imprint), but sister's silence lacks sufficient prior weight to fully earn the climax's emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Contradictory impulses (thief vs. destiny-seeker) manifest in micro-choices like exploiting the wilting peony, but the ledger's "carry the dark" cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Contradictory impulses act in scene: Elara's calloused hands (past abandonment) vs. "satchel heavy with tools she wouldn't need" (present renunciation). Final choice to flood the room earns endurance with visible cost—"abandoned this room again" made concrete by leaving the bookmark pointing toward the door.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "adaptation hadn't saved her" vs blood ritual, but girl's wisdom feels unearned; vulnerability epiphany skirts thematic echo in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction (obsession vs. erasure) drives closure; embodied emotion in "thumb smudging residue into skin" shows character-specific struggle without therapy-speak; final renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority masterfully concrete ("exhaled—a sound like steam escaping"), avoiding diagnostic labels while showing contradictory impulses (methodical unraveling vs. reverence). Flaw: janitorial flaw's causal pressure on choices remains implicit rather than actively complicating present decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lena's shift from mistrust to trust; embodied choices like drawing the ticket reveal values under pressure. Couple's underdevelopment slightly weakens relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in "mended deception" motivation and embodied emotion ("breath curling around a marble"); elders' off-page change slightly blurs micro-choices but single-POV constraints justify focus on gardener's irrevocable stance crystallization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "not just a sky mechanic" duality; embodied emotion via "mechanically warm" hands and oil-wiping micro-choice earns final belief shift. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant; blind spots in protocol violations compound organically.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("wanted to disrupt") and embodied emotion ("damp against his thigh") deepen Elias; ghost's influence shown through micro-choices like tracing warped paper. Slight underdevelopment in why disruption matters beyond curiosity limits 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: fever-scoured clarity versus trembling hands, smudging the illustration then placing it exposed. Final renunciation of voice—stepping into storm—earns cost via prior causality (barometer dip, ozone scent). No diagnostic labels; contradiction acts simultaneously in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines when Elias turns the valve "not as proof but as anchor," revealing simultaneous skepticism and desperate need. Micro-choices like pocketing bolts establish scavenger identity, but father’s backstory summary slightly dilutes embodied causality for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction ("grip on reality loose" vs. precise ritual) embodied through ink-dissolving thoughts and blurring edges; micro-choice of folding swan reveals hierarchy of witness over understanding with visible cost of self-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines through Elias’s "mellow" patience masking intense focus; Mira’s "fractured hum" embodies earned emotional contradiction without therapy-speak. Flaws complicate choices: Elias’s realization he "wasn’t to fix broken things" crystallizes with visible cost in Mira’s tears of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s dual role as preserver and participant in displacement; "He didn’t resist" crystallizes earned renunciation.

Avoids diagnostic labels despite high-stakes introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction ("didn't believe in fate" vs orchestrating through fortunes) drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion via trembling hands/ink rituals avoids therapy-speak; daughter interaction crystallizes status dynamics with visible cost in ticket transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Priest's motivation (illumination over exorcism) drives every micro-choice with embodied contradiction; "suspended breath" indigo embodies his tension between duty and curiosity. Entity lacks depth as character but functions effectively as thematic counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels with embodied emotion ("hands raw from threading needles") and micro-choices like tucking the shell, but the final shift to conductor lacks one concrete prior resistance to fortune-telling role, slightly weakening causality of closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction ("conquest not escape") and embodied emotion ("clenched the ancient clay tablet") culminate in earned endurance; micro-choices like tracing the hourglass rune directly foreclose prior paths with visceral cost as gravity settles.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s tactile yearning versus rejection of traditional music; drum maker’s archetypal wisdom slightly flattens relationship depth despite precise signing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s realization that flowers grieved *him*; embodied grief as "hollowed out ribs" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation—leaving the greenhouse—earns closure with visible cost (shattered lanterns, train ticket). No diagnostic labels mar peak beats.

    Interior contradiction shines in "ethically playful" nature versus the rope's profound resonance; embodied cost in "hands burned... frayed ends now smooth, now *alive*" earns the ladder's creation. Slight abstraction in "texture of time" motivation prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Liora's interiority shines through embodied choices (bow stilled at rustle, playing new melody) rather than labels. Contradictory impulses—preserving the past vs. creating new beauty—drive her micro-choices under pressure, culminating in the earned closure of playing "tomorrow's note" with visible cost in the hush's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.7)
    Liora’s contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. embodied empathy) drive her climactic choice to absorb the truth, with flaws (cowardice/tenderness) rendered through the chemist’s trembling fingers and the petal’s jagged static charge. No stock phrasing; "the raw, electric sting of wanting" crystallizes earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction crystallizes through embodied choices (dovetailing eyes, whispering "to ask not resurrect") and the final renunciation of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through Elias’s methodical caching versus reckless exposure; embodied emotion in "breath shallow" and "pulse loud" avoids labels. Final choice earned by seventeen years of silent witnessing, but the woman’s instant recognition lacks layered reaction depth.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s trembling hands (not cold) and shift from reactive archiving to active heartening; embodied epiphany when he understands silences are "full" avoids therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's embodied grief ("hands steady from years of mapping stars traced symbols") and contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. transcribing as rebellion) power the climax. Brother's manifestation risks convenience but is earned by her prior "sculpt space for echo" motivation and the tile's established physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction between immortal boredom and curiosity is clear, but micro-choices lack layered hesitation during the drop; "boredom was a slow poison" states rather than embodies the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority leans abstract ("edges sharp with weight") but micro-choices like pressing the bundle into steel crack earn credible endurance; emotional embodiment occasionally generalized (e.g., "fear warped time") though the ledger discovery's "shedding" action reveals hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s myth-buster duality ("debunked miracles while secretly praying for one") and embodied contradictions (pressing shell to cello amid dissolving journal) drive his earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (order vs chaos) drive every micro-choice; the foundation chip press into wet paint crystallizes earned commitment with visceral cost. Jax's underdevelopment prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (stealing sand, lingering shots), but "purposefully curious" label disrupts embodiment during high-stakes reflection; flaw slightly undercuts final renunciation's earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s blindness shapes embodied choices (water barrel diagnosis, tactile repair) rather than serving as label; micro-choice to fix via refraction—not direct access—reveals his methodology. Slight deduction for near-perfect flaw diagnosis lacking struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lena’s editor mindset drives choices (e.g., dissolving phrasebook page to rewrite currents), but her shift from skeptic to herald lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; the final acceptance feels earned yet underlayered in struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Limited interior contradiction; "infinitely patient" trait shown through deliberate steps but lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion strong in physical toll ("legs ached") yet final choice lacks earned moral ambiguity beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation to “change the beginning” is rooted in inherited lies, with embodied contradictions (hovering “just shy of falling, just shy of belief”) driving micro-choices. Final renunciation—keeping the name—forecloses passive acceptance with visceral cost (“burned like a secret”), though climax lacks deeper internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora's contradictory impulses (love as excavation/grief as mallet) manifest in embodied micro-choices like clawing through bead resonance. Keeper's pressure crystallizes stakes without reducing her to plot device. Slight abstraction in "hunger" lacks full physicality but closure's dissolution proves cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority anchored in concrete weaver’s craft ("sewed with memory") avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses ("haunting optimism" amid ruin) manifest when touching stone without fear. Lacks secondary character to test relationship crucible, but single-POV baseline excels.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interior contradiction ("didn't believe in miracles, but believed in roots") manifests in concrete micro-choices (planting seed in sundial wound); final action (following roots deeper) earns closure with visible cost—the cracked sundial symbolizing faith rebuilt through sacrifice, not magic.

    Lena's contradictory impulses (translator vs grafter) drive micro-choices under pressure; "shrewdly innocent" trait manifests concretely in decrying crayon smudges as "dialect of grief." Final endurance earns cost via "ribs singing" as she walks toward wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority concrete ("hands trembled," "breath curling"), motivation rooted in credible endurance of impermanence. Final choice (mixing new paints) earned but lacks visceral cost—conceptual acceptance of transience insufficiently embodied in pivotal moment.

    Liora's interior contradiction—preservation vs. creation—drives every choice; her "methodically playful" trait manifests concretely in brushwork and nickel interactions. Final renunciation of certainty (stepping through the door) carries visible cost: leaving the physical garden for perpetual awakening, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction weak beyond Elias’ charm; librarian/teen lack embodied conflict. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation—Elias’ defiance feels inevitable, not earned through struggle. "Spark of thought" closure avoids tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives micro-choices (palming ghost's sternum), but "shyly unstoppable" remains label-only without visible struggle against contradiction during key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction embodied through micro-choices: Lior's traced doorknocker versus burned bridges reveals his push-pull isolation. Final renunciation earned by prior causality ("silenced voices" → "let us go") with visceral cost in charcoal-dust lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in "refused to discard it" vs "unmade" climax; embodied emotion via trembling hands and compass hum. Near-therapy-speak in "befriended its absence" narrowly avoided by concrete action of releasing the gear.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in trauma responses (locked knee, sealed throat) shaping micro-choices, though interrogator vision slightly strains causality; final counting choice earns closure with visceral cost in "ledger of absences".

    Liora’s "diligently curious" trait drives micro-choices (sketching patterns, holding journal) with embodied contradiction (rule-breaker vs apprentice), but internal conflict lacks layered irrationality at climax—no fear competing with curiosity during the jump.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in misinterpreting "dawn" versus the child's correction, but sister's absence limits emotional depth despite the resonant final image of "time's absence."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction shines as Liora’s desire for respite clashes with her refusal to take ("didn’t ask what you’d get in return"), embodied through soil-touching micro-choices. Kael’s altruism avoids saintliness via flickering form and deferred release.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Liora’s interior contradiction—vendor yet seeker—drives her quiet agency; embodied in tactile details like thumb on obsidian needle.

No stock phrasing; flaws (hunger for revelation) compound organically.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (withdrawing vial vs. "not here to take") and sensory specificity ("bitter, metallic, stuck to roof of mouth"); final renunciation of burden earned through prior causality with visible cost in "clean" taste.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lysara’s scientific rigor clashing with grief-driven risk-taking; "hands trembled" embodies emotional conflict without labels. Brother’s vision and thumbprint smudge ground motivation in visceral, character-particular stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction crystallizes in Elias’s "symphonically minded" trait—his drive to give voice to grief clashes with knowing "no one remained to hear the music."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s fear of playing "when stakes are invisible" versus his need to translate silence; embodied via worry stone’s dent and magnetic tremors. Girl’s observation "You’re afraid" crystallizes his micro-choice to reach for the pawn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias' pacifism vs. necessary action, embodied by trembling hands tracing the sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Liora’s ambition manifests in precise actions (stealing seed, parsing scents) and embodied contradictions (rebellion vs craving serenity). Her micro-choices under pressure—planting despite Elders’ gathering—reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act in scene during the fracture dive; final choice to plant sapling earned by mentor’s legacy with visible cost—physical transformation via moss. No therapy-speak; emotions embodied ("veins thrumming").

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veyra’s contradictory impulses—scientific rigor versus intuitive dread—act simultaneously in scene (e.g., "tracing edges of a half-remembered dream" while rejecting guesses). Final renunciation of past self, marked by torn sleeve and "Listen," carries visible cost without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elias measuring silence yet seeking proof; embodied emotion via "knees hit damp earth" avoids labels. Final renunciation earned by prism's warmth preceding shatter, but motivation slightly fuzzy pre-vision.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)

    Interior contradiction shines in Liora's simultaneous fear/thrill and embodied choices (pocketing shard, stepping through seam). Final renunciation of static-seeking earned by prior causality with visceral cost—spaceport dissolving as conceptual forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s reticence manifests in concrete micro-choices (burning letters, pocketing glass) rather than labels; his contradiction—craving connection while resisting vulnerability—peaks when he stops returning the sea glass, embodying the earned endurance of isolation with visible cost in "throat tightened."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Liora’s interiority shines through embodied contradictions ("laughter wasn’t joy. It was a weapon") and micro-choices under pressure, like twisting the wick to resist the shadow. Motivation rooted in cyclical duty feels earned, though minimal backstory limits deeper flaw exploration without violating BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction underdeveloped during pivotal choice to leave; "recognition" lacks competing impulses. Embodied emotion strong ("breath hitched," "arms burned") but micro-choices lack value hierarchy at departure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Contradictory impulses shine in micro-choices: Elias deconstructs not to fix but to listen, hums while working, and passes sorrow along without sentimentality. Embodied sorrow as "weight" and "pressure" avoids therapy-speak, with final endurance earning cost through "hands... felt lighter."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lena's contradictory impulses—using perceived fearlessness as a tool while embodying grief—manifest in her micro-choices (dangling the fob as a "noose," deploying false starts).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
