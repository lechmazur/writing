    Elena's interiority is concrete and her perceptual bias (converting phenomena to data patterns) is consistent throughout. The core tension between stripping away drama and finding meaning in gradual change drives her micro-choices in the greenhouse. However, the final realization feels somewhat summarized rather than earned through embodied contradiction—she observes, reflects, and concludes without a moment where conflicting impulses force a visible cost. The butterfly dust gesture reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's initial survival and wound establish stakes, but his interior life is rendered through stock phrasing ("newfound clarity," "quiet resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The discovery of the father's furnace and inheritance feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Agency at closure—shaping the glass vessel—reads as solitary craft without visible cost or a path foreclosed; the walk toward horizon with "luminous shard" and "quiet promise" substitutes lyric assertion for embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation—to translate silence into music—is dramatized through concrete action with the tuning forks. However, her interior life remains largely abstract; phrases like "heat-mapping emotions" and "silently expressive" read as labeled traits rather than embodied contradiction. The change at closure (accepting silence as canvas rather than void) arrives through assertion rather than a visible on-page struggle with cost. The other survivors remain ciphers, applying no interpersonal pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The undertaker's interior is richly embodied ("hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow") and their stubborn refusal to abandon the dead drives the arc. However, the transformation into "not quite fish, not quite human" arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—building an eternal occupation rather than escape—lands with conceptual weight, but the undertaker's moment-to-moment decision process during lens assembly lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this to high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to build intergenerational support is clearly stated but rarely tested through on-page contradictory impulses. The boy and grandmother appear but function more as emblematic figures than sources of pressure on Mara's choices. Interiority defaults to label-only feelings ("quiet declaration," "gentle persistence") without embodied tension. The final vow to "keep ringing, to keep listening, to keep building" reads as assertion rather than a choice earned by prior dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira's interiority is abstract and label-heavy throughout ("spiritually curious," "hollow," "vault of unused love"), relying on emotional summary rather than embodied contradiction. Her actions—clutching the crystal, breathing, extending her hand—are gestural without revealing a hierarchy of values or genuine internal conflict. The "healing" arrives through passive reception of firefly-sparks rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The lover's dissolution and Mira's transformation read as declared rather than earned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes into obsession clearly enough, but her interior life is dominated by poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The great-grandfather reveal arrives through exposition rather than earned dramatization. Her final choice—to hold the fragment aloft—lacks visible micro-decisions under pressure; disintegration happens *to* her rather than through a decisive renunciation with felt cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; we get "hands stained with chlorophyll and light" but little visceral struggle in the months of work.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The liberator remains an abstract cipher throughout—"chained at the ankle," "his purpose burns bright"—with no embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or concrete micro-choices that test his convictions. His motivations are declared ("to plant resilience") but never internally conflicted or dramatized through struggle; he moves through the sequence with unchallenged competence. The sentry encounter ("with staggering grace, he swings the chain") reads as choreographed rather than earned through flaws or limits. Diagnostic label-speak ("his mind a calm ocean") and therapy-register interiority ("his heart a compass") flatten what could be a visceral ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation—to find the sound of trust breaking after Kael's betrayal—anchors interior logic consistently. The synesthetic trait (hearing colors) provides character-specific perception, though its application feels more ornamental than constraining in key beats. The final letting-go of the device carries some weight, but the protagonist remains largely observational rather than under pressure to choose between competing goods. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward abstract metaphor ("wound that wouldn't clot") rather than visceral contradiction in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lux remains a label-only construct throughout; "quietly savvy" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions trace a tourist's treasure hunt rather than genuine internal conflict—she decodes, finds, pours moonbeams, and boards a train without any foreclosed path or visible cost. The grandmother's journal and jar function as inherited props that require no struggle or renunciation. Interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("luminous disbelief," "destiny's door") recycled across beats without embodied emotion or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek's interior is concrete and specific, rooted in grief and the ritual of glassblowing. His motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" emerges through embodied action—touching dampness, speaking to dead machinery—and the final realization about making space for asking is earned through on-page micro-choices. Internal contradiction appears in his theatrical declarations to emptiness paired with genuine mourning. Minor deduction: the epiphany "to craft safe zones for inquiry didn't mean providing answers, but simply making space for the asking" edges toward articulated thesis rather than remaining wholly implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's transformation from stunt double to fleeing synthetic is signaled, but her phobias feel more decorative than genuinely constraining—she "turns fear into precision" via assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The motivation "to prove vulnerability is power" is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene; her actions read as competent problem-solving without visible internal cost. The final vow to "find others like her" arrives as epiphany rather than earned renunciation, and the "ghost of a daughter she never knew" introduces ungrounded sentiment that dilutes rather than deepens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The traveler and oracle remain generic vessels without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The traveler's motivation is declared ("seeking the pebble-shore oracle") but never tested on the page; he arrives, receives the map, and departs without a single micro-choice under pressure. The oracle's "mildly obsessed" trait is label-only, and her "task complete" satisfaction reads as summary rather than earned renunciation. No visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    J-3's motivation evolves from programmed maintenance to philosophical inquiry with some interior contradiction ("core directive-maintenance-clashed with a burgeoning question"), and the final choice to continue sweeping with altered awareness shows earned shift. However, the interiority leans toward abstraction ("a wellspring of spontaneous experience," "endless formation") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The robot's "remarkably composed" stability under surreal pressure reads more as label than lived tension that degrades perception or forces micro-choices with visible cost. Embodiment is present but the philosophical register distances emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to solve the embezzlement is clear and her action (gathering evidence, confronting the manager) drives the resolution. However, interiority remains largely surface-level—"heart beat," "quiet freedom," "renewed sense of purpose"—without embodied contradiction or struggle. The stagehand's tears-and-confession feels unearned; we never see Elara wrestle with doubt or cost during her investigation. The final paragraphs drift into abstract satisfaction ("trust had become the unspoken language") rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas's motivation to prove gardens know their gardeners remains asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. His interiority relies on stock metaphors ("dry rustle," "gnarled as the vines") and the climactic reveal feels like exposition rather than a wrenching choice with visible cost. The youngest heir exists solely to receive his explanation, flattening the relational crucible. Emotional progression is linear and didactic, with no genuine internal conflict driving the marble ritual beyond thematic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and her obliging nature earns access through concrete favors (fixing Chen's shuttle). Internal experience shows through mechanically warm hands and patient observation. However, interiority leans abstract at key moments—"subdued awakening, quiet as the mechanic's own heartbeat" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. The final choice (pulling the lever) feels inevitable from her conviction but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply releases it and keeps her secret.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's core motivation (seeking the ghost to find inspiration) is clear, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract constructions: "lately inspired pulse quicken," "meaning in decay." The decision to play the final note is dramatized, yet the pivot—understanding the diva wanted remembrance not freedom—arrives via narrated insight rather than embodied contradiction. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (cello neck cold against palm, bow hovering), but peak beats favor poetic summary over micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    The oracle's interior life is presented through lyric abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The motivation to "find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a micro-choice that forecloses options. The colleague's vanished note and the forgiveness epiphany arrive through summary rather than scene pressure, and the final release feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to measure his father's confession is clear, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("truth had mass," "silence grew heavier") rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to twist the valve and release the ghosts arrives without visible internal conflict—no competing impulse or cost that forecloses another path. The final choice to call the historical society feels more summary than dramatized struggle, reducing agency to a calm post-crisis plan.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Chronicle Keeper remains static across the entire piece—observation without on-page choice that forecloses a path or alters tactics. "Grips reality loosely" appears as a label but never constrains an action with visible cost. The swan journey and chamber discovery occur without internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; she simply continues her prior stance with reaffirmed intention.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation (nurturing wonder) is consistent and her approach "softly adaptive" shapes her method, but her interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted. Eleanor's moment of recognition—whispering Mira's mother's name—feels more like a plot convenience than an earned dramatic beat rooted in prior causality. The keepsake curl functions as a talisman but never creates an on-page choice with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; Mira moves through the scene without genuine struggle or a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through his eccentric belief that "walls could listen" and his methodical archaeological approach, but his interior life remains largely abstract. The discovery and cataloguing beats show professional competence without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final act—placing diaries in a sealed chamber—reads as completion of a research task rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost. His "sensitively perceptive" trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei Lin's shift from fearing her prophetic power to orchestrating futures through intentional fortune cookies shows clear agency and internal contradiction. The choice to "compose" rather than predict is earned through the discovery of the specs and her grasp of "directing flow." However, key emotional transitions—particularly the leap from fear to control—rely heavily on reflective summary rather than embodied struggle in the moment. The final self-directed fortune feels more like thematic closure than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a lived path.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miriam's interiority is specific (decorating with silence, using sound design as theology) and her micro-choices drive the exorcism; however, Elias remains functionally passive, a vessel rather than an agent. The entity's defeat reads as Miriam's achievement, not a conflict requiring both characters' choices. Internal contradiction is visible in Miriam's blending of faith and experimental method, but the final beat lacks visible emotional cost—she simply begins recording again without alteration or foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is labeled "chronologically homesick" and dreams of becoming "the conductor of unheard symphonies," but these remain abstract declarations rather than lived contradictions that complicate choice. Her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("exhaustion curling around her ankles like a fog") and therapeutic self-awareness without embodied struggle. The final gesture—storing the shell "a promise for tomorrow's dawn"—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as convenient affirmation rather than earned renunciation or alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The gravity defier remains an abstraction throughout—no embodied emotions, no contradictory impulses in scene, only declarative states ("Her motivation burned clear"). Interior is generic and label-driven ("periodic eternity," "fractured timelines") rather than specific to a mind under pressure. The final "surrender" is asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Agency collapses into passive dissolution with no visible cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's journey from numbness to feeling is present, but her interior life consists largely of poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic moment ("She felt the rustle of turning seasons within her, a thaw after eternal winter") reads as label-only emotional shift without micro-choices or dramatized struggle. The drum maker remains a vehicle for exposition rather than a character who applies pressure. Deafness functions thematically but does not constrain on-page tactics in concrete ways.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's curiosity and integrity drive his choices, but his interiority reads generic—"steeled his resolve," "the weight of his conscience"—rather than embodied and contradictory. The decision to send the pigeon follows smoothly from his values, but no competing impulse (fear, doubt, self-interest) acts simultaneously in scene; the choice feels inevitable rather than earned through internal friction. His ritual with the tube shows character texture, yet the absence of visible cost at closure (he simply walks on, smiling) undercuts the stakes. The final stance crystallization lacks the felt price that would elevate character work into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains an abstraction throughout—labeled as "ethically playful" and driven by "passionate subtlety," but these traits never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life consists of generalized philosophical musing ("He wondered if the energy beings had left this place as a test") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The climactic non-choice—"he decided to carry the rope onward"—forecloses nothing and costs nothing legible on the page. Motivation is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.2)
    The violinist remains a cipher throughout; her motivations are asserted ("She longs to unbind") rather than enacted through contradictory choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic statements ("Her heart feels the weight of the unfinished") that could apply to any character. The final "smile" and understanding feel unearned—no prior causality forces this shift, and no visible cost forecloses a path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dealer's motivation is stated repeatedly ("to fuse insight with empathy") but remains abstract—never tested by a concrete choice that costs something. The client undergoes transformation, but the dealer's arc is purely observational; the "faint affection" and "borrowed frequency" are asserted rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. Interior voice leans heavily on poetic labels ("counterfeit heartbeats," "synthetic sympathy") without grounding them in specific sensory contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece offers reflective interiority but lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would lift characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lena's interiority reads as generalized rather than character-particular, with motivations declared ("whimsically attentive," "shrewd," "motivation to uplift") instead of dramatized through contradictory impulses. The turn toward championing silent contributors arrives through exposition rather than an on-page choice with visible cost. Caleb's emotional beat—trembling hands, tears—relies on stock embodiment. The friendship develops off-page between paragraphs, flattening the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's desire to belong is dramatized through repeated attempts (reed-woven child, marsh-grass sculptures), but his internal contradictions remain abstract rather than embodied in scene. The girl's teaching sequences show progression, yet Kael's final "understanding" arrives as declared epiphany ("Kael understood then") rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The ending grants grafting without visible cost—villagers' marsh-grass offerings and the arbor's acceptance feel given rather than fought for. Emotional states are often labeled ("luminescent ache") instead of shown through contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her role as illustrator is integrated, but interiority remains largely descriptive rather than contradictory under pressure. The pendant choice at the climax is signaled but not truly conflicted—she "made her choice" without visible internal friction between competing goods. The transformation into echo feels more conceptual than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats operate at a declarative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vesper's motivation is clear and her final choice to leave the mosaic is earned, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("mathematics of emotion," "equations of grief") rather than embodied contradiction. The glass eyes function as props for ritual rather than revealing her internal conflict through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her "gentle, inventive" trait is asserted repeatedly but never costs her anything or forces a visible tradeoff. The lover's absence remains vague enough that the stakes of "bringing the absent back" never crystallize into a concrete dilemma with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied sensory perception ("sense memory was her language; touch was how she read the past"). Her motivation—becoming visible through methodical acts of kindness—is consistent and shapes her choices. However, the boy remains underdeveloped; we see only external behavior (hollow cheeks, finger-brushing spines) without interior contradiction or struggle. The final choice lacks visible cost: Mara will "cache another clue tomorrow" suggests repetition rather than foreclosing a path, and the boy's discovery doesn't alter his stance on the page in a way that reveals internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority shows embodied response to plants and storm, with micro-choices (pausing, stepping back, allowing vines freedom) that reveal her evolving stance. Internal contradiction between control and surrender operates on the page through action rather than summary. However, the metamorphosis remains largely described rather than enacted in high-stakes choices with visible cost; her decision to "let go" feels thematically asserted more than dramatically forced. The final image of standing in rain lacks a foreclosed path or visible trade-off that would sharpen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter's insomnia and exhaustion are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivation to "thresh meaning" remains abstract; the exchange with the scavenger lacks visible micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The final sleep and painting feel like symbolic resolution rather than earned change through on-page cost. Interior experience is told through lyric summary rather than shown through specific perceptual shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira receives label-only interiority ("felt the shift," "deeper awareness") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The pilgrim remains a cipher whose silent purpose is asserted rather than dramatized through goal-driven behavior. The closure choice—letting forces inhabit the pearl—lacks visible cost or foreclosed option; her clairvoyance simply "returns" without friction. Internal conflict is summarized ("blind spot," "veil drawn") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" is established, but her interior life remains thin—trait-label ("reactively visionary") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The navigator's weeping at recognition reads functional but lacks the layered irrationality or self-deception that elevates characterization. Agency exists (she demonstrates the valve's use, summons him, plays the sequence), yet the choices feel inevitable rather than wrestling with competing impulses. Interiority leans abstract ("sensing how absences could be navigated") rather than showing her mind's specific texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's cartographer identity is established through specific detail (ink-stained fingers, seven years documenting tunnels), and her interiority shows her analytical mind warring with instinct. However, the transformation from "meticulous route mapper" to someone who trusts ephemeral guides feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—her reason "wars with instinct" is told, not dramatized through competing micro-choices. The final pillar formed from her unspoken truth to her estranged brother arrives too late to create emotional cost; it's backstory exposition rather than a present forfeiture that closes a door.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's "sympathetic skeptic" trait is stated early but never constrains a choice under pressure—she proceeds with the tile work without dramatized internal conflict between skepticism and belief. The fisherman remains a silent prop; his grief is asserted but not embodied through contradictory impulse or micro-choice. Motivation is told ("as deep as the ocean") rather than shown through competing wants. The final softening of skepticism reads as summary rather than earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Althea's motivations are clear—escape from immortality's boredom—and her final choice to merge with the amulet carries visible cost. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("what happens after goodbye when the one who remains cannot die") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic dissolution feels asserted through elevated prose rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. No second character is present to test relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sam's interior life is specific and embodied—the "honest child of a con artist" tension drives contradictory impulses that crystallize in the final transaction with the director. The micro-choice to offer the ink pot rather than expose the con demonstrates earned character shift rooted in the prep-room discoveries. Minor slip: the father remains largely offstage, reducing relationship pressure that could have sharpened Sam's final stance. Emotional progression from rigid honesty to "ethical algebra" reads credible, though the phrase "ethical algebra" flirts with diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stationer remains an abstract figure throughout; we see studious recording behavior but no embodied emotion, internal contradiction, or micro-choices under pressure. The silence of the town below is declared but never tested against her motivations—she continues her ritual without friction, cost, or visible sacrifice. The final lines describe swelling pages and imagined futures, but no forfeiture or alteration of stance occurs. Label-only interiority ("earnestly studious," "quiet defiance," "incandescent restraint") replaces dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The survivor's motivation is concrete and embodied through tactile collection rituals (pressing palms, layering scraps), though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophical phrasing ("topology of erasures"). The final choice—placing the box and watching it refuse to float—carries visible cost (anchoring versus erasure) but arrives through accumulation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices throughout (recognizing handwriting, layering fragments) reveal hierarchy of values, yet the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final third. Emotional progression is credible but lacks the irrational layering or self-deception that would elevate complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a cipher throughout—his "myth buster" role is asserted but never dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. The piece treats him as a vehicle for metaphysical musings rather than a character with embodied stakes; we're told he's "cheerfully gloomy" but never shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The woman's voice is a memory device with no internal friction, and the final "understanding" arrives as summary epiphany rather than earned change with visible cost. Key interiority relies on label-speak ("ephemeral compass," "universal riddle") without grounding in particular fear or want.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's dual allegiance is clearly established and embodied through concrete gestures (tracing the stone chip, watching corporate logos). Internal conflict operates through simultaneous pulls rather than alternating summaries. However, the emotional arc feels smoothly calibrated rather than contradictory under peak pressure—no genuine mistakes compound before resolution. The final smile and determination read as resolution without visible cost foreclosing a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inspector's interiority remains thin throughout—her "purposefully curious" stance is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The piece tells us she carries "dawnlit melancholy" but never dramatizes competing desires or a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her decision to trigger the flare feels predetermined rather than earned by on-page struggle, and the final turn (standing, storing the image, turning away) lacks visible cost or a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Miren's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile/sensory method rather than labels. Her blindness drives both capability (water-feature navigation) and constraint (reliance on vibration/temperature), and the repair decision is earned by prior demonstration. Minor slip: Kael's presence feels more observational than crucible; his single question lands late without earlier friction to charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's internal life is present through concrete actions (tracing condensation, consulting the phrasebook) and the piece avoids therapy-speak. However, motivation remains largely declarative—he "tracked beginnings" and "charted beginnings" without embodied contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation ("He was the map now") reads as assertion rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a visible path. Agency at closure is poetic but lacks the felt cost of renunciation or endurance that would ground the change.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—restore balance through patient observation—but his characterization remains largely static across three centuries. The seven residents have distinct gaits memorized, yet they never appear as individuals making choices; they're drawn to the archway "without knowing why," which removes agency from the collective cast. The final moment shows Kael walking on with his "cryptic smile," but no internal contradiction or visible cost alters his stance. His infinite patience is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a moment where impatience would cost him or where waiting exacts a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dr. Lira Chen's choice to pour the vial and override survival instinct is motivated and embodied ("fingers flew, not to seal the breach, but to program"), but her arc leans heavily on told interiority and mystical compulsion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The helmet crack forces the final trade-off, yet the decision feels preordained by the ritual rather than earned through internal conflict. Embodiment is present but undermined by occasional therapy-speak ("instinct screamed," "betrayal of every survival protocol") that labels rather than shows pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The son character remains abstract throughout; no embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. His motivation "to thread a labyrinth with his own story" is asserted but never dramatized through a visible tradeoff or struggle—he simply speaks faster when time pressure is mentioned. The father's legend functions as backstory decoration rather than a live constraint that complicates present action. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; he walks away after an offstage monologue with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior is sparse; she performs tasks (tending, cradling, placing) but we never see contradictory impulses or embodied fear/awe. The ghost bride's motivation is stated ("repay a debt") but not dramatized through choice—she appears, instructs, dissolves without internal friction or visible cost to herself. The ending grants Elara "mournful elation" and "grief and triumph," labels that summarize rather than embody emotion under pressure. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values; the bead placement is compliant execution, not a decision shaped by competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is present but operates as a poetic cipher rather than a motivated agent. Her "hauntingly optimistic" stance is asserted repeatedly through abstract language ("ghost-light in the gloom") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The sleepwalking mechanism and tapestry-weaving actions occur in summary narration; no beat shows her wrestling with competing impulses or paying a visible cost for a decision. Villagers appear as a collective backdrop without applying immediate relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina's interior life is rendered through concrete sensory contact—brushing soil, fitting stone—and her motivation (restoring faith through rebuilding) drives micro-choices across the orchard. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression from dread-and-hope to quiet certainty reads linear and resolved without visible internal friction. The final renunciation or endurance that would foreclose a path with felt cost is implied rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("quiet tremor of faith returning") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is stated clearly ("to discover meaning in the margins") but remains abstract throughout; we see meticulous craft yet no genuine internal contradiction or micro-choice under pressure that might alter tactics. The client's desperation is mentioned but never dramatizes Kael's stake—no moment where exhaustion, doubt, or fear of failure threatens the work. Mira's brief appearance offers a functional exchange but no relationship crucible that tests values. The interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("pseudonym creator," "artisan of identity") and thematic assertion rather than embodied, character-particular thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("silence held its breath," "weight of unheard stories") rather than embodied perception. Her decision to act—folding the tapestry and stepping into the corridor—arrives but feels reactive rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "disguised wisdom as foolishness" attribute is asserted ("To the casual eye she seemed a foolish old woman") but never dramatized through an on-page choice or social friction. Emotional states remain poetic but lack the micro-choices under pressure that would ground her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's grief and quest for apology are clear, and the decision to read the letters aloud is earned. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("the wound I had carried") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The sister's death is revealed late (line 23), which weakens the motivational throughline in earlier beats. Mira remains a functional facilitator without applying her own pressure or demonstrating contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong embodied interiority anchored to physical objects (coral, cast) that constrain choices. The anesthetic haze justifies fluid time and reflection without flattening present pressure. Interior monologue stays particular ("archipelagos despite ourselves"), though "shared anxiety" reads slightly diagnostic. Final choice—holding coral to cast—earns the renunciation of reach with visible cost scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation to rediscover joy is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions flow in a single emotional direction—trembling hands, breath catching, heart swelling—without internal friction or competing fears that would complicate the choice to display the work. The final decision feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle, and the cost of her choices (time, risk, vulnerability) remains abstract. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart swelling," "breath caught") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation is articulated but never tested by a concrete choice with cost. Her "methodically playful" trait is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain any action or force a tradeoff. The visitor's question arrives without prior setup and Elena's final question to them feels like a prompt echo rather than a character-driven turn. Interior experience remains abstract ("felt herself awaken, a third layer") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's interiority is consistently grounded in botanical metaphors and his dual identity is dramatized through choices under pressure. The motivation to guard his "spark of defiance" generates visible micro-choices (kneeling to plant the seed, whispering the activation phrase). However, the auditors' arrival feels more like a plot convenience than an earned consequence of his actions, and Aris's charming-rogue persona is asserted more than embodied in contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallization (defiance flaring brighter) lacks visible cost beyond the momentary thrill.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    The poet remains an abstraction across centuries with no embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is declared ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. The insomniac trait is mentioned yet never constrains a choice or degrades perception. The merfolk shift from rage to peace via passive listening without on-page decision or friction, reducing agency to spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra operates as a pure vessel for thematic material rather than a character with embodied choices under pressure. Her interiority consists entirely of abstracted mood ("foxglove regret," "quiet defiance") without contradiction, micro-choice, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The "she realized" and "she understood" beats are told epiphanies disconnected from on-page struggle. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she continues her work in the final paragraph exactly as she did in the opening, rendering the arc static.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to unsnarl trust is clear and her "carefully reckless" gambit demonstrates contradiction under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on abstracted concepts ("symphonies of truth humming," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied perception. Kess's brief appearance delivers motive ("afraid you were right") but the reconciliation feels summarized rather than wrestled through competing impulses on the page. The final choice lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Alia's interiority relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to propose the hybrid plan is declared rather than shown through micro-decisions that reveal competing values. Embodied emotion appears in phrases like "heart quickened" and "quiet tremble," but therapy-speak intrudes ("slyly heartfelt," "encrypted compassion") at key beats. The council's adoption feels too smooth; no visible cost forecloses a path for Alia personally.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias remains a cipher whose interiority is told through abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The woman who left him is summarized rather than felt; his grief operates as poetic assertion ("echo of lost songs") without micro-choices that test competing impulses. The ledger rewriting and pigeon trust are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a present decision with visible cost. Emotional progression is smooth and declarative, lacking the irrational layering that would earn the final smile.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist exists as a collection of poetic labels rather than a person under pressure. "Featherly determined" is asserted but never constrains a choice; the internal experience remains abstract throughout ("my heart aches," "I intuit"). No embodied contradiction acts in scene—the narrator simply walks forward, counts steps, and crosses thresholds without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The final "legend" claim tells rather than earns transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iyana's motivation to prove her theories is clear and drives her into the facility, but her final choice to remain and "transform" lacks embodied struggle or on-page contradiction—she simply decides. The transition from scientist to dissolved entity is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstractions ("rhythm of belonging," "waveform you matched") that feel like thesis statements rather than character-particular perception. The AI Orpheus provides stakes but doesn't pressure her in a way that reveals internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is declared early and her final "understanding" is signaled, but the interior journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The moment she "felt a pang of sorrow" yet "curious joy" gestures toward complexity, but these emotions are told rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Her epiphany—"the paths were not erased by malice but reclaimed by the sea's own memory"—reads as delivered wisdom rather than earned through struggle. The "cheerful gloom" and "melancholy joy" labels recur without on-page cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra's motivation is clear and his analytical mindset consistent, but his competence borders on omniscience—every variable behaves as predicted with no genuine struggle or miscalculation. The interior remains cerebral throughout; we see calculation but rarely contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment ("randomness had been ordered") feels more like mission-accomplished summary than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Missing the blind spots and friction that would force a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra's motivation to "pen a cosmic verse" is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs. Her "choice" to remain anchored reads passive—the garden holds her, she surrenders—without embodied struggle or a hierarchy of competing wants. Interior states are labeled ("motivation burned clear," "obsidian grace") rather than shown through micro-decisions under pressure. The final transformation lacks visible cost; she simply becomes "a new creature" without forfeiting a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The glazier remains a vessel for reflection rather than a character making choices under pressure. His "motivation" to "illuminate value in the mundane" is declared but never tested by competing wants or costs. The pond scene offers observation—he tosses a stone and deciphers meaning—but no decision that forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses. Interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophizing ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") without embodied emotion or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's scars and firefighter expertise are established, but her interior life operates at a single pitch of poetic regret throughout. The core motivation—carrying guilt for thirteen years—remains static; micro-choices in the present (stone arrangement, releasing ash) feel ritualistic rather than testing contradictory impulses. The captain's death is recounted rather than dramatized, weakening emotional embodiment. Flaws exist but never complicate a live on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dr. Kael's motivation (solving hope mathematically) is signaled early and sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("quantum-entangled helium," "probability differentials") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "smile in her sleep" and the closing test-of-self moment gesture toward internal stakes, yet the piece never dramatizes a genuine struggle or trade-off—she succeeds smoothly without visible cost to her person or relationships. The "logical dreamer" label does minimal work; her actions read as methodical observation rather than choices under pressure that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira's core motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure—she "believes" and "understands" in summary rather than facing contradictory impulses that force a visible choice. The profession of corridor echo cartographer remains ornamental; no on-page moment shows how her sensitivity constrains a tactical decision or imposes a cost. Interior voice relies on abstract declarations ("sensitively perceptive nature translated chalk dust into feeling") and therapeutic self-awareness ("legacy's burden transformed from weight to compass") that flatten embodied struggle. The ending shift from discovery to activism is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized renunciation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mirage painter remains a cipher whose interiority is never opened; we observe grace and calm but never contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The borrowed heartbeat functions as a label-only prop rather than a felt constraint that complicates her choices. Motivation is declared ("to persuade the mirrors") but never dramatized through on-page friction between want and cost. The final dissolution reads inevitable from the premise rather than earned by prior causality with visible internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    The negotiator's interior is largely abstract and label-driven ("operatively gentle," "price of redemption") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The moment when he "felt the weight of redemption shift" is asserted, not dramatized through a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path. The generals remain two-dimensional pressure sources without distinct reactions or speech. Motivation is declared but not tested by on-page friction between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vesper's core trait—amoral philanthropist with secret sentimentality—is presented largely through labeled interiority ("beneath his ruthless exterior lay a secretly sentimental heart") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The drought's displacement of villages is told in summary ("the drought had displaced villages") without embodied guilt or micro-choices that test competing values. His final act of walking away reads passive; the cost is asserted ("his own making") but not dramatized through a visible forfeit or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to defy conformity is stated early, but her interiority remains abstract—"poetic body," "alarming grace"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The climactic unlocking happens through dance described in metaphorical terms ("arms weaving through cold air as if pulling invisible strings") rather than specific physical struggle with visible cost. Her transformation from courtesan to liberator is declared in summary ("her legacy as a liberator had just begun") rather than earned through on-page renunciation or foreclosed path. The final celebration feels convenient; no dramatized consequence tests her earlier choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Adrian's motivation is declared but not embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His "quiet obsession" with ethical storytelling remains abstract exposition rather than lived conflict; we're told he grew "sick of beautifying lies" but never see him struggle with that choice in scene. The audience members (trucker, dealer, woman) experience micro-epiphanies but their reactions are summarized rather than enacted through concrete choices with visible cost. Interior life defaults to elegant description ("traced phantom serifs") rather than messy, pressured thought.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Esme's motivations are clearly established—to honor overlooked histories through temporary monuments—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The "esoteric realist" tag feels more like exposition than a lived contradiction that drives choices. Micro-choices (knotting her hair, building the wind-harp) are present but lack visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The piece tells us about her calculations and understanding rather than showing her struggling under pressure with competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The caster's motivation is clear and her journey from self-forgiveness to purpose is tracked, but interiority leans heavily on abstract declaration rather than contradictory impulses in scene. "Technically gentle" appears as a repeated label without embodied cost; the moment where she weeps feels earned, but earlier beats summarize emotional states ("Her heart, once as frozen…") rather than dramatizing them. The final choice to continue harvesting ice is consistent but arrives without visible friction or trade-off that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is dense and specific—"foresight only through hindsight, seeing tomorrow's shapes in yesterday's shadows"—but motivation remains largely told rather than tested in scene. The seventeen-year bunker residence and her "precisely playful method" are asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to leave feels summarized ("she finally understood") rather than earned through on-page friction between staying and going. Embodied emotion is present in key moments (breath catching, mortar dust in hair) but the climactic turn lacks visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving knowledge across regime change—but his interior life remains thin, operating mostly as a vehicle for the conceptual premise. The "frugal astronomer" trait shapes a few tactical choices (working without incense, papyrus calculations) but never forces a meaningful tradeoff or complication. Emotional embodiment is sparse; his reactions to discovery and closure read as abstractions ("empirical mind," "stubborn patience") rather than lived sensations. The final act—activating the tile—lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would earn the renunciation or stance crystallization required at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's scheming pacifist identity is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. The interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("forgiveness wasn't a permanent state but a moment that had to be caught") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. Elara's "cellular memory" and "mosaic of every grudge" read as conceptual labels without micro-choices that reveal her internal struggle. The final dissolution feels unmotivated by prior character work—Elara's shift occurs through Mira's explanation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and specific—capturing a runaway dream—but the execution relies heavily on contemplative interiority rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The synchronized breathing sequence provides embodied process, yet the protagonist's agency reads more as receptive invitation than active struggle with competing desires. The transformation at closure feels delivered by the dream's cooperation rather than earned through visible internal cost or a choice that forecloses a path. Minor: "the taste of impossible sweetness" and similar phrases drift toward abstraction without grounding in specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mender's motivation is clear and her choice to return and work carries embodied emotion through the physical labor, the ribbon, and the encounter with her daughter. The interior landscape shows genuine contradiction—longing for connection while maintaining distance—and the daughter's arrival creates authentic pressure. However, the climactic exchange feels too articulate for the moment; the mender's reply ("Because sometimes the things we tie ourselves to must be let go, like leaves in autumn") reads as crafted wisdom rather than spontaneous speech under stress. The resolution moves quickly from anger to smile without sufficient friction, and the years-later summary dilutes the earned particularity of the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Evers's bewilderment is characterized through the nonlinear inheritance mechanic, showing him struggling to order fragmented memories. The progression from confusion to understanding is earned through the bathroom scene and shell-carving sequence. However, the interiority often operates at high register ("translator of cosmic secrets," "bewilderment was not a flaw but the correct state") that reads more thematic than embodied, and the final epiphany about being "a mourner" arrives through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice to bite the fruit and continue inquiring has visible consequence but lacks micro-hesitation that would ground the cost in lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's role as arcane linguist remains label-only; her expertise in "mapping the maze of shelves" never constrains a tactical choice. The warden encounter and botanist rescue proceed through told summary rather than embodied decisions under pressure. Interiority is generic ("felt the diary's brittle pages," "stood firm, her voice steady") without character-particular contradiction or embodied emotion. The "carefully resourceful" attribute appears only as assertion; no on-page tradeoff demonstrates what she forgoes to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira's motivation to find the garden is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("unkindled solace," "mosaic of two lives") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular thought. The final "choice" to stay reads as passive acceptance rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is summarized rather than enacted through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—translate confusion into clarity—and her adaptable nature drives the investigation forward through seventeen generations of records. The physical weaving task shows competence under pressure, though her interior contradictions remain muted; she dismisses impossibility "as merely undocumented, a challenge rather than a warning" but never faces genuine doubt or cost that would deepen characterization. The final choice to weave the phantom thread feels inevitable given her established traits, yet the emotional stakes remain abstract—her fingers tingle, she smiles, but we don't witness a visible personal sacrifice or renunciation that would elevate this to earned transformation. Backstory is minimal and anchored to present discovery, meeting BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation is clear and drives consistent action across the story—she seeks quiet in the storm and pursues it through concrete methods (humming, aligning the stone, studying cracks). However, interiority remains largely abstract: "felt the vibrations in her chest," "her heart a quiet drum" are generic embodiments that could describe any contemplative character. The final choice to place the stone and walk on lacks meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply continues her established pattern. Micro-choices are present but do not reveal a hierarchy of competing values under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The custodian's motivation ("prove that coincidences have meaning") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Her retrocognitive gift functions as a plot mechanism without showing cost or trade-off in the peak moment. The final choice to position the shard feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through struggle; no live option is foreclosed with visible internal friction. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("coincidence was merely pattern seen from too narrow a perspective") rather than embodied emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's preemptive nostalgia is established early but remains largely a label rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her descent and kneeling at the forecourt show embodied action, yet the final insight—"identity was not sculpted by choosing memories, but by learning to listen between them"—arrives as an epiphany without the protagonist facing a concrete choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("sum of every voice I have tried to save") rather than character-particular contradiction under pressure. The ending shift from grief to "acceptance" reads as emotional summary rather than a micro-choice that alters tactics or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cinder's motivation is stated ("defiant spark") but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The fire-lighting decision arrives without on-page friction or visible cost—she performs it smoothly, and the watchers' gasps are reported rather than dramatized through her perception. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("gravity of hopelessness," "buoyancy of wonder") rather than embodied sensation, and the final walk forward resets rather than forecloses a path. No meaningful choice or renunciation alters her stance; she simply continues her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority is heavily weighted toward lyric reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The brother remains a shadowed prop whose motivations and reactions are never dramatized; we see his "stubbornness and sorrow" but never his choices. The final acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through on-page friction. The jade cicada and pool observations serve more as atmospheric anchors than vehicles for micro-choices that alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's claustrophobia is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses that create scene-level friction. Her collecting behavior appears as a series of declarative actions rather than choices under competing pressures. The father remains a function rather than a presence who complicates her stance. Interior voice leans on abstract labels ("flavor of stillness," "stretched knot") rather than concrete sensory particulars that would ground her psychological state.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is dramatized through concrete action (adjusting resonance panels, monitoring the diplomat's shift), and the storm glass serves as an embodied tool rather than mere metaphor. The diplomat's arc from anxiety to tears is traced through physiological markers (drumming fingers → steady violet heartbeat → silent weeping), avoiding therapy-speak. However, the transformation feels overly smooth—he weeps and instantly comprehends silence without meaningful resistance or cost to his established priorities. The gift of the vial at the end bypasses the harder question of whether he can sustain this peace when returned to "boardrooms and bellowing trains."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lore keeper's interior world remains largely abstract—she is "wisely adventurous" by label, but her micro-choices (stripping paint, placing the ruby) feel mechanical rather than revealing contradictory impulses. The decision to *not* sit on the throne arrives suddenly without prior tension between competing desires; we see competence but no genuine struggle or embodied vulnerability under pressure. Emotional states are named ("serene," "purpose fulfilled") rather than dramatized through perception and physical reaction, flattening the moment when she relinquishes the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    The shadow keeper remains a cipher; her choices are narrated in abstract ("burned bridges carefully," "tended the shadows") without embodied micro-decisions under visible pressure. The visiting man appears only as a passive recipient of teaching; his agency is told rather than dramatized through resistant choices. Internal contradiction is absent—both characters flow through the text in agreeable gestures without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Therapy-speak and diagnostic language ("suffocating to breathe," "reconcile loss," "loaded emptiness") saturate interiority without grounded sensation or choice-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is present but often declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The pyramid scheme backstory frames motivation, but internal contradiction remains abstract—"shame converting into quiet resolve" reads as summary rather than simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice to collect diamonds and donate them lacks visible emotional friction or cost; we're told he "smiled" but not shown what path this forecloses. Micro-choices exist (turning the bolt, reprogramming the timer) but feel frictionless, as though the pressure to act never competes with doubt or competing need.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's role as "dynasty ender" remains abstract; interiority consists largely of stock receptive states ("his heart a drum," "breath caught") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother's whispered tales and the discovery of the true heir are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final shift from "ender" to "keeper" arrives as assertion without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aldric's interior remains abstract throughout—"withdrawn," "shivering bliss"—with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The vow he speaks at the climax is told rather than dramatized through hesitation or cost, and his final "step forward" reads as passive submission to the pull of infinity rather than an earned agency decision. The marionettes and orchard lack distinct knowledge states or flaws that would drive inevitable mistakes. Motivation is declared ("capture the shape of possibility") but never tested by conflicting impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marianne's broken-hearted grief over her son creates a specific, embodied motivation that shapes her archival work. Her choices are clear and character-particular: the decision to extend file lives, to trace the button's history, to send the letter without promising closure. The daughter's response provides an earned payoff that reweights Marianne's persistent grief into "tactfully hopeful" endurance. Minor: the social worker who placed the button remains speculative rather than dramatized, limiting the crucible of secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's resourcefulness is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory choices under pressure. Her swallowing the crystal reads as a clever plot move rather than an earned character decision rooted in prior on-page conflict. Internal contradictions are largely absent; she remains competent throughout without meaningful struggle against her own limits. The final choice to scatter drives lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—she simply executes her plan and escapes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The saxophonist remains a cipher throughout—his motives are declared ("hush a prophecy") but never embodied through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of stock poetic phrases ("eerie nostalgia," "vested hush") recycled without character-specific inflection. The ending offers no visible cost or renunciation; he simply walks away, mission complete, with no dramatized stakes forfeited. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses are absent; the character functions as a vehicle for atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira is given tasks and emotions but never faces a genuine internal contradiction or a choice that reveals competing values. Her actions—sorting, building monuments, climbing—proceed without friction or cost that would test her commitment. The "mossy delight" label appears repeatedly without embodied texture, and her heart "quickens" on cue but no decision forecloses a path or imposes visible sacrifice. The ending grants fulfillment without struggle, erasing any opportunity for earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to repair the pattern-clocks is clear, and her descent shows embodied action. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("broken-clock tinkerer who could mend any timepiece except the one measuring her own life") without grounding contradictory impulses in scene pressure. The final shift to "learning to navigate by the moment" reads as declared insight rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a prior path. The grandfather's influence remains abstract backstory rather than a present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is richly textured through her alchemist's lens—"balance, not belief"—and the piece embodies her regret through the coin's handling. However, the motivational arc from signing the warrant to the coin ritual feels oblique; the character arrives at "redemption was not a finding but a recognizing" without a visible micro-choice under pressure that dramatizes the shift. The final walk-away reads as acceptance, but the cost (what path is foreclosed?) remains abstract rather than felt in a forfeited option or altered relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied—"modestly fearless, not immune to terror but practiced in moving through it as rain"—and the protagonist's pursuit is driven by a specific failure (leaving the child's laughter behind). The final realization that "healing wasn't about restoring what was lost, but integrating the broken pieces" is earned through the physical pursuit and the harp's distorted notes. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional duty and personal avoidance of pain, though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulated wisdom rather than pure dramatization. Motives are consistent and the cost—accepting fragmentation as part of wholeness—is visible in the moment Kael laughs "as misaligned and honest as the harp."

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is mentioned repeatedly but never meaningfully constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her trauma responses are described rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The interrogation backstory floods the present frame without altering present tactics—she walks, braces, recites numbers, but none of these actions foreclose options or reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "understanding" that mercy must be lived arrives as assertion rather than through a choice that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior processing relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("weight of untold histories," "eternal instant") that doesn't land as embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to become "the keeper of their light" reads as epiphany rather than a decision forged from prior struggle with visible cost. Micro-choices throughout feel more observational than pressured, with the fragment guiding rather than the translator wrestling with competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlon's motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is signaled early and drives his actions, though the "quiet obsession" feels abstract. Interior moments are concrete—his trade reading of dust patterns has specificity—but the climactic choice (taking one mainspring, leaving the rest) lacks visible cost or contradiction; he simply acts as witness without foreclosing a competing want. The ghosts remain atmospheric rather than forcing a dilemma, and the final "weightless burden" reads as summary rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to transcribe frost patterns is established early, but her interior life remains largely atmospheric rather than contradictory. The bottled whisper choice occurs without visible internal conflict—she uncorks it because the pattern "insisted," not through a dramatized tension between competing desires. The final smile reads as asserted resolution rather than earned transformation through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is conveyed through poetic description rather than physical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses; his poet's heart and revolutionary past are told labels without embodied pressure. The final choice to preserve the poem feels symbolic rather than costly—no on-page foreclosure of alternatives, no visible trade-off. Voss enters late and his silent nod is acceptance without struggle, undercutting relational crucible potential. Interiority leans heavily on abstract nouns ("burnished sorrow," "quiet grace") instead of specific perceptual particulars under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The repairman's interiority leans heavily on label-only emotion ("doubt," "inadequacy") rather than embodied contradiction. His curse mechanics (rust spreading near dishonesty) constrain surface actions but the protagonist mostly narrates rather than choosing under competing impulses. The climactic moment—speaking "true names" to components—reads as a ritual declaration without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Backstory about the "careless lie" is told rather than dramatized in a micro-choice that tilts the present.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is coherent and her decision-making follows from her established traits (collector, sensibly eccentric, university-associated). The psychometry reading and her final choice to become keeper rather than follow demonstrate internal consistency. However, the protagonist remains observational through most beats; her peak choice—placing the compass and walking away—feels more like ritual completion than a decision forged under contradictory pressures. The embodied emotion is thin: we're told she feels "the weight of a thirty-man expedition" but her bodily experience stays abstract throughout the descent and lagoon encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is consistent—sculptor seeking lineage connection—and her interiority is specific ("hands perpetually learning the language of salt and grain"). The climactic decision to place the carved token feels earned by the discovery of ancestral signatures. However, the character arc relies heavily on passive reception of magic-slide revelations rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the internal conflict is more conceptual than embodied under pressure. The final stance crystallization is present but lacks visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sable's journey is motivated by the thematic question about night-blooming flowers, but her interior remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The cathedral revelation that she sees herself in the glass feels unmotivated; no prior causality explains why *she* would be depicted there. The final "reckoning" is told rather than shown through embodied choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("quiet wonder," "umbral tenderness") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but her choices feel summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The retro-cognitive trap operates as a vivid label, yet interior contradiction remains abstract—"sand in her sheets" is an evocative image but her moment-to-moment struggle reads as exposition. The Under-Minister's shift from adversary to ally happens off-camera ("He flinched, recognizing...") without on-page friction that would show contradictory impulses. Maria's memory fragments are told, not inhabited, flattening what could be a layered internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael remains a vessel for concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His "refusal to accept false comfort" is declared but never tested against an opposing desire on the page—no moment where restoring the literal past tempts him against his stated philosophy. The final choice to "release collective memory" feels inevitable from paragraph one rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical positions ("the greatest alchemy was not transmutation but imagination") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation to archive emotional patterns is established, and his accidental prophecy creates internal conflict. The character's embodied emotions (trembling hands, phantom itch, weight of prophecy "like a velvet shroud") are concrete. However, key choices feel contemplative rather than decisively enacted—he performs ritual actions but the stakes of sealing the vault versus alternative responses never face genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a passive vessel for abstractions ("vortex inheritance," "borrowed time") without embodied contradiction or interiority rooted in concrete stakes. The piece tells us she "felt the tug" and "understood the texture" but never dramatizes a conflicting want or micro-choice under pressure. Actions (scattering seeds, stepping into the vortex) are performed without visible hesitation, cost, or trade-off that would reveal character hierarchy. The label "furiously tranquil" is asserted repeatedly but never constrains or enables a specific on-page decision with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is present and her choice to withhold the alarm is rooted in her established trait of "credibly curious" precision, but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene—she moves from doubt to certainty in a linear path without genuine ambiguity at the decision point. The motivation for trusting the instruments over protocol is clear, yet the cost of her decision (villagers might have fled for "false fear") is told rather than embodied through a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin; phrases like "curiosity, that other compass" and "her credibly curious nature" label rather than dramatize the felt pressure of the zero-hour dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sola's spiritual curiosity and empathy are asserted repeatedly but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The vow to "tend this quiet garden" and "find strength in vulnerability" arrives as summary rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on therapeutic abstractions ("heart, once armored," "vulnerability became her strength") that flatten character-particular texture. The final legend feels imposed rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is stated repeatedly but never embodied in concrete action or internal contradiction. The "astonished recluse" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows astonishment constraining a choice. Her final vow to restore the hives arrives without prior struggle or visible cost—she simply "resolves" with no foreclosed path. Interiority cycles through stock phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is largely mediated through abstract metaphysical musings rather than embodied emotion. The borrowed-time premise exists as label rather than lived contradiction; we never see her wrestle between contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to "stop embedding messages" and "learn to read the texture of time" arrives without on-page cost or visible foreclosure of a prior option. The figure coalescing from dust introduces a second character late without clear relationship pressure or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains purely observational across 32 paragraphs with no meaningful choice under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract epiphanies ("beauty often resides in what is left unfinished") delivered as therapy-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final "whispered a new verse" is told-only; no on-page action forecloses a path or reveals competing desires with cost. "Warmly attentive" functions as a static label never tested by an opposing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his systematic approach to the orchard work embodies his character, but his interior life remains somewhat flat—the diagnosis produces only "weathered calm" and "brazen calm," labels that recur without embodied contradiction. The final transformation into the orchard reads more as allegorical convenience than earned character arc; we see no struggle between fear and acceptance, only serene execution. The diary's marginalia about metabolizing his passing arrives late and functions as a plot unlock rather than a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Secondary characters (the new caretaker, the oncologist) are present but apply no immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist remains thinly drawn; her "luminous skeptic" label is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The exile and academic rebellion are told backstory without on-page stakes testing those traits. Interiority consists mostly of abstractions ("quiet promise of discovery," "bronze resolve") rather than specific perceptions under pressure. The final choice to publish lacks visible cost—no relationship, resource, or safety trade-off dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coachman remains largely abstract—a collection of poetic attributes (speaks dead languages, understands birds) without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to reclaim the battlefield is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final weeks-long summary tells us he tends the garden but we never see a moment where exhaustion, doubt, or failure tests his commitment with visible cost. No secondary character appears to create relational friction or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Wick's motivation is concrete and embodied through scent-tracking instincts repurposed toward connection rather than bodies. His interior contradiction—sharp nose, heart elsewhere—drives the journey and Maya's archive revelation earns its emotional weight through prior deployment details. The final curl among cylinders shows genuine transformation with visible cost (leaving the settlement, accepting she's gone). Minor slip: the "translate distance into closeness" epiphany arrives slightly over-articulated for a bloodhound's interior voice at that exact moment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is physically embodied through details like the compass rose on the cuff and the act of sketching, but motivation relies heavily on poetic declaration rather than contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The decision to step through the hatch feels inevitable from the opening rather than a choice earned through visible internal conflict. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("true north was not a place but a decision") rather than character-particular perception that degrades under stress. The final act lacks visible cost that forecloses a legible path; drifting into the void reads more as lyric gesture than a choice with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kaelen's interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("sacredly playful curiosity," "apprentice of wonder") without embodied contradiction or specificity. His choices at the chessboard and with the heart feel procedural rather than pressured by competing impulses. The master's absence is declared but never dramatized as a live tension that shapes micro-choices. Emotional progression is smooth and declarative, lacking the credible irrationality or hypocrisy that would ground the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's interiority is presented through poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The crisis-actor backstory is told, not embodied in micro-choices under present pressure. The prisoner emerges as a plot function without genuine friction; handing over carved pawns feels symbolic rather than a costly renunciation that forecloses a path. Emotional states are labeled through metaphor ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") instead of embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to understand "the shape of home" is declared but her internal contradiction remains abstract—why this search matters *now* beyond thematic assertion is unclear. The feather's origin ("a bird she had once saved") gestures at backstory without grounding present choice. The final moment where she "smiled, the weight of memory now a gentle echo" tells resolution rather than embodying it through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is minimal; the prose labels states ("motivation thrummed beneath her ribs") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's guilt is clearly established and his arc from exile to redemption is legible, but interiority remains abstract—"fierce repose," "quiet storm"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance of the girl's pawn earns some change, but the decision feels inevitable rather than torn. Diagnostic label-speak ("forgiveness was not a single act but a continuous winnowing of guilt") in the final third lowers the score. The character reads as a vehicle for theme rather than a mind under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is articulated but his interiority remains flat—his "innocently mischievous" stance is told rather than embodied in micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. The label-speak phrase "defiant heart softening" near the end abstracts emotional change rather than grounding it in action or perception. Mara enters as a reflection device but never exerts independent pressure; her questions echo Kael's thesis without friction. The Elders' reversal lacks dramatized internal cost—they "saw the ritual not as duty but as choice" summarizes a change that warranted scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to "conjure meaning from absence" is consistent and drives her actions through the procedure. Her embodied state—counting heartbeats, trembling hands, hypoxia—grounds the interiority. However, the internal experience relies heavily on poetic assertion ("uncertainty was her discipline") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation into "something entirely new" feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices that visibly foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's motivation is established early, but his interiority remains generic and label-driven ("intimately aloof" appears twice as unearned descriptor). The painted seashell functions more as symbolic prop than embodied choice-driver; his decision to paint it in the oasis feels pre-determined rather than wrung from competing impulses. The "promise kept" resolution arrives without visible cost—no renunciation, no foreclosed path—only declarative relief ("felt the weight of the past lift"). Embodied contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are absent; the character executes a plan rather than wrestling with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between held-back tenderness and quiet observation creates authentic tension, and her embodied interaction with the cork grounds her emotional state. Marcus's transformation at the end—from shouting to trembling silence—feels earned by the vibration metaphor that runs through the piece. However, the climactic moment leans on metaphysical mechanics (vibrations purifying intent through cobalt glass) rather than interpersonal risk, which distances the reader from genuine relational stakes. The final exchange ("teach me how to listen" / "we begin with silence") edges toward therapy-speak at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's grief-driven motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his goal to recover his sister's voice. The emotional arc—building the resonator, hearing her voice, achieving "fragile peace"—shows progression. However, the final beat relies heavily on label ("raw solace," "tears carved rivers") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Internal conflict is present but smoothed into a tidy resolution without visible renunciation or foreclosed path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "cultivate psychological safety" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The involuntary truthfulness remains abstract—we're told the curse forces raw honesty but never see the protagonist struggle with a specific secret they desperately want to hide. The final "teaching" mode (instructing villagers to pause before the eye) flattens agency into facilitator role rather than showing a choice that forecloses a personal path with visible cost. Interior voice leans toward thesis-speak ("fragile space where truth could be spoken without becoming a contagion") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.8)
    Cornelius's gift is established early and his investigation follows clear choices, but his interior life remains abstract—he "felt the pressure" and "sensed a quiet desperation" without embodied contradiction or visceral stakes that test him personally. The borrowed memory mechanic is more premise than pressure cooker; no genuine blind spot or flaw complicates his reading, and the stranger's question "Who will remember me?" is answered too cleanly without visible cost to Cornelius's own stance. The final smile and placement of the sketch feel like closure by satisfied understanding rather than renunciation or transformation with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Merrick's interiority shows contradiction—solitude versus Clara's fire, empirical mind versus faith—but key choices feel predetermined by the setup rather than forged under pressure. The matrix chip's warmth functions as an external cue more than an internally contested decision point. The final step through the doorway reads as acceptance of a riddle's answer rather than a choice that forecloses a visible alternative with cost. Embodied emotion appears ("trembling fingers," "quickening breath") but the peak moment lacks a dramatized internal rupture that would elevate the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The queen's disenchantment is asserted but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her transformation into sentinel is told through summary ("Understanding flooded her") rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The vision sequence provides backstory exposition that flattens present tension rather than tilting a live decision. Interior voice relies on elevated abstractions ("the weight of a thousand years of watching") that read generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist remains a cipher whose motivation ("to capture the density of presence") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("she felt the weight of that promise settle into her bones") rather than character-particular perception. Kael exists only as a philosophical sounding board with no distinct interiority or pressure of his own. The final "choice" to return differently carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—no prior desire is renounced, no competing value system abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicler's interiority is vivid and specific ("jealousy of past selves who still believed time was a line"), with embodied confusion driving the writing act. However, the protagonist remains largely reactive—observing, feeling, writing—without making a high-stakes choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final descent "not as a man but as a narrative" reads more as metaphorical assertion than earned agency. Internal contradictions (jealousy versus acceptance) are present but lack the push-pull tension of simultaneous impulses forcing a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's loss and adaptation are embodied through concrete sensory substitution (watching oil viscosity, listening to water's heartbeat), and her shift from control to translation shows internal contradiction. However, key moments lean on therapeutic metaphor ("valve turning in her chest") rather than dramatized bodily experience, and Marcus's insights arrive fully formed without the friction of his own limits. The final choice to carry the screw feels more symbolic acceptance than a decision with visible cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelin's motivation to transform scars into stories is clearly stated but her interiority relies heavily on label-only feelings ("anxiety rose," "weight of her past lifting") rather than embodied contradiction. The crystallization of ink under stress functions more as external metaphor than genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation feels asserted through poetic summary ("each crystal a released memory") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Backstory about her mother's passing anchors present ritual but doesn't alter present options enough to justify its length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical handling of the perfume device, but her interior contradiction remains largely told rather than enacted in micro-choices under pressure. Linden's response—shoulders softening, a sigh, fingers striking a key—provides embodied reaction, yet his decision to extend his hand feels more like a graceful endpoint than a choice that forecloses a genuine alternate path with visible cost. The metaphor-heavy dialogue ("A broken chord still vibrates") reads as writerly rather than the idiom of a gossip columnist under stress, creating a register mismatch that dilutes character particularity at the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The witness exists primarily as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than as a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is declared ("motivation to unravel cosmic illusions burned brighter") but never tested through competing desires or costs that force a difficult choice. The final merger with the dictionary reads as metaphysical event rather than earned character transformation, with no visible psychological price for becoming "what she observed." Interiority consists largely of cosmic abstractions rather than embodied, particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is labeled "eminently peculiar" and shown speaking to gears, but interiority remains abstract philosophical musing without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The quest "to understand what clocks really measure" is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; he muses, counts, and withdraws the key with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Emotional states are asserted ("felt the weight," "realized") without embodied sensation or credible struggle. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany without prior causality earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lila's motivations are clear but remain largely declarative rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The father is present only in memory; no on-page relationship pressure exists. The final promise "to teach the beauty of probability without the pain of loss" reads as self-aware epiphany rather than embodied choice under stress. Internal conflict is summarized across the narrative rather than dramatized in simultaneous action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior motivation ("to teach endings how to begin") arrives as thematic assertion rather than earned contradiction; her shift from "practiced detachment" to "heart, now open" telescopes across repetitive loop encounters without embodied cost in micro-choices. The voice crackles through with distinct turns ("frozen, thawed a little"), but emotional progression flattens into therapy-speak ("heart unburdened," "estrangement, once a fortress, now felt like a bridge"). No genuine internal conflict dramatized—desire to connect versus cultivated isolation never collide in a single charged beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clear—preserving memories and regenerating a lost covenant—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("haunted euphoria," "quiet resolve") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to leave the bouquet and write in her journal feels more symbolic than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. The piece shows "gently thorough" through action but lacks genuine internal conflict; the archivist moves smoothly toward renewal without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. No second character appears on the page to test relationship dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira remains entirely externalized—no embodied emotion, no interior contradiction, only summary labels ("desperately jocular," "elusive"). The station's residents are abstract "denizens" and "souls" who never individuate; Gus and Elara are named but perform only plot functions. The piece tells us Mira "cataloged each narrative" and "her mission complete" without showing a single micro-choice under pressure or a contradictory impulse that would dramatize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to find the stillpoint is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("quiet blaze," "unspoken grief") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The decision to kneel and absorb the note arrives without visible resistance or cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion appears ("her skin absorbed the song's language") but quickly dissolves into label-only feelings ("sorrow," "hope," "grief") without specific sensory anchors. No internal conflict complicates the journey; she moves smoothly from one musical note to the next without mistakes or blind spots that would make her struggle credible.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's interior life is articulated through consistent metaphor ("confidently uncertain stance," signal interpreter listening to cosmic noise), but his choices lack genuine contradiction under pressure. The pen-editing sequence shows him correcting errors without visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "content in the knowledge" and smile read as tidy resolution rather than earned endurance with foreclosed paths. Motivations remain abstract ("thresh meaning from experience") rather than embodied in specific, contradictory wants that force painful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interior state is established through the vintage camera ritual and his physical gestures, but his transformation feels more asserted than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The advisor remains largely external—her charisma is declared ("gravity that bent the air") rather than dramatized through specific actions that test Elias. The final shift from "waiting for someone to remember him" to "permission to remember himself" arrives through her instruction rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The embodied moments (lifting the camera, clumsy signing) are present but the protagonist's agency in the climactic realization lacks visible internal cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's shift from arsonist to restorer is established, though the interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("volcanic tenderness erupted," "analytically intuitive mind") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to rescue Cress's promise drives the extended painting sequence, but the weeks-long work is compressed into montage that tells rather than dramatizes micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (staying as librarian) is credible but arrives without a visible on-page cost that forecloses an alternate path; we don't see what Kael gives up by remaining.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation to merge consciousness with Mira is clear and drives the final act, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract grief rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "fragments without connective tissue" frame positions him as reactive rather than internally conflicted until the climax. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (bleeding hands, drumming on ribcage) but much of the interiority is summary ("he got fragments," "beautiful, transient, aching with loss"). The final choice—dissolution into the garden—feels earned by prior setup but lacks visible internal resistance or cost beyond the physical act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marek's expertise in acoustic architecture and his ability to identify walks is specific and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. However, the protagonist remains competent throughout without meaningful internal contradiction or struggle—his plan works perfectly, leaving no visible cost or foreclosed path. The smuggler's crew is caught, but Marek's stance and capabilities are unchanged. Micro-choices exist but don't reveal a hierarchy of values with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    The guardian reads as a static archetype rather than a motivated individual; he performs symbolic gestures but no internal contradiction or micro-choice reveals what he personally risks or wants beyond the stated mission. The child's fear is told through "silent empathy" rather than dramatized through behavior, and the smile at line 31 arrives without earned progression. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("spiralingly calm presence," "weave light") that functions as atmospheric label rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to pass the mirror feels inevitable from setup rather than forged through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mr. Hartwin's motivation to plant "forests of second thoughts" is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. His ability to hear "unspoken words" operates as a convenient supernatural device without cost or constraint—he simply knows what others feel without any visible price or misfire. The students remain generic placeholders (widened eyes, carrying lanterns) without distinct voices or choices that test Hartwin's methods. The final whisper to a child feels like thematic summary rather than an earned character moment forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear—dock worker yearning for dance—but her interiority often substitutes lyric assertion ("her body a silhouette," "fortress of duty") for embodied contradiction under pressure. The guardian encounter offers a single micro-choice ("twisting away while offering her open palm") that reads as graceful choreography rather than a decision with visible cost or competing impulses. The final transformation into "dancer of the tide" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no blind spot or mistake compounds before resolution. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is narrated through metaphor rather than perception and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    The performer's morally ambiguous role (informing on neighbors) is present but yields no on-page dramatized cost—the dog-reporting is announced, not enacted with visible friction. Interior life consists largely of abstract declarations ("grief pooled like dark water," "emotional void") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The whittling and dramatic narration are repeated gestures, but they do not escalate or force a meaningful trade-off; the final wooden figurine placed on the windowsill feels like a symbolic coda rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.2)
    The cloud-shadow poet remains a label rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Interior states are declared through abstract sensory metaphors ("boundary between hearing and feeling," "tremor of certainty") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final "stride" and whispered verse feel like thematic gestures rather than decisions that foreclose a path with visible cost. No genuine internal conflict or flawed choice-making appears; the protagonist observes and aestheticizes without meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's colorblindness is established but never constrains a choice; her "innocently cunning" reputation is told, not shown through on-page action. Dorian's interiority is absent—he remains a reactive cipher. The barter happens without negotiation or embodied hesitation, and the transformation at the end is asserted ("felt a stirring") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's motivation to understand sound's texture is clear and drives her experiment, but her interior remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The interaction with Mara introduces genuine friction—"You're wasting time... 99.7% accuracy"—yet Kaelen's response feels abstractly confident rather than conflicted. The final beat where Mara touches the lens and whispers "It feels warm... Like it breathes" hints at change, but the cost of this discovery for either character is largely implied rather than forecloses a visible path. Interiority trends toward thematic exposition ("the proof that being heard meant being changed") instead of concrete contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to teach a withering star...how to bloom again") arrives via abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction or pressure-driven choice. The core emotional arc—grief as "white dwarf"—is told through metaphor rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal states are labeled ("numb," "ashamed," "subdued ardor") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The woman's arrival and Elara's recognition that "the stencil had been her future self" land as exposition rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's professional identity is clear and her "steadily curious" stance is stated repeatedly, but her internal contradiction remains mostly asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses in action. The architect's transformation from trembling desperation to "hunger of a convert" happens too quickly without embodied struggle. Micro-choices are present (dealing cards, extending the tape) but they don't reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost—Mara operates with professional confidence throughout, never forced to choose between conflicting desires. The ending gesture ("Show me how to build again") lacks the friction needed to make the choice or renunciation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyra remains a cipher throughout; her interior is filled with label-only emotion ("anguished joy") and therapy-speak ("end of innocence") rather than embodied contradiction. The "personal loss" that motivates her is mentioned twice but never dramatized, leaving her quest abstract. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values—she touches the pagoda, memories flood, she withdraws—without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path. The backstory references to empire and lost innocence exceed 20% of the text without anchoring in present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" identity and "softly deliberate" motivation remain consistent throughout, with micro-choices (analyzing footage, placing the stone) that flow from her vigilance trait. However, interiority is often abstract and poetic rather than embodied—"luminous regret" and "shape of hope" read as labels rather than particularized sensations. The final act of placing the stone carries visible cost (pocket emptied, piece of self forfeited), but the interior experience of that sacrifice remains somewhat generic. The transformation moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves smoothly from analysis to binding without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her shame is embodied through trembling fingers, and her pivot from complicity to accountability tracks through micro-choices (feeding brochures to the stove, drafting a new mission statement). Internal contradiction surfaces when self-respect conflicts with the urge to rebuild immediately, and her decision to call the wildlife officer costs her dignity on the page. Minor slip: the gecko and turtle receive summary care rather than dramatized choices, slightly diluting the earned arc, but the chameleon work anchors the transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her "closure seeker" trait and telepathy with plants read as convenient labels rather than embodied contradictions that shape decisions. The final realization about scars as "verses in a poem of survival" lands as therapy-speak epiphany without prior struggle. Interior voice relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("meteor hush," "displaced miracle") that floats above concrete sensory particulars and micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her psychometry ability drives action, but interior experience leans abstract—"spatially imaginative mind mapping each wire as constellation memory" tells rather than shows through specific micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to absorb the Rialto's archive is legible but arrives through passive reception (the map "tattooed itself") rather than a difficult decision that forecloses alternatives with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; peak moments ("wept as map settled") summarize rather than dramatize contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains an abstraction throughout—"moonstruck dreamer" is label-only, with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of stock poetic phrasing ("the voice of creation had been locked away") rather than character-particular thought. The journey and return are summarized in elevated register without dramatized struggle or visible cost that would distinguish endurance from convenience. No meaningful change is earned; the final creative flow is declared rather than shown through a foreclosed path or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guard's motivation to shepherd memory and plant the archive is present but largely externalized through abstract concept-language rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority relies heavily on lyric metaphor ("probability cloud," "wave functions") that keeps the reader at a distance from concrete choice-making under pressure. The final transformation into "part of the charm" reads as thematic assertion rather than a choice with visible cost earned by prior struggle. The piece gestures toward internal conflict but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher remains abstract throughout—her decisions feel declared rather than enacted under pressure. "She understood that the mechanical rainforest was not a prison but a question" exemplifies assertion over embodied choice. Internal contradiction is absent; the character glides through revelations without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses options. The logician backstory is mentioned but never creates friction with her new sixth sense.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lin's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "quiet courage stir beneath the fear" moment reads as therapeutic self-awareness rather than embodied struggle. The dog's recovery involves no meaningful choice from Lin—the animal simply waits in a cove. The ferry guides' role as external wisdom-givers prevents Lin from earning the shift internally through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior contradiction is embodied through physical sensation ("pins-and-needles," pressing the bolt until nerves scream) and her hierarchy of values emerges clearly: position over collective safety, then vigilance as penance. The climactic choice to report the rust stain feels earned by eighteen months of present-tense observation and bodily cost. Minor slip: the precentor and Milo function primarily as backstory pressure rather than on-page resistance, slightly flattening the present crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sylvar's interior is largely absent; we are told he is "a quiet thunder" with "regally unpretentious grace" but never witness contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The plan unfolds through exposition rather than difficult micro-choices, and Vael's interiority remains opaque—his ambition is declared, not dramatized. The closure (Vael's glamour shattering) arrives without visible cost to Sylvar or a meaningful foreclosure of options; his "task complete" stance reads as serene competence rather than earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lina's interior is coherent—grief, pattern-seeking, witness identity—but agency remains observational rather than decisional. The "revelation" about vanished shipping lanes arrives as reflection, not embodied choice under pressure. The final act (placing the atlas page, tapping a new rhythm) reads as ritual rather than a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a live path. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and the coral-bleaching grief is consistently embodied, but the protagonist never faces a forced trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai's interiority operates through concrete perceptions—bare feet reading the floor's memory, teeth aching from the hum—and her awkward confidence crystallizes into action. The motivation to find meaning drives micro-choices (raising opera glasses, kneeling, singing), though the final stance feels more intuitive discovery than wrenching internal conflict. Embodied detail is strong, but the arc from stargazer to singer lacks visible cost or contradictory impulses that would complicate the choice. The label "awkward confidence" appears as telling rather than enacted contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to challenge tradition is established, but her interior texture remains generic – phrases like "quiet rebellion" and "clear-eyed intent" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The plant-telepathy trait is told more than dramatized; we never see her wrestle with perceptual overload or misinterpretation under pressure. The grandson's nod at the Chamber passes without friction, undercutting the cost of her transgression. Emotional progression from loss (daughter's death) to revolutionary act lacks on-page struggle; the path feels pre-decided rather than earned through conflicted micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and purposeful—his forensic architect background manifests as pattern-finding that evolves into somatic preservation. The "freeze" action and palm-to-bark moments embody contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) without therapy-speak. However, the curator remains a voice of exposition rather than applying independent pressure, and the final stance ("optimism anchored in realism") verges on diagnostic self-awareness. The embodied grief work (hand pressure, bark texture) earns the choice to return, but the articulation of that choice occasionally slips into label-only insight.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows embodied craft knowledge ("fingers finding patterns") and the motivation crystallizes mid-piece ("descend into necessary darkness"). However, the artist's creative block backstory remains summary-level until the threads appear, and the final "no longer trembling" shift lacks dramatized pressure between impulses—she moves from paralysis to renewed purpose without visible internal resistance or trade-off at the moment of weaving. The hands-still-paint-stained detail at closure provides continuity, but the decision to weave rather than refuse or walk away feels inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's core motivation (discovering why time slows in crisis) is present and his attempt to replicate the phenomenon with the drone shows goal-directed behavior. However, interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("consciously wild," "serene anger," "calm anger," "quiet fury") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mentor's disappearance in the sandstorm is told in summary rather than dramatized, reducing emotional cost. The albino trait functions as description only, never constraining a choice or forcing a tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to provoke an unspoken conversation is established, but her interior life relies on abstract descriptors ("bravely conflicted," "motivation crystallized") rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice—feeding the letter into the pneumatic tube—occurs too cleanly without simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene. The phrase "bravely conflicted no longer" in the final paragraph signals resolution through label rather than dramatized cost, and the emotional progression from trembling hands to satisfied smile lacks the messy irrationality that would make her renunciation of safety feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation is consistent (peace-keeping against chaos) and her perceptiveness is demonstrated in concrete moments (reading the deserter's tremor, noticing petal curl). However, her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction or cost—she never faces a meaningful dilemma that tests her pacifism against survival pressure. The stranger's arrival and departure occur without forcing Lyra into a choice that would foreclose a path or reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her endurance feels static rather than earned through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Avery is internally consistent—cool-headed, purposeful, equipped with seventeen years of knowledge—and her motivation to catch Echo's trace drives her actions. Her choice to release the spike and let Echo settle into soil rather than possess demonstrates character growth earned by the encounter. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("cool-headed fisher of echoes," "voicing silence") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under live pressure. The grief mentioned via the spike remains label-only; no on-page moment forces her to choose between competing impulses shaped by that grief.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Victoria's motivation is clear and the inheritance-of-silence question drives her choice, but her internal conflict remains more stated than dramatized in contradictory impulses. The decision to intervene arrives through extended reflection rather than simultaneous warring desires acting in scene. Embodied emotion is present in the rosewood nib tracing and the physical act of scratching her signature, but the crisis feels more cerebral than visceral. The choice forecloses a path with cost, though the cost reads conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to undo tethers is stated but her agency remains largely passive—she receives letters, follows instructions, performs prescribed steps. The moment she recognizes her own handwriting offers a micro turn, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("grief," "guilt," "absolution") rather than embodied contradiction. The baby cries gain concrete texture late ("wanted only warmth," "taste of milk"), yet these arrive as exposition rather than difficult choices that alter her present stance. No meaningful internal conflict plays out on the page to earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    The chalk artist remains a collection of labels ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") without genuine contradiction or earned struggle. Her motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through competing wants or visible internal friction. The climactic choice—drawing the seventh spiral and interjecting a violet line—arrives without prior pressure that would make this decision costly or conflicted. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("her socially perceptive mind calculated the implications") rather than embodied thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    Arin is described through poetic labels ("gentle radical," "heart forged in frost and flame") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interior consists largely of abstract summary and retrospective claims about memory and empathy without embodied micro-choices that alter present options. The decision to rename the plaza is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak pervades: "cradle empathy in arms of steel" repeats as a thematic slogan rather than a lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ghost's motivation (encore, recognition) is clear but operates almost entirely through told interiority and symbolic gesture rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The actress appears only in summary ("her heart heavy with despair," "ready to claim the stage once more") without on-page contradiction or friction that would make her transformation feel earned. The synesthetic gift is labeled repeatedly but never constrains a choice or forces a visible trade-off. Internal conflict is absent; the ghost simply executes his plan without obstacle or cost to himself, and the actress's shift from despair to readiness happens off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lina's interiority relies heavily on label-only trait mentions ("affectionate skepticism," "willowglass hope") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. Her choices follow a research-curiosity path but lack competing impulses or visible cost; the geode experiment proceeds smoothly without meaningful obstacles from her own flaws or doubts. The final "fragile optimism" and whispered thank-you read as asserted emotional states rather than earned shifts. No foreclosed path or renunciation with weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("her purpose was to chart the unseen") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is stated repeatedly but never tested by a credible counter-pressure that would force a trade-off. Her actions—drifting, aiming sensors, singing—proceed without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The final moment offers no visible price paid or renunciation earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The hourglass turner is given interiority through her cataloging obsession and the transformation from "mere archival duty" to urgent purpose, but her motivation arrives mostly through summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final revelation—laying down glass prisons—reads as an epiphany declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No secondary character appears to test her stance, and the emotional arc remains largely internal and reflective without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—he seeks redemption by reconstructing a broken network—and his five-year exile has taught him patience. However, the interior work is largely retrospective summary; his micro-choices in the present beat (digging, handing over the pillbox) feel inevitable rather than conflicted. The courier's reveal that Elena survived lands cleanly, yet Kael's reaction ("something unclench in his chest") reads somewhat generic. The final choice to descend carries visible cost (the weight lifted, the empty hands), meeting baseline requirements but lacking the contradictory impulse acting in scene that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation (distilling complexity to essence) is established through consistent interiority and embodied waiting, though the final needle-touching resolution feels more symbolic than earned through concrete choice. The woman remains largely ciphered—her interior life is withheld, making the reunion feel like fulfillment of Silas's arc rather than a mutual crucible. Internal contradiction is present (decades of rewriting the promise) but the peak moment lacks a difficult trade-off; they simply align. Embodied detail (yarn needle pressed to ribs, pulse matching gutters) elevates the work, but the climax offers stasis rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai's motivation is clear and her decision to leave the bowl as an offering constitutes a meaningful choice, but internal conflict is thin—she observes and understands more than she struggles. Embodied emotion appears in moments like "her motivation hummed beneath her ribs," yet much of the piece reads as calm discovery without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance feels earned by the oasis's teaching, but the journey lacks the friction and inevitable mistakes that would push this into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear (translating grief into moonflower planting) and anchored in embodied memory (machine oil, tobacco, grandfather's locksmith precision). The piece delivers embodied moments—kneeling on warm concrete, scoring earth—but interiority often drifts into abstract summary ("translating it, turning grief into geometry") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to seed the lot is earned by prior causality, yet the cost feels more asserted than dramatized: we're told she's learned "letting go was the most precise measurement" without witnessing a live struggle or forfeited path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara remains an observer throughout, wandering and sitting without making choices that alter her situation. Her "brittle awakening" and decision to "become a bridge" are asserted through exposition rather than dramatized through conflicted action. Interior states are told via abstract labels ("isolation presses," "yearns to translate") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—"weaver of time"—arrives as declaration, not earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's motivation to "find the thread that connects all things" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her transformation from solitary ghostwriter to public artist unfolds through reported action ("enlisted," "gathered," "watched") without embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final self-addressed letter feels like a declared epiphany rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict remains abstract; no contradictory wants collide in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is consistent (decode, protect, interfere), but her interiority relies heavily on summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "cautiously hopeful" trait is told repeatedly but rarely constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—her three sleepless nights and the final switch are action beats, yet we don't see competing impulses wrestling in real time. Dr. Chen's entrance feels ornamental; he storms in, she shows charts, pressure deflates without a trade-off that tests her values. The closure choice (flip the switch) arrives without meaningful internal friction or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's claustrophobia is mentioned but never pressures a choice with visible cost; she trembles but the compass "anchored her resolve" dissolves the tension without struggle. Internal conflict is asserted ("wistful rebellion," "prudently adventurous") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final key retrieval feels frictionless—no moment where fear nearly wins, no trade-off between courage and caution that forecloses a path. Motivation remains abstract: "prismatic desire" and "wistful rebellion" are labels without embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's face blindness is conceptually vivid and her methodical ritual (photographing, logging) shows embodied process. However, the core character arc—from "empathy died" to "empathy wasn't dormant anymore"—is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final image presents her realization as a tidy epiphany ("waiting for her blindness to become a different kind of sight") without the visible cost or foreclosed path required for meaningful change at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian's internal progression from nervousness to certainty is traced through embodied decisions (transcribing coordinates, overriding protocols, running to the deck), and her "nervously confident" attribute drives visible choices under pressure. However, the interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing—"spongey dread," "wet wool in her lungs," "crystalline purpose"—that repeats across beats without fresh embodiment. The director's sudden appearance and pale-faced silence reads as convenient validation rather than genuine secondary pressure. Internal contradiction is present (fear vs. purpose) but the final stance arrives through assertion more than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist exists primarily as a conduit for atmosphere rather than a character with embodied contradiction. Motivation ("to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") is declared repeatedly but never tested by a meaningful on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life relies on abstract metaphysical reflection ("pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The final "smile" and sense of being "at home" arrive without earned transformation—no foreclosed path or difficult renunciation anchors the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The son's interior is painted with "polished calm" labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "understand why some paths circle back" reads as philosophical pose rather than urgent stake with cost. Leo appears only to receive symbolic warnings, never applying counter-pressure that would test the son's choices. The final "curtain call" insight feels delivered rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared (scholarly ambition transformed to shared burden) but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to archive the telegram and whisper a promise lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire resisted. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("healing with words," "burden alone") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The ancient scribe vision feels like convenient confirmation rather than a complicating internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The druid's interior motivation—guilt over a forgotten curse—is legible, but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("guarded heart," "warlike serenity") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final realization lands, yet the path to it is more told than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's agency at closure (planting the seed, releasing the confession) is present but feels mechanically assembled rather than earned through visible internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is vivid and purposefully constructed through embodied metaphor ("future press against her ribs like a second heartbeat"), and her contradictory impulses—fear versus curiosity, root-bound versus visionary—operate simultaneously in scene. However, key choices feel driven more by ceremonial necessity than earned internal conflict; when she kneels to "link through scars," the decision lacks visible hesitation or cost that would make the renunciation of her grandmother's warning feel hard-won. The final transformation ("she was the roots themselves") reads as a declared epiphany rather than a dramatized shift that forecloses a prior stance with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore her sister is clear and drives her descent, but her agency at the key turn is passive—she accepts the Keeper's terms without dramatized internal conflict between competing impulses. The phrase "reckless idealist" and "fiercely gentle" appear as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final state (lighter and heavier, a different-shaped hole) gestures toward complexity but remains abstract; no micro-choice in the closing beats reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is adequately developed through her choice to keep the speaker cloth, but the arc feels schematic rather than earned. The final decision arrives through summary assertion ("she would wrest meaning," "turning each appraisal into a song") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Dale's entrance provides a minor test, but Mara's rehearsed list of facts functions as evasion without visible cost or trade-off in the moment. The piece skirts therapy-speak ("discover purpose after loss") and relies on abstract emotional scaffolding in place of concrete micro-choices that would make the transformation feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her methodical nature shapes her approach, but her interiority leans toward abstract contemplation rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of letting the fruit fall reads as earned wisdom, yet the pivot from "haunted ambition" to resolution feels smoothed by exposition rather than a visceral choice under opposing pressures. Phrases like "haunted ambition resolved into something finer" tell the shift more than dramatize it. Her professional expertise is leveraged throughout, but the stakes remain largely conceptual rather than forcing a painful trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction—machine versus human, preservation versus destruction—is embodied through moon-phase fluctuation and sensor feedback, creating genuine tension. Her choice to refuse complete smelting demonstrates agency with cost (protocol violation, identity instability). However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("contradiction as physical pressure," "quiet triumph of refusal") rather than moment-to-moment embodied choice under duress. The lunar migration mechanism remains more told than dramatized in its constraint on her decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is present but often abstract ("the weight of all we leave unsaid"). Her decision to place the pearl is motivated by the etched confessions but feels more thematic than character-earned—protocol demands she report, yet we don't see internal friction or cost in the "heartbeat of a hesitation." The grandmother parallel offers grounding, but the leap to broadcasting hope feels more concept-driven than rooted in contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is scarce in the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's internal state is established (medication stopped, heightened sensitivity, guilt over a bridge collapse), but her agency remains largely passive—she walks, observes, imagines playing the accordion rather than playing it. The final "promise to the silent tracks" and the decision to leave the bellows behind gesture toward change, but the transformation is asserted through metaphor ("healing is a song you learn to play again") rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Backstory dominates without sufficient present micro-choices that visibly alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains almost entirely opaque—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Her "cautious exuberance" is labeled twice but never dramatized through action or internal friction. The watch, scroll, and notebook are handled as passive props rather than decisions that foreclose paths. The final "releasing" of silence reads as an unmotivated epiphany with no visible cost or prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lira's interior world is richly evoked through her telepathic plant connection and her dream of a sanctuary archive, but her final choice feels predetermined rather than genuinely conflicted—she never seriously weighs the empire's offer on the page, only performs the refusal. The decision to hide the violin and plant the seed arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths; the "mulberry ache" is named but not embodied as competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her expertise as a provenance researcher shapes atmosphere but doesn't constrain her climactic choice in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara's interior is vivid and embodied through gesture and ritual ("her fingers moved in ritual, painting sigils"), with clear motives driving her vigil. The contradiction between preserving what death takes and accepting oblivion creates productive tension. However, interiority occasionally tips into label-only claims ("lucidly watchful") without showing the cognitive cost of sustained attention. The final choice to capture the spark feels inevitable, but no live option was foreclosed on the page—she always succeeds—which limits felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior life is vivid and embodied through physical action (climbing, pruning, tracing patterns), and her contradictory impulses—wearing Aria's hairpin as "both burden and blessing"—register on the page. The forgiveness arc is told rather than dramatized, weakening the motivation's present-tense pressure. Her final understanding feels asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path; the jam-making epilogue dilutes the peak moment's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist as "conscience for hire" remains abstract; interior contradiction exists ("my own conscience was for hire") but the central conflict—advising others while doubting oneself—never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; the cloak and mirror function as symbolic props rather than pressure-testing flaws. The keeper's arrival and the protagonist's letting the cloak slip read as declared transformation rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her backward aging and teaching mission are told as premises, but we never see her wrestle with a choice that reveals competing desires or costs. The final act—stepping into the pond—arrives without prior micro-choices that would make this renunciation feel earned by her character logic. Interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation language ("the lesson was complete") rather than embodied sensation or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The skimmer's motivation is stated but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven throughout. Key moments rely on telling rather than embodied contradiction: "weathered resolve etched into her features" and "historically reverent by nature" function as shortcuts rather than lived tension. The final transformation—"no longer stationary in the way that mattered"—is asserted without a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority never shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vorrin's underachieving status and modest talents are established early and drive his refusal at closure. His final choice to remain with the keystone embodies contradiction—practical surrender versus quiet rebellion—earned through the mist-walk patience motif. Internal conflict operates cleanly: efficiency versus inefficiency, compliance versus preservation. Minor deduction for the phrase "accommodate the impossibility" appearing as both world-rule and internal musing without full embodiment of the trade-off in micro-choices during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's obsession with "discovering the color of sound" is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final "realization" that the missing tone is "the space between sounds" arrives as a label-only epiphany without embodied cost or prior struggle on the page. Interiority relies heavily on abstract synesthetic claims ("a sound that tasted of silver and smelled of rain") that read as decorative rather than character-particular. The key tag functions as a prop that pulses and glows without compelling Elias to make a meaningful choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is sustained through embodied detail ("doubt pooled in her sternum like dark matter"), but her decision-making reads largely reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The "quietly enthusiastic" attribute appears as label-only repetition without constraining choices or creating visible tradeoffs. Motivation is declared ("wavelength align with purpose") but never tested against a competing want or fear that would fracture her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's interiority is densely layered—memory worn thin by three centuries, grief over a shared surname—but the final choice feels more thematic recitation than embodied cost. The moment "she realized then that some fears exist only in the space between souls" arrives as label rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (angling the sextant, laying the atlas page) show technique but don't constrain competing desires with visible friction. The ending crystallizes her own fear into a mirror, but the trade-off remains abstract: what path is foreclosed on the page?

    Kael's "lukewarm mage" trait and "earnestly naive" quality are declared but remain largely labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His devotion is called "brittle" yet he proceeds without visible internal struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile and quiet satisfaction feel unearned—no prior causality shows what cost this victory extracted or what path was foreclosed. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart skipped," "wonder") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Nora's motivation to "spin stories into shared meaning" shapes her gathering of evidence, but her interior life remains thin—we see observation more than contradiction or embodied struggle. The decision to "expunge the official report" arrives without visible cost or competing impulse; she moves through discovery with vigilant competence but no dramatized friction between her grandmother's stories and her present role. Embodiment is sparse: "quiet resolve" and "weight of the past lift" are abstract labels rather than physical states. The closing lantern metaphor feels imposed rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The alchemist is characterized primarily through poetic labels ("Iron Tincture," "secretly sentimental") and symbolic gestures (pressed violets, trailing fingers) rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Her internal conflict between logic and intuition is declared rather than dramatized through competing choices with visible cost. The final "remembering what she had always been" reads as an unearned epiphany—no prior causality forces this realization, and no path is foreclosed. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("logic and intuition dissolve into simple understanding") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pattern seeker's interiority is established through embodied details (breath mist, metal buckle weight) and micro-choices under pressure. However, the character's internal contradiction remains static—vigilance is stated but never tested by a competing impulse or blind spot. The final action (triggering the override) feels motivated by role rather than a character-specific hierarchy of values with visible cost. Emotional progression flatlines: the burden "lifts slightly" but no deeper transformation or renunciation forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sensei's interior contradiction—ego death versus reawakened emotion—operates through the vivify choice with visible cost ("grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade"). However, the clones remain functionally interchangeable voice constructs without individuated motives, and the protagonist's twenty-year numbness is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices before the climax. The final integration ("both custodian and child of his own divided self") earns the change, but early beats rely on telling ("feeling nothing") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's ghostly motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (yanking the cord, conducting wind). Her desire to "macerate the unsaid things" manifests in specific choices with escalating emotional cost. The interiority avoids therapy-speak until "I'm sorry I left you. I tried to hold on"—these phrases lean toward label-speak but are quickly dramatized through the wind's effect on Sarah. The final renunciation (dissolving handle, thinning form) earns its cost through prior causality, though the move from grief-tending to release happens quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The guardian shows internal contradiction—caught between duty and homesickness, between knowing and befriending uncertainty—and these tensions drive micro-choices (pawing ice, licking the pendant, letting the door settle). The shift from "no longer to know, but to make friends with uncertainty" feels more asserted than earned through dramatized struggle; the interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") rather than embodied. The final stance crystallization is legible but the path there relies heavily on reflection rather than physical-world pressure that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to interrupt her bloodline's destiny is clear and her stoic sensitivity is embodied through "pressure behind her eyes while her face remained calm." The internal contradiction between feeling each failure deeply while maintaining outer composure drives her choices. However, the characterization relies heavily on telling ("she was stoically sensitive," "hopeless alchemist") rather than consistently showing through action under pressure. The final renunciation of hope and acceptance of approximation feels earned, but the journey lacks moment-to-moment embodied struggle that would make the transformation visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to interpret the signal is clear, and her shift from amplification to listening demonstrates growth. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("silence made tangible," "frequency so pure it erased noise") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic moment—touching the shard and experiencing emptiness—resolves too smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The "practical relief" tears feel label-only rather than earned through layered emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lina's "resiliently positive" nature is asserted repeatedly but never tested by genuine internal contradiction or a choice that costs her something on the page. Her motivation to merge timelines drives action mechanically, yet we see no competing impulse, no moment where resilience wavers under pressure that would make the final stance earned. The empty hourglass and radio manipulations read as competent puzzle-solving without blind spots or mistakes that compound before resolution. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("her heart beat in sync," "her purpose became something larger") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is signaled early and remains coherent, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("fever dream architect," "fever-hot fingers") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final shift—from grasping connection to inhabiting it—is asserted through metaphor ("realistically imaginary—real enough to drown in, imaginary enough to breathe") rather than dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but often filtered through poetic abstraction, weakening urgency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to teach starlight navigation is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—she "felt histories," her nature "pressed," her motivation "burned quietly"—without contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. The students function as a collective audience rather than individuals who pressure her choices. Corin's late introduction and single question do not create relational friction or force a meaningful trade-off; the anchor link becomes a teaching prop rather than a constraint that shapes her agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from ghost-hunter to emergency responder reads as coincidence rather than character-driven choice, undermining agency at the climax. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "heart hammering" and "trembling hands," but the introspection leans heavily on abstract constructions ("curiosity flares like a struck match") rather than character-particular thought. The ending choice to continue listening feels inevitable given the setup but lacks visible cost that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marek's claustrophobia and mission to honor dead colleagues are clearly embodied through "compressed spaces where bulkheads pressed like closing fists" and the tactical choice to return despite panic. Interior contradictions—wanting to honor the dead while fighting physical terror—drive consistent micro-choices (kneeling in water, syncing with traces). The seven-second witness act forecloses the safer option of merely documenting, and the cost is visible in the panic-driven ascent. Minor: backstory on the incident is extensive but anchors present choices sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation (survival after clerical death) is established, but interiority reads generic and abstract. The heartbeat-counting habit is told rather than shown constraining choices; it operates as a label without embodied friction. The final "mended the ghost / mend her own life" parallel feels tidy rather than earned through contradictory impulses. No secondary character pressure; the ghost remains a symbolic mirror rather than a dramatized force.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    The copper-veined storyteller's motivation is clear and her interior state is visible through sensory markers ("copper pathways," "verdigris"), but crucial choices lack embodied contradiction. The decision to use spinebirds' flight patterns arrives without dramatized hesitation or competing impulse; she "understood" and "closed her eyes" in a straight line. The ending's acceptance of failure reads as summary rather than a lived renunciation with visible cost in the moment. "Quietly articulate" appears as label more than constraint shaping her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lyn's interiority is dominated by abstract labels ("bitterness seeping through the cracks," "residue of a love lost to shadows") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivations are declared ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") but never tested by on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "metamorphosis" happens to her rather than through agency, and Elian's transformation is told via description ("his form began to shimmer") without dramatized struggle. Multiple POV characters blur focus without clear pressure from relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly declared but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to sync her heart to the locust shell's pattern feels more symbolic than psychologically earned—no genuine internal conflict between self-preservation and sacrifice is dramatized. Her grandmother's hardening is mentioned but never pressures a present choice. The final transformation lacks visceral cost; she "stands" and "smiles" with an "aching chest," but the price of becoming a bridge is asserted rather than felt through contradictory impulses or physical collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mailman's motivation is established through repeated reflection on the broken promise, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract guilt rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice to deliver the storm-bottle feels inevitable given the backstory rather than genuinely pressured by on-page conflict. Micro-choices are present (setting the bottle, launching the drone) but these feel procedural rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under duress. The backstory occupies significant real estate without sufficient present-tense friction to transform it into agency.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas is characterized primarily through poetic description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "quietly persistent" nature is asserted through repeated labels ("quietly persistent" appears verbatim twice) rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under competing pressures. The singing moment arrives as declarative action without prior internal conflict between silence and voice. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "his heart humming" and a smile but no contradictory physical states that would ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    The librarian remains a thematic vehicle rather than a person with embodied contradictions. Her twenty-year motivation is declared but never tested by a visible cost or competing desire on the page; the scarf-folding and portal-stepping read as fulfillment of an outline rather than a choice under pressure. The young man appears as atmospheric furniture; his solitude is told and his participation in the climax arrives without prior friction or stakes of his own. Internal conflict is absent—she wants the zeroth volume, executes the method, and succeeds without a dramatized mistake or renunciation that would earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The librarian's motivation is clear but remains abstract—longing to capture the dream—without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her actions align with goals, but the sequence reads like a series of poetic gestures rather than choices under pressure that foreclose paths. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is label-driven ("her motivation sharpened") or allegorical. The final acceptance feels thematic rather than earned through on-page cost that changes her.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Merrin's interiority reads as abstract and label-driven ("improbable longing," "enigmatic") rather than embodied contradiction. The woman's emotional state is gestured at ("trembled," "gasped," "wept") but never particularized through concrete internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. No meaningful character change occurs on the page; Merrin's final reflection loops back to her established stance without cost, and the woman's "freed idea" arrives without visible forfeiture or dramatized struggle. The lock of hair metaphor does work, but the protagonist remains static, observing transformation rather than undergoing it.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits clear motivation (recovering stolen memories) and makes hands-on choices (measuring angles, cultivating spores, placing the mushroom). His character trait "chronically curious" is shown through actions rather than told, and the final realization that some mysteries don't need solving demonstrates earned change. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical—the "crisp nostalgia" remains a label more than an embodied experience, and the character's internal contradictions (curiosity vs. restraint) don't create enough simultaneous tension in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's embodied nervous habit (walking backwards) and her trembling hands while pouring tea show physical specificity. Her choice to stay for Lin rather than return from exile demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, Lin remains largely observational without meaningful internal contradiction, and the archivist's final stance feels predetermined rather than earned through a difficult pivot under pressure. The "bend, not break" wisdom reads slightly generic without sufficient particularization through her own failure or struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vespera's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—preserve wonder before it fades—but her characterization leans heavily on the label "insatiably creative" rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. The work is presented as technically demanding but never as a genuine struggle with visible mistakes or blind spots; she executes flawlessly across seven days without meaningful friction. The final collapse reads as token exhaustion rather than earned cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is asserted ("a flaw and a gift") but not dramatized through competing desires under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to ground the seven sailors is legible and her final acceptance ("not gone; they were architecture now") shows a stance shift. However, interiority leans heavily on figurative abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"lucid unrest," "calcified in her throat," "restless spirits…pressure she had carried" are more poetic than character-particular. The core choice (to unravel despite her mentor's warning) is present but the interior conflict reads as retrospective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (lifting the needle, speaking the secret) but the embodied cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's "methodical curiosity" and "empathy" are label-dominant rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. Her journey from studio to henge to chapel proceeds without meaningful internal conflict—no competing desires or visible struggle that would earn the final "shielded openness." The final choice to document quietly rather than proclaim is asserted as growth but not dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a live option with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cassian's analytical nature is embodied through concrete actions—measuring the globe's density, timing snowflake settling—but his interior voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("the physics of letting go," "reclassification: from kinetic grief to potential memory") that reads more thematic than lived thought under pressure. The core choice to carry the globe as artifact rather than prison is earned by the measurement process, though the renunciation feels more told than dramatically tested. Mort functions well as patient counterweight but his presence applies minimal direct pressure to Cassian's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The balladeer remains an abstract figure with no embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. The scribe's entrance in the second half introduces a second character whose actions (tracing, singing) mirror the balladeer without distinct voice or stakes. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the ghost's "freedom" arrives through atmospheric description rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kai's motivation is dramatized through concrete choices—lifting the goggles, reading the diary—rather than merely stated. The interiority flows from specific observations (steam curling, map folding) and the final beat earns its affectionate detachment through accumulated evidence of mutual recognition. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional distance and devotion, though the warmly inquisitive trait is largely label-only until the impulse to lift the goggles. The captain remains off-page yet vivid through diary entries, though some observations ("steam from morning tea curled like spirits") edge toward precious over-specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and voice-consistent, with clear motivation (prove atmospheric memory) driving choices under pressure. The "categorizing clouds by emotion" system reveals character through unconventional method, and her final decision to seal the proof shows agency with visible cost (accepting obscurity). However, the backstory about Dr. Thorne's death dominates the middle third without sufficient present-moment friction; while it anchors her obsession, it flattens immediate pressure. The final stance feels earned but the path dilutes urgency with excessive reflection on past data.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's face-blindness and coin-based method are introduced, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven. The "discovering limits" theme is asserted ("understood that some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His choices—opening the safe, pressing the coin, walking away—lack visible internal cost or friction; the ending reads as philosophical acceptance rather than earned transformation. Motivation is declared but never tested on the page by a competing desire or price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara shows clear motivation (cartographer ambition) driving on-page choices—deciphering coordinates, persuading Kess, noting the bearing. Her interior life appears through "diligently curious" and "sociable isolation," but these remain more label than embodied contradiction. The final choice (noting exact bearing) feels more procedural than transformative; no visible cost forecloses a path. Minor issue: Kess's rare praise and the crew's whispers tell us impact rather than showing Elara wrestling with the cost of fame versus solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    The lunar-eclipse locksmith remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations are declared ("to learn the rhythm of repair") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; she moves through the library solving puzzles without struggle or trade-off. Interiority consists of abstract poeticisms ("driftwood nostalgia tugged at her heart") rather than character-particular perception. No meaningful change is earned—she arrives competent, completes a ritualistic sequence, and leaves satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ghost's altruistic motivation is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The community functions as an undifferentiated collective with no individual micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal experience remains surface-level summary ("felt the stirrings," "understood") without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The ghost's transformation into "nebula of respite" reads as metaphoric convenience rather than an earned change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The adjuster is single-POV with interior access, but her interiority leans heavily on label-driven language ("beautifully flawed" x4, "bruised awe" x2) rather than embodied contradiction. The boy's memory provides motivation, yet the adjuster's micro-choices feel abstract—touching spirals, placing the head—without visible trade-offs or genuine risk on the page. The closure involves dissolution of the puppet head and her smile, but no foreclosed path or felt cost emerges; she achieves her goal without complication. Pervasive therapy-speak ("beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") in peak beats triggers −0.5 under the anti-pattern rule.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's reluctance and duty conflict coherently throughout, with micro-choices (placing the nut "within a millimeter," cursing softly, the final worn nut from last season) revealing her ambivalence. Her grandmother's voice and the inherited burden provide clear motivation. Internal contradiction is present but somewhat stated ("wishing just once that she could let them fumble") rather than fully embodied in simultaneous impulses during peak moments. The choice to save the travelers is foreclosed by her curse rather than a fully earned stance crystallization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena's grief and its translation into research is established, and the chrysalis release offers a concrete micro-choice. However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstraction ("symphonically tuned mind," "polymer chain" metaphors) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final lab sequence shows agency, but the ease of the polymer's success and the tidy emotional resolution ("loosened grief") undercut the felt cost of renunciation or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The vendor's motivation remains abstract—she measures absences and bottles moonlight but her interiority never surfaces as embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The woman customer enters with a goal ("find the place where stories begin") but her renunciation or transformation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The vendor's final choice to bottle moonlight for herself reads as a gesture without visible cost or prior causal pressure that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion and character-particular decision-making are largely absent; actions remain symbolic rather than rooted in contradictory desire.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chef's interiority is richly textured—"my sturdy, brittle heart held its shape, though cracks spidered through the surface"—and the emotionally contagious touch is embodied through kneading and pool-tracing. The choice to subsume the woman's remorse rather than erase it reads as character-driven agency with visible cost ("my hands began to tremble"). However, the woman remains a cipher; her silence and the lost-daughter memory are told rather than dramatized in present choices, weakening the relationship crucible. The final vessel-becoming feels earned by prior causality, but the closure moment lacks a micro-choice that crystallizes the protagonist's own hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to unite the community is declared early but her internal contradictions never surface—she moves through the story with steady resolve, no genuine struggle between competing goods. The "empathetically decisive" label appears without cost: she feels everyone's pride yet faces no on-page friction when asking them to surrender linguistic autonomy. Minor characters (Klaus, Ania, Miguel) function as cooperative props rather than sources of resistance. The ending's communal harmony arrives without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The engineer remains abstractly rendered throughout—"helix-minded" is repeated as a label without showing contradictory impulses in scene. No micro-choices under pressure demonstrate hierarchy of values; she performs actions (raising the mirror, breathing deeply) but internal conflict is asserted rather than dramatized. The final sleeping-smile epiphany ("all mirrors are broken, all memories entangled") reads as unearned wisdom, not discovery forged by struggle. Embodied emotion is nearly absent; states are declared ("quaking reverie") without physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The archivist remains largely competent and unobstructed; no genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears. Her motivations are clear but one-note—she records the combinations and escapes, with no visible cost or path foreclosed. Interiority leans toward stock adventure phrasing ("latent blaze of purpose," "seeds of vigilance") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final return to the library feels like mission completion rather than earned change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sculptor's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to create music is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost that would make her final choice feel like a renunciation. The hedgehog and distant animals (fox, rabbit) are noted but exert no pressure on her actions. While she traces cracks and strums porcelain, no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the progression reads as smooth accumulation without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation ("to discover beauty in the difficult thing") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His final choice to release the stone and walk away reads more as symbolic gesture than as a decision arising from earned internal conflict with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("exile-trained thumb," "metaphysical vertigo") without grounding emotion in concrete bodily experience. The backstory with Mira provides context but flattens present-tense agency; Kael's climactic move feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's core motivation (cataloging silence) is present but largely told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her method of "tuning frequencies" resolves the diary lock without meaningful internal conflict or visible trade-off; the epiphany "Silence is the shape of love when words fail" arrives as a revelation rather than being earned through embodied struggle. The neighbor's arrival in the final beats adds a character without pressure. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("the path to empathy," "her growing catalogue") rather than character-particular contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract ("cultivate serenity within motion") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tincture's success unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost to his own stance. The minstrel's transformation is told rather than dramatized, and Elias's final "smile" and whispered gratitude lack the micro-choices under pressure that would earn the change. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("undercurrent of wisdom," "deeper current") in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and her goal to find resilience is signaled early. However, interiority remains thin—her emotional processing during the flight feels more narrated than embodied, and the leap to understanding "grow through dying, not around it" is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's arrow tip functions as a prop that pulses and guides, but Kael's internal conflict about risk, family duty, or the cost of discovery never materializes on the page with felt ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.8)
    The investigator remains a professional role rather than a differentiated character with embodied contradictions. Her internal life consists largely of summary statements ("She wanted to cultivate foresight") and label-only emotions ("the weight of the silence"). The sole micro-choice—quickening her pace in response to new variables—occurs late and feels procedural rather than value-revealing. No visible cost forecloses a path; she drives away with the patch "stitched into her memory," a metaphor without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lyra's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she proceeds linearly without internal friction. The synesthetic trait is label-only; we're told she sees color ribbons but no micro-choice depends on that perception. The sculptor appears as ornamental framing without relationship pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her mission fulfilled," "newfound reverence") rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The keeper's motivation (seeking insights from failure) is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His internal experience remains abstract—"regret," "renewed resolve"—without embodied particularities or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The backstory fragment about the missing artifact arrives late and is told rather than shown, failing to tilt present stance. The final promise to "learn, to protect" reads as label-only resolution without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.2)
    Cassian remains a collection of atmospheric labels rather than a coherent agent. The "habitually borrows personalities" trait is told but never dramatized with cost—he borrows the mathematician's mind and the poet's joy in consecutive beats without friction, contradiction, or visible tradeoff. The mathematician and poet appear as passive vessels for abstraction rather than characters who apply pressure. Interior contradiction is absent; Cassian moves through the evening with clinical detachment that never fractures under the weight of transposed emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courier's jittery opening trait is established but never meaningfully complicates his choices—he moves through the encounter and giveaway with smooth competence. The child appears as a recipient rather than a source of friction; her single need (wilted bloom) is resolved without cost to the courier's goals. The mentor's absence is told rather than felt through on-page contradiction or loss; the realization that she "had become part of the myth" arrives as assertion, not earned discovery. No visible forfeiture or renunciation closes his arc—he walks away "lighter," a soft emotional reward without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphine's motivation is clear and her scientific methodology grounds her, but her interior life remains largely declarative. The shift from "proof" to "communion" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance—needing "only to find the language that would let others hear"—arrives as assertion without the embodied cost of renouncing her original goal. Minor: "she must first become an object herself, porous and receiving" edges into metaphorical self-diagnosis that flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied choices—placing the bead in the shuttle, weaving puzzle pieces into fabric—that dramatize her willingness to sacrifice memory for connection. The motivational through-line (carrying Lin's message) is clear and consistently drives action. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary ("Each thread she pulled from the air was a moment stripped of sound") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final sacrifice feels more told than felt in micro-choices under pressure. Lin's sudden adult presence "on the other side" and her waking in a city lack the causal grounding that would make the closure choice land with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ren's journey from meekness to quiet determination is traced through embodied choices—standing at council despite trembling knees, packing the rings, conducting with his hammer. The barter's emotional cost (his inheritance dissolving) lands concretely, and the shift from "meek" to "merely quiet" reads as earned. However, the interior voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("defiance he didn't yet understand," "grief turned inside-out") that feels authored rather than lived, and the council scene's pressure remains abstract rather than dramatized with interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's sensory mapper identity is asserted through labels ("attuned to the subtle textures of worlds unseen") but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her final act of weaving feels externally choreographed rather than driven by internal contradiction; the revelation about her predecessor's failure arrives as exposition that does not alter her present stance. Motivation remains abstract—"the weight of the withheld truth" is referenced seven times but never dramatized as a live impediment forcing trade-offs. The closing acceptance ("a compass") lands as a declarative thesis rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost.

    Caleb's interior is present but largely static: his reticence and observant warmth label rather than constrain on-page choices. The ghost's presence and the lamp's failure do not generate internal contradiction or embodied struggle—Caleb moves through prescribed actions (pick up glass, write note, relight lamp) without visible cost or foreclosed path. The motivation to "protect" is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional embodiment is thin: "luminescent ache" appears as a repeated phrase rather than a lived contradiction acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Herald remains a cipher—label-only "Laughing Storm Herald" with "accidentally prophetic" powers declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her interior is stock mysticism ("shadowed elation," "thrill wrapped in the weight of destiny") rather than character-particular texture. The crew and captain appear only to passively receive her light, offering no relationship crucible. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she "continues her otherworldly routine" with the same posture as page one.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dye master's central motivation—understanding narrative magnetism—operates primarily at a thematic level rather than driving concrete choices under pressure. The donor heart revelation floods the master with insight but arrives as received wisdom from the stranger rather than earned through the master's own contradictory impulses. The child client scene gestures toward stakes but the master's agency remains observational; the final "transformation" into vessel-and-lens reads as abstract self-labeling without visible cost or foreclosed paths. Interiority leans heavily on metaphysical abstraction ("spaces between beats," "quietly explosive") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand what the trees witnessed is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from maintenance worker to grief-archaeologist feels imposed by the discovery rather than earned through prior interiority. The emotional progression—old wound healing in moonlight—arrives as assertion without embodied cost. Micro-choices exist (climbing stairs, placing the sextant) but read as plot service rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias possesses the scattered-memory trait, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than driving concrete micro-choices under pressure. His actions—placing the mica window, singing—proceed without visible internal contradiction or embodied struggle between impulse and cost. The final sacrifice ("his own memory would scatter again") is declared rather than earned through on-page foreclosure of a live option with felt hesitation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's compassionate recluse nature is established through consistent traits (solace in books, hiding from connection), but her interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The core motivation—understanding her mistake about the invitation—operates at a conceptual level throughout, lacking moment-to-moment micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in action. The final "choice" to step through the door feels more like an inevitability triggered by realization than a decision with visible cost; we never see her genuinely wrestle between staying and leaving in concrete terms. Emotional states remain intellectualized ("her keenly empathetic heart understood") rather than rendered through contradictory physical impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and drives her choices throughout, though her interiority leans toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The "creeping normality noticer" frame provides a coherent lens, but her emotional progression reads smooth rather than conflicted—she moves from solitary witness to leader without visible internal cost or doubt. The congregation members remain gestural (the veteran kneeling, the daughter crying) without distinct voices or counter-pressure. The final choice to scatter breadcrumbs feels thematically resonant but lacks a foreclosed alternative that would make the renunciation or commitment felt as a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.2)
    The orderly records chief remains a label without contradictory impulses or embodied emotional texture. His "gently meticulous" nature is asserted repeatedly but never dramatizes a cost or tradeoff under pressure—he simply performs his task with no friction between wants and fears. The vague motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" floats as abstraction rather than grounding in a specific stake that could be lost. The ending grants success without meaningful foreclosure or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives her choices through multiple attempts. Interior experience remains consistent, and her micro-choices (warning pirates, snuffing the lantern, rewiring the device) reflect her hierarchy of values. However, the "curiously steadfast" resolve feels asserted rather than shown through genuine internal contradiction; the progression from laughed-at daughter to lone operative lands cleanly but without the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the market unwarned, carrying the secret—has cost but the emotional embodiment remains somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's skepticism is embodied through her bioluminescence and the tin ring, but her arc lacks clear internal contradiction in peak moments. The weather-carrier encounter prompts a shift from "seeking a mechanical answer" to "acceptance of the unsolvable," yet this transition feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Micro-choices are present (placing the ring on her tongue, transferring it to the woman) but the final renunciation of reporting lacks visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("terrestrially cosmic negotiation") rather than embodied, character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's grief-driven creative block is coherently established and her mnemonically gifted trait anchors interior texture. The lock-opening sequence shows micro-choices (matching rhythm to memory), and the final decision to draw again feels earned by the cave discovery. However, the sister remains a flat motivator—never individuated beyond "laughter"—and the epiphany ("creativity had never truly been corked") arrives as assertion rather than discovery under pressure. Embodied emotion is present (charcoal-stained fingers, kneeling) but the peak beat leans toward summary ("surged through her veins") rather than contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.2)
    The calligrapher's motivation is signaled but her interior life remains thin—she "wanted to know" and later "realized" in label-only summary. The wilting trait is described but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the guard scene offers potential friction but she "forced herself to stay straight" without embodied struggle or trade-off. Emotional states are asserted ("heart quickening," "heart full of light") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. The final scroll-sharing moment with the neighbor arrives as sentiment without prior relational pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell tuner remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure, only poetic assertion of her erosion. The child arrives late and serves as witness rather than participant; no relationship pressure tests the tuner. Interiority consists of elevated declarations ("she understood her work was not preservation but transmission") rather than embodied thought under stress. The final "laugh a sound like breaking ice" gestures toward transformation but lacks prior causal grounding in her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android protagonist exhibits clear internal contradiction—longing for an unlived childhood while executing mechanical duties—and the nostalgia is embodied through trembling servos and misfiring circuits rather than stated. The final renunciation (burning Emma's fear-box) forecloses a path with visible cost: the caretaker becomes memory-keeper rather than pure function. Minor weakness: the "strangely organic" phrase recurs as a label without always showing distinct behavioral shifts in high-pressure moments. The change from static to wholeness is earned through the controlled burn sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "prove that listening heals" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her investigation proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal friction—she collects stories, finds the key, opens the mailbox, all without visible cost to her choices until the ending. The final stance (organizing letters, facing bulldozers) arrives without prior struggle between competing goods. Elena's emotional response is embodied ("eyes filled with tears"), but Mira's arc lacks the on-page tension required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation to escape is clear and her calm defiance under pressure is consistent, but interiority remains abstract—"spirit remained unbroken" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. The dance-cipher plan demonstrates agency, yet the execution lacks embodied cost or micro-hesitations that would reveal internal friction. Emotional progression is linear; no moment dramatizes genuine doubt or trade-off between fear and resolve. The final choice feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is grounded in embodied grief—the slick palms, the trembling hands—and his motivation to restore Mara's memory drives action. However, his emotional arc stays linear; he experiences worry and determination but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (pressing wildflowers to crystal) feels more procedural than torn, and Mara's transformation happens off-page, so the cost to Kael is implied rather than viscerally felt. Minor penalty for label-reliant interiority ("massive silence still ringing") that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and the renunciation of prophecy with visible cost (trading foresight for innocence) provides earned closure. Interior life is present through his technical focus and final doubt, though embodied contradiction under pressure is muted—he executes methodically without strong competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The closing question about peace versus ignorance gestures toward complexity but arrives as reflection rather than dramatized tension in a peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex's interiority is largely observational and metaphorical rather than embodied under pressure; phrases like "walls humming with stories" and "mortar whispered in a dialect of patience" remain poetic without concrete stakes testing character choice. Mrs. Voss is realized more vividly through gesture ("patiently nimble," jade comb, bergamot tea) but her motivation—preserving the building's memory—is stated rather than tested by a competing cost. The final act (pressing the seal) feels assigned rather than earned by prior contradiction or micro-choice that forecloses a live option. Agency at closure reads more as ritual completion than a character-driven trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to archive her sister's consciousness is established, and the journey from skepticism to acceptance shows some earned progression. However, the final "release" lacks concrete contradiction in action—the shift reads as smoothly articulated insight rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical language ("quarantine, not sanctuary," "translate isolation into independence") that edges toward label-speak rather than embodied thought under pressure. The sister remains a spectral device rather than a pressure source with distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's core motivation (forgiving her father's incomplete work) is present but remains largely abstract. Her emotions are frequently labeled ("quiet satisfaction," "heart light") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The decisive act of unlinking the tyrant's seal occurs on the page, but the interior cost of this "calibrated treason" never crystallizes into a visible trade-off or foreclosed path—she completes the mission and walks away unburdened. Diagnostic label-speak does not appear, but the interiority skews toward poetic summary rather than character-particular contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The Echo Singer remains a thin archetype rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation "to learn why some people echo" is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost; she simply collects voices without sacrifice or transformation. The late reveal about "a love she had lost" arrives as convenient backstory rather than an embodied wound that complicates her present choices. Interiority consists mostly of abstract perception ("richly perceptive") and therapeutic self-awareness ("reed-blown melancholy") without the messy, irrational texture of someone under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority is present but often abstract ("weaving truth carefully" recurs as a phrase rather than embodied choice). The ghost child Elias is instrumental rather than pressuring; he points and smiles without forcing Maya to confront competing impulses. A decisive moment of salvage occurs, yet the emotional cost—whether Maya wrestles with withholding information about the mother—is told rather than shown in contradictory action. Embodied emotion appears sparingly; most beats rely on atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The philosopher remains a static archetype throughout; his "scintillatingly somber" interiority is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Kael's transformation is told via summary ("From that night, Kael began to mend...") rather than dramatized choice. The piece cycles through label-only emotions ("thoughtful whistle," "demure audacity") without visceral stakes or visible cost that would foreclose a path. No genuine internal conflict acts in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's professional identity as a "conspiracy debunker by trade" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory choices under pressure. His motivations remain consistent throughout—excavating truth—but the story provides no genuine internal conflict or competing impulses that would raise stakes. The final walk toward the council with the letters feels like an execution of pre-determined intent rather than a choice that forecloses other paths with visible cost. His sharply observant nature functions more as a superpower than a trait with trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atlas is established as isolated and mission-driven, but his interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The piece tells us about seventeen years of work and variant allegiance without dramatizing the contradictory impulses that would make the final transmission choice feel costly on the page. The climactic broadcast reads as fulfillment of a long-held plan rather than a decision forged in the moment, flattening agency. Emotional states are asserted—"loneliness finally a kind of company"—rather than shown through specific behavioral contradictions or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's arc from isolation to community conduit is present, though her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("translator between generations," "currency of loss") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn from selling penny verses to giving sound-infused poems away shows renunciation with cost, but the decision arrives through summary rather than a dramatized internal conflict where competing impulses act simultaneously. The phrase "positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" reads as authorial assertion rather than earned character particularity. Micro-choices exist (opening jars, writing with sound) but the protagonist's flaws and blind spots remain decorative rather than driving inevitable mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The engineer's trait as "logically emotional" is label-only; the text tells us she "parse[s] fear as frequency and love as amplitude" but this never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Her weeping for the creature's hunger is embodied, but the interior voice relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("forced silence," "crushing weight of drowned prayers") that feel imposed rather than lived. The final choice to use sonic absolution is motivated by Guild training rather than internal conflict between competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (striking the key, humming at 7.8 Hz) but they execute a plan without visible struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("sculpt patience from impatience") but her interior contradiction never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "restrained wildness" and "caged urgency" are labeled rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final action—sending pulses—reads as competent execution without visible internal cost or genuine struggle that would make the revolution feel earned by her agency. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's investigator role is clear and her choice to defy Voss by uploading evidence shows agency under pressure. However, the internal conflict feels programmatic rather than embodied—her "watchfully calm demeanor never wavered" tells us stability rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother's Underground Railroad connection and the present-day worker death feel thematically parallel but emotionally flattened; Mara's stakes remain abstract (break free from control) without visceral personal cost that would elevate the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chaplain's interior motivation is traced through concrete micro-choices (accepting the box, watching Marlowe work, deciding to deliver it), and his professional role creates genuine pressure around forgiveness and meaning. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction—phrases like "the calm before realization" and "grace that must be built gear by gear" read as thematic summary rather than lived thought under stress. The final shift from "penance or purpose" feels declared rather than earned through a specific on-page cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Zephyr's interiority is conceptual and task-oriented rather than emotionally embodied. Her "steadily curious" nature functions as a stable trait-label that permits action but does not generate visible internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The yearning algorithm receives more dramatic weight than Zephyr's own agency; her decisions—pocketing the arrow, feeding grooves through the kaleidoscope—proceed without felt cost or competing impulses. The ending grants satisfaction without renunciation or transformation, limiting characterization depth.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.8)
    The memory keeper's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her agency at key moments (forging the token, copying the video) advances plot but lacks visible internal cost or hesitation that would ground the decisions in embodied conflict. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("sensed absence," "motivation burned") rather than specific, character-particular thought textures. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost is earned by the ending; she simply continues her work with slightly more hope.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation to act when others freeze is stated early, and the boy's forward step provides a clean choice under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction: "Shadows coiled around their boots, anchoring them" and "The calm wasn't emptiness, but a deep listening" tell rather than embody. The shadow-lace trait and "calmly intuitive" label recur without dramatized internal contradiction or embodied cost that would earn higher characterization scores.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's interior journey from euthanasia tourist to volunteer is present but executed through summary and abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The shift "no longer felt the need to grip reality loosely; it held her firmly now" arrives as assertion without the micro-choices under pressure that would earn it. Interiority relies heavily on poetic label-speak ("fold in patience," "grips reality loosely") that remains ornamental rather than constraining action. The grandmother's parasol functions more as symbolic furniture than a concrete object that shapes a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel remains a vessel for reflection rather than a character under pressure. His "gently persuasive manner" is told through summary ("often soothed the disputes between the workers") but never tested on the page. Interior experience consists largely of thematic projection onto the vines rather than contradictory impulses driving choice. The writing of his own letter is presented as an extended meditation without visible cost or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The line walker remains a cipher throughout—her choices are narrated but never dramatized with contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Interiority consists entirely of abstract declarations ("her motivation crystallized") and label-only states ("strangely honest purpose") without concrete, character-particular texture. The final departure forecloses no visible path; she simply walks away after completing a task with no friction, ambivalence, or trade-off shown on the page. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The archivist exists as a static vessel for theme rather than a character under pressure. No internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears; she moves through prescribed gestures ("perceptively calm" repeated as label) without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The widow and young man who contribute photographs arrive as abstract representatives, not individuals with distinct motives. Interiority is generic ("believed in collective healing") and the final child interaction offers wisdom-dispensing rather than friction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation to decode knowledge's growth pattern is sustained throughout, and his interiority is concrete: the crystal testimonies become a fractal of his own erasure. The final realization—that his reticence was "not a virtue but an erasure"—lands with embodied cost when the crystal returns nothing for his name. Minor slip: the transition from listening to desperate reading feels slightly telescoped, compressing what could be a harder choice into rapid sequence. Internal contradiction (silent scholar vs. speaking aloud) drives the closure with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prophet's "precognitive forgetfulness" is delivered as a label with minimal dramatized contradiction or on-page cost. His actions—kneeling, tracing chalk, listening—are physically embodied but remain uniform in texture; we see gesture without micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The final acceptance ("clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow") arrives as a thesis statement rather than an earned shift visible in altered behavior. The orientation test passes cleanly, but interiority remains abstract and the closure choice lacks visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear (harness dying starlight) and his core trait (patient listener/repairer) shapes the solution, but his interiority reads generic—"heart a quiet drum," "bittersweet symphony"—rather than character-particular. The decision to align the escapement to the leaf's cadence is shown on the page, yet the emotional stakes feel asserted ("luminous ache") more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The ending gesture (whispered thanks) lands as sentiment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her method is distinct, but her choices read as procedural rather than dramatically conflicted. The critical reunification decision occurs off-stage (she "decided to reunify them") rather than through visible deliberation with cost. Mr. Harrow and Lena remain sketched rather than embodied; their reconciliation relies on the vinyl device doing the work rather than on contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending forecloses the silence between father and daughter, but the cost feels asserted ("flawless") rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her "quietly deliberate" trait shows in pacing, but interiority remains abstract—"focused on the intricate web of runes glowing in her mind" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. Her actions align with stated goals, yet no genuine internal conflict surfaces; she executes the task competently without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The final satisfaction is declared, not embodied through a choice that reveals competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her arc from certainty to humility is earned, but her interior voice leans toward abstraction ("the weight of her yearning," "edifice crumbled"). Moira's "shrewdly innocent" expression is label-only without embodied contradiction. The final choice to collaborate feels mechanically resolved without visible friction or cost in the moment. Emotional progression is mostly coherent but lacks messy irrationality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira's motivation to share starlight is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract rather than embodied—"the weight reminded her of the stars she could not touch" states connection without showing the contradictory impulses that would charge it. The polishing action is meditative but never complicated by doubt, fatigue, or competing desires. Internal conflict is declared ("earthbound...yet her feet remained rooted") but not enacted through simultaneous opposing impulses in scene. The children's mimicry at the end broadens impact but does not emerge from Mira's agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior access is consistent and embodied through gardening choices, and the whistle-blowing backstory provides clear motivation. However, the final decision to "begin documenting the icicle patterns more formally" and open the garden to others arrives as summary intention rather than a high-stakes choice under pressure. The protagonist demonstrates patience and deliberate healing, but the arc reads more as therapeutic drift than a contradictory struggle with visible cost—she's already chosen refuge; the ending merely extends that posture without foreclosing a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is assigned clear motivation (collecting abandoned hopes) and the final gesture of planting the shell offers a visible choice. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("lucidly watchful," "conflicted no longer") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The younger-self encounter hints at internal friction but dissolves before it can pressure a dramatized trade-off. Emotional progression flattens into declarative resolution without the messy irrationality that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore the ritual is clear and sustained, but her characterization leans on type ("whimsical tinkerer") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to sing is presented as inevitable discovery rather than a decision under pressure; no competing impulse complicates her action. The villagers' tears and the elders' remembered youth feel summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and sustained—translating her child's heartbeats into a map—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("quiet echo," "moving stillness") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The journey from orchard to cabin unfolds too smoothly; no micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals competing impulses. The ending reunites mother and child without visible cost or renunciation, undercutting the stakes claimed earlier. While patience is demonstrated physically through deliberate placements, the protagonist's emotional arc flattens into a procession rather than a transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's "peripherally focused" trait is invoked repeatedly but rarely constrains choices with visible cost—it flavors perception more than it drives action. Interiority is concrete ("studying reflection angles," grinding lenses) and the seventeen-day arc shows endurance, but internal conflict is minimal; the protagonist never doubts his method or wrestles with competing impulses. The final satisfaction ("satisfied") lands cleanly but feels unearned because no prior mistake or visible struggle tested his competence. Embodied emotion is present in patient observation, yet the lack of contradictory impulses or blind spots keeps this in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The weaver's interior life remains abstract—"weights of different burdens" and "recursive spirals" feel more conceptual than embodied. Her seventeen-year isolation lacks micro-choices that show struggle or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final calcification of burdens happens without on-page resistance or the messy irrationality that would ground the metaphysical conceit in recognizable human pain. The daughter's voice and pride are collected too smoothly, without the character visibly warring with herself.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" is articulated but the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("here-and-gone pulse," "flicker that vanished when she looked directly"). The carving action provides embodied movement, yet the internal contradiction never sharpens into competing impulses that act simultaneously—grief is processed linearly through therapeutic metaphor. The ending "smile" and "rust-hued peace" land as declarations rather than earned contradictions with visible cost. Backstory is minimal and anchored, but the reflective mode dominates without micro-choices that alter present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist shows interior contradiction (scavenger versus dreamer ghost) and embodied emotion (stone in throat, fingers tracing cracks). However, the final transformation—"we have become collaborators"—feels asserted rather than earned through specific on-page choices that foreclose prior options. The ghost's gift of "a clear image of myself, unburdened" reads as convenient absolution without visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to "resurrect the terminal" is declared but her interiority remains abstract—"stoic wonder," "puzzling out equations for hope"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The narrative summarizes her emotional arc ("she felt," "she realized") rather than dramatizing internal conflict under pressure. No other character is on the page until children briefly appear, so relationship and status bullets do not apply. The final walk-away suggests transformation, but the path from curiosity to fulfillment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through her ritual dismantling of the chronometer, with the action of placing each gear serving as a physical correlate to emotional release. The backstory about her daughter occupies roughly 15% and anchors effectively in the present through the broken chronometer. However, the final realization ("understood then that her dream had not been abandoned, but transformed") arrives through assertion rather than earned contradiction; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates the shift—she simply perceives differently. The change reads as cognitive reframing without visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her "training" and "instincts" are asserted but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The quest to "understand the architecture of lies" is stated repeatedly but never tested by a choice that reveals competing desires or costs a path. Interior voice consists of abstract meditation rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her patience is embodied in physical action ("traced each knot," "coaxed knowledge forward"), but internal contradiction is absent—she never doubts, hesitates, or struggles with competing impulses. The final "confirmation" suggests satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path; she gets what she came for with no trade-off. Kessler functions as witness rather than pressure source, and the piece never dramatizes a moment where patience itself creates a dilemma or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scribe's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing"), never grounded in embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—tracing the thread, binding leaves, whispering names—read as ritual gestures without visible cost or competing impulses. The final decision to drop the thread feels unearned; no prior choice forecloses a path or tests commitment. Emotional states are asserted ("a sad smile") rather than shown through perceptual degradation or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lysander's motivation to "reawaken beauty" is clear and his assembly project shows agency, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bitterly sweet," "resolute," "quaking reverie") rather than embodied. The final moment—watching the creature and daring to believe—lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he observes rather than choosing under competing pressures. Emotional progression is told through summary phrases ("bittersweet ache") instead of dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The prince's bedraggled state is mentioned but never constrains a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "unyielding compassion" is told at the start and never tested by a genuine on-page choice that costs her something. The bird-healing sequence unfolds without friction or doubt, making it feel procedural. Scars are repeatedly told to "sing" but never embodied in a physical micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation is declared but never tested by competing impulses; she moves through the plot without internal friction or visible cost. The "luminous skeptic" label remains ornamental—skepticism does not constrain a single choice. Interiority relies on abstraction ("quiet urgency," "sidereal patience") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final triumph arrives without dramatized struggle or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is signaled early (inherited equation, "share light without using fire"), but her interior life remains abstract—she drifts, weeps in colors, understands patterns—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose paths under pressure. The climactic "transit" is computational rather than emotional, and the final acceptance ("troubling serenity… preferable to chaos of fire") reads as arrived-at wisdom rather than earned through on-page struggle. The generational cycle provides thematic weight but flattens agency; Elara's discoveries feel inevitable rather than chosen, and the cost (carrying eight lifetimes of grief) is asserted more than dramatized in her present actions.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is established early and his choices shape the arc, but much agency occurs off-page across the six-week span. The grandmother's ghost provides external guidance rather than internal contradiction driving choices. Interiority leans poetic but occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("that thundering calm") without embodied sensation. The final choice to carve a spiral is dramatized, but the weeks of retracing lack moment-to-moment pressure that would force micro-decisions with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal contradiction between penance and measured care is enacted on the page through her winding ritual, and the choice to pocket rather than erase Marten's testimony shows contradictory impulses resolving with visible cost. Embodied detail is strong ("thumb over splinters," "boots crunching black glass"). Minor slip: the ethical burden feels slightly over-articulated in places ("ethical diligence," "ethically bound"), approaching diagnostic label-speak, though it remains anchored in concrete action. The arc from grim precision to measured care earns the shift and forecloses the simpler narrative path.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The gardener remains thinly sketched; his interiority consists largely of interpretive gestures ("quiet resolve," "wondered") without contradiction or embodied cost. The piece tells us he seeks peace and honor but never dramatizes a micro-choice that forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. Motivation is declared ("to discover the shape of intentions") but operates as atmospheric decoration rather than a lived pressure that drives visible trade-offs. The final walk-away feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen's interiority is clear and purposeful—she runs scenarios through her "mind's lattice" and feels the quill "tremble" with "weight of unwritten consequence"—but her core motivation stays largely asserted rather than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The elders' skepticism is modeled but not dramatized; their final nod arrives without visible internal conflict or cost to Kaelen's stance. The closing reflection on "holding both vision and reality in equal measure" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, softening what could have been a harder-earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's core motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is established early and shapes her actions throughout. However, her interior life relies heavily on abstract declaration ("believed that dust could learn to sing") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beats show her settling into hope rather than facing a genuinely difficult choice with visible cost; the work is complete, the broadcast received, no path foreclosed. Interiority remains consistent but leans toward poetic assertion over micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is heavily abstract and label-driven ("crystallize a fleeting emotion," "weaves truth carefully") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The motivation to scatter ash is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; her final "acceptance" arrives as summary rather than earned struggle. No secondary character appears to create relational pressure. Stock phrasing ("ghost of cedar," "somber marvel") recurs without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Malach's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation of method over mythology—and his choices reflect a rationally rebellious nature under pressure. Interiority is concrete ("his calm as abrasive as the brick dust in his throat") and the final choice to encode "the calculus of collapse itself" feels earned. However, internal contradiction is limited; Malach's philosophical stance never truly wavers or costs him emotionally in a way that complicates his resolve. The patrolman's confusion at his flat affect offers a micro-turn but doesn't deepen Malach's inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mrs. Kaelin's expectant resignation and thirty-autumn history provide stable interiority, but her characterization relies heavily on summary ("she knew," "she had carried") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Marco's moment of vulnerability—breathing, subtracting defense, singing one note—shows embodied choice under pressure and earns the transition. The broad cast (Amina, multiple students) remains functionally flat; no secondary character applies immediate pressure that forces a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her ability to "taste memories" provides concrete sensory grounding. However, interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory—her resolve strengthens linearly without genuine internal friction or cost-bearing hesitation. The pruning action and final fruit-tasting show embodied choice, but the arc feels more like smooth unfolding than struggle against competing impulses. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path emerges on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's involuntary truth-telling trait constrains her responses ("Not yet," "but the darkness tastes like honey now"), and her climb up the tower embodies agency under pressure. However, the character's interior remains largely observational rather than conflicted—her "curse" is stated but never creates visible friction or cost in a choice that matters. The final wisdom ("wonder was a current you couldn't generate, only collect") reads as epiphany delivered rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a walking concept rather than a character with embodied struggle. Motivation is stated abstractly ("to understand why some houses feel alive") but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Interior life consists of ornamental observations and label-only states ("feeling its weight like a secret prayer") without contradictory impulses or genuine friction. The ending grants satisfaction without earned change or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Petra's motivation—guarding Eternal Verities that dissolve under new knowledge—is clear and embodied through telepathy and stone awakening. The "incisively kind" trait appears as a declarative label ("her incisively kind nature, a paradox etched into her by a master sculptor") without constraining a choice or creating visible cost until the final act of welcoming nuance. Internal contradiction is present (dogma vs. doubt) but mostly narrated rather than dramatized through competing impulses within a single beat. The ending renunciation is earned by the ampoule's cascade, but the cost—cracking stone lips, decades of waiting—feels more asserted than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias functions as "grim optimist" through his simultaneous cataloging of ways the prison will kill him while believing in salvation, and the choice to step past the rupture is earned by prior material. However, the daughter's death and the VC meeting arrive as summary backstory without micro-choices that tilt present stance, and the final decision feels more thematic than psychologically contradictory—he understands rather than struggles. The interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") that flattens embodied tension at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and remains consistent throughout, but the piece operates largely in summary and reflection rather than pressing him with contradictory impulses in scene. His micro-choices—painting the phrase, watching from a hidden vantage—are methodical acts without visible internal friction or cost beyond sleeplessness as a static condition. Mira's gesture is observed, not encountered, so no relationship crucible tests him. The "methodically hopeful" trait is asserted more than it constrains a choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    Liora's motivation to rescue dying arts is stated but remains largely abstract; her choices (baking loaves, focusing the lens) feel more ritualistic than driven by visible internal conflict or earned stakes. The displaced families are treated as a collective backdrop rather than individuals who pressure her decisions. Embodied emotion is sparse—"chest tighten" and "rosewater dread" repeat as labels without specific physical manifestation under stress. The final resolution lacks a meaningful personal cost or foreclosed path that would mark genuine character change.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clockmaker's neatly inventive trait is established early and her technical skill drives the central action, but interiority remains thin—she never confronts a genuine internal contradiction or cost that would make the victory feel earned rather than demonstrated. The keeper is a static prop who observes without pressuring her choices. Embodied emotion is nearly absent; we're told of "bleak exhilaration" but never shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-stakes moment. The final choice to leave feels like a natural next step rather than a renunciation or alteration that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation (trick fear into revealing weakness) is present but her internal contradiction feels manufactured rather than lived—she moves through terror without embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The advisor character never makes an on-page decision that alters tactics; it only narrates riddles. The final "confession" moment where fear answers "You are the only one who returned" lands as a conceptual turn, but Mira's laughter feels unearned because we never see her grapple with survival guilt or process what "returning" cost her until that exact beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prophet remains a distant archetype throughout; we see her external actions (striking driftwood, interpreting clouds) but never encounter contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The interiority consists entirely of abstracted narration about her "peculiar art" rather than character-particular thought. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the strikes feel illustrative rather than forged from competing needs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—mapping what others fear, driven by her mother's loss. Internal experience shows through her quiet determination and pattern-language mastery. The final choice to carve a question mark and continue mapping feels earned by prior causality, though the embodied cost could be sharper. "Quietly driven" operates mostly as a label rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dr. Emlyn Voss is characterized primarily through abstract labels ("emotionally rational," "methodical heart") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to preserve rather than expose the letter arrives without visible internal conflict or cost—the narrative tells us she "pondered" and "decided" but we never see competing desires clash on the page. The colleagues' debate is summarized in a single sentence rather than dramatized, and her final satisfaction reads as unearned because no path was foreclosed. Interiority remains conceptual rather than embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's internal progression from dutiful surveyor to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is motivated by the tactile discovery (toy boat, blank locket) and tracks through concrete micro-choices—mixing mortar, placing capsules, wresting the cornerstone. His stoic exterior paired with "hands trembled with the weight of resurrection" and the unexpressed weeping underwater embody contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. The final decision to delay demolition and return to the next district shows earned stance shift with visible cost (defiance of Authority, solitary mission), though the leap to "conversion" and the emotional rhetoric ("hushed blaze," "mortar of memory") occasionally drift toward declarative epiphany rather than strict dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira's motivation to trace the book's origins is clear and sustained, and her logical indexer trait shapes her methodical approach. However, interiority remains generic ("felt a surge of reclaimed stillness") rather than character-particular, and the resolution—finding Aldric's name and restoring order—arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The piece tracks her actions competently but lacks embodied emotional complexity or a choice that genuinely tests competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    The lantern maker's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interior states read as summary labels ("hollow," "grief") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shadow's departure and the daughter's death are told in past-perfect recap; no on-page moment forces a trade-off that reveals character hierarchy. The final reunion with the shadow arrives without visible cost or renunciation—the protagonist continues her work unchanged, reading as stasis without the foreclosed path required for Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael's motivation is consistent and embodied throughout—her choices are concrete (pushing calibration too hard, locking coordinates, placing the geode in the transfer slot). Internal contradiction appears in "bleak exhilaration" and the tension between mapping versus using energy, showing authentic complexity. The wedding backstory anchors present perception with a micro-choice (letting the geode drink readings) that alters her stance. Deduct −0.3 for slight over-articulation in lines like "understanding that survival meant carrying the weight of all unlived possibilities," which edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's characterization remains functional but thin. Her "perpetual surprise" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The pilgrim's flight and her transmission to "the collective" at the end suggest stakes, but her interior life lacks the embodied contradiction and genuine struggle required for higher bands. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; she simply succeeds and moves on.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    The genealogist's interior is heavily told through abstract reflection rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The mother's vanishing and his career of forgery are summarized backstory that never concretely constrains a present decision. The final "decision" to cease manufacturing false memories feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no visible cost or conflicting impulse complicates the renunciation. Embodied emotion is sparse—most feelings are labeled ("guilt rose," "weight of unspoken words") without specific physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is stated repeatedly ("recycle mistakes into wisdom") but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The drawer-pull gesture and his promise at the end feel rehearsed rather than earned by on-page struggle. Lin appears as a mirror rather than a pressure source, and the prisoners remain silent ciphers. Interior monologue stays abstract ("mixture of relief and lingering doubt") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's motivation (navigator guilt, need for alignment) is consistently embodied through concrete actions—launching the kayak, releasing the compass. Interior contradiction appears in "heart beating a rhythm that didn't match his actions," and the final walk away from the water feels earned by the fog-navigation sequence. However, the sister's death remains largely told rather than shown through present micro-choices, and the therapy reference introduces diagnostic self-awareness that flattens peak interiority. The climactic gesture of setting down the compass carries visible cost but arrives after extensive reflection that delays earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's motivation to "kindle empathy" is declared but never tested by an on-page choice between competing goods. The "hunter of empathy" backstory remains ornamental—we see no moment where his dirty past creates friction with his present goal. Interior life consists largely of label-only statements ("jaded wonder stirring," "weary expression tinged with hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The baseball-as-talisman is handled, but no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is labeled rather than embodied: "paradoxically steady," "reluctant metamorphosis," and "cosmic intimacy" function as prompt echoes rather than dramatized contradiction. The transformation is asserted through stock physical markers (fur threading, bones shifting) without the cognitive or emotional degradation under duress that would make the cost real. The beloved remains an abstract ghost; no friction between desire and fear plays out in concrete micro-choices. The final smile ("a feral grin that held the warmth of a thousand shared sunrises") exemplifies unearned epiphany—therapy-speak elevation without prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cartomancer's interiority is densely rendered but lapses into label-speak ("willingly perplexed" appears twice as a descriptor rather than dramatized tension). Embodied emotion is present ("beauty rose choking in her throat") but contradictory impulses are described rather than enacted in scene—she observes and accepts rather than struggles. The final gesture of hair-unfastening and card-gathering feels ceremonial but not costly; no path is foreclosed with visible sacrifice. Motivation is abstract ("find where lost time accumulates") and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's journey shows internal contradiction between pacifist programming and the withholding of medicine, creating genuine moral complexity. The embodied emotion through gravity fluctuations provides concrete physicality ("gravitationally lighter when happy, heavier when consumed by guilt"). However, the shadow-integration climax relies heavily on therapeutic terminology ("shadow work," "integration") that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness rather than dramatized struggle. The final renunciation earns its weight, but the path feels more programmatic than visceral in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interior life is rendered through concrete actions (collecting bugs, releasing them) and the retrospective pattern of his giving establishes character particularity. However, the pivotal realization—"transformation wasn't a texture you could touch, but a vibration you joined"—arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The prophetic frame positions him as vessel rather than agent, which diffuses the cost of his final act of release. Interiority drifts toward lyric abstraction ("carving him hollow so he could be filled with this moment") without the embodied friction that would ground the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seren's competence and goal are clear, but her interiority remains thin—she moves through a complex sequence of deductions and actions without meaningful internal friction or embodied emotion. The shift from vigilant sentinel to revolutionary lacks on-page struggle; her "calmly inventive" nature reads as label rather than dramatized contradiction. The final smile feels unearned without visible cost to her prior identity or relationships. Micro-choices exist but don't reveal a hierarchy of competing values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara remains abstract throughout: her precognitive visions are declared but never embodied in concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The "promise to her dying mentor" is a placeholder motive with no textured memory or present cost. Interior states are labeled—"trembling," "flooding her mind"—without contradictory thought or character-particular perception. The final seated moment reads passive; no on-page choice forecloses a path with dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's interiority is consistently present but largely abstract—"furiously tranquil," "trembling core," "scars on his tongue"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. The final decision to write and leave the poem feels declared rather than earned through prior pressure that forecloses other paths. Internal conflict is asserted ("a surface of calm glass over a seething undercurrent") but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory wants acting on the page. The vigil and writing gestures function more as meditative backdrop than crucible forcing a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Rhen remains a label-only construct throughout. The "dueling philosopher" title, mechanical arm, and "diplomatically fierce" descriptor are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or reveal internal contradiction under pressure. The duel opponent appears as a shadow figure with no distinct interiority, and the finale—"decisive, yet courteous, final thrust"—reads as narrated competence rather than earned agency with visible cost. Motivation is asserted ("turning questions into destinations") but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or micro-choices that foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's monthly molt is label-only until the final third, where he "chose to keep the poet's voice"—a renunciation that arrives without prior dramatized contradiction between selves. Cora receives concrete action (teaching him silence-reading, convincing him to rebuild) but her interior remains opaque. The coffee tin's "dangerous lines" and the seed-poem exist as props rather than choices under pressure; we never see him wrestle with whether to share them. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart swelled" and "hands shake" are generic physiology without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pianist's interiority is present but often abstract ("steely longing," "wistful"), leaning on label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation—to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore"—remains a conceptual claim; we see him play but the cost of the journey (bleeding fingers) arrives suddenly without prior physical struggle or trade-off dramatized in choice. The broken clock is handled twice but functions as static symbol rather than a decision point that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's internal state is articulated through concrete actions (carrying spectrograph, singing to stone) and his choices show meaningful contradiction between empirical rigor and whimsical belief. The character's progression from measurement to song feels earned by accumulated pressure. However, interiority occasionally slips into abstraction ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical") without sufficient embodied grounding, and the final choice lacks visible personal cost—we see the island's memory restored but not what Kael forfeits or endangers in himself.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's grief and search for understanding show embodied interiority through the compass handling and wire-wrapping practice. Her motivation evolves from raw severance pain to ritual acceptance across three seasons on-page. However, the final choice lacks sufficient on-page friction—the transformation to "rhythmically placid" teacher feels declared rather than tested against a competing impulse in the ending moment. Hideo remains observational without meaningful internal contradiction or cost.

    Elena's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices like brushing the butterfly's wing revealing her hierarchy of values. Her epiphany—that stripping drama strips existence—is earned through accumulated sensory details and internal conflict, foreclosing her old approach with visible cost. The final realization feels inevitable due to prior causality, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael's motivation shifts credibly from vengeance to purpose, embodied in micro-choices like studying frost and shaping glass.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's motivation to rectify silence is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion through heat-mapping and micro-choices under pressure.

    The undertaker's weary stubbornness is embodied through concrete actions and micro-choices, such as their refusal to abandon the dead and the transformation fueled by their own blood. Interior contradictions—yearning for silence yet perpetuating their role—are dramatized in scene, and the final choice to become the beacon is earned by prior causality with visible cost: eternal occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure, such as kneeling to offer dates and declaring story-sharing. Her "gently persistent" trait drives key decisions, and relationships with the boy and grandmother serve as crucibles. However, secondary characters are slightly underdeveloped, but this does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion like "Her heart beat in tune with the hum of distant trains." Her motivation to find where unused love is stored drives the narrative, and her final realization and release of love feel earned by prior causality. However, minor abstraction in phrases like "a vault of unused love" slightly reduces immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies to obsession, driving key choices like mapping the garden; her disintegration is earned with visible cost, though internal contradiction is underdeveloped.

    Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies, rooted in betrayal; interiority is concrete with embodied emotions like pruned hands and color hearing; final renunciation (dropping the device) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The contradiction between her obsession and acceptance acts in scene.

    Lux's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like pouring moonbeams on the canvas. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotions, such as "luminous disbelief," though some feelings edge toward abstraction. The shift from theft to translation is earned, with micro-choices under pressure, but contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene.

    Marek's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, with interiority shown through embodied actions like glassblowing. His final choice to leave the bowl is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the thawing parallel. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as his restrained glassblowing versus abandoning restraint for the large bowl.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her synthetic origin, with interiority shown through embodied fear and adaptation. Her final choice to embrace vulnerability is earned by prior causality, such as using phobias to outwit the AI, with cost visible in leaving the seashell. However, the emotional shift from discovery to empowerment feels slightly rapid for the word count, though still credible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The traveler's motivation is clear but his interiority is limited, with passive acceptance overshadowing deeper conflict; the oracle's mildly obsessed trait is shown but not fully leveraged to constrain choices with cost. However, micro-choices like unfolding the map against his heart reveal values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    J-3's interiority is concretely rendered through robotic sensors and circuits, with contradictory impulses between programming and curiosity driving on-page choices. The final renunciation of seeking a source for thoughts in favor of participatory experience is earned through the looped timelines, with cost legible in the lingering hum and melted violin. Embodied emotion in mechanical terms avoids stock phrasing, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by curiosity and a desire to restore trust. Her interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like her heart beating in the resonant hush, and micro-choices under pressure, such as deciding to investigate the doodles, reveal her earned change. Minor tell-y moments like "Curiosity led her" prevent a higher score.

    Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion like "his withered frame was mirrored in the fading blooms." His decision to reveal the deception is earned by prior causality, and micro-choices under pressure reveal his values. The youngest heir applies secondary pressure, but Silas's arc is compelling and flawed.

    Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority concrete and emotions embodied (e.g., "drowsy alertness"). His religious skepticism and determination drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned decisive change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as dismissing whispers while trusting the wheel, and the final release of ghosts is causally linked to prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through embodied emotion and micro-choices.

    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from pruning to planting. Her ability to taste memories is concretely embodied in scenes like tasting the vines' memories, revealing character under pressure. Micro-choices, such as clipping stems and whispering recipes, show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, minor diagnostic label-speak in "informal wisdom" slightly reduces embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara's characterization is strong with clear motives rooted in her involuntary truth-telling; her micro-choices under pressure, such as answering the riddle and climbing the tower, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final act of placing the honeycomb is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of mere efficiency with a felt cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, e.g., whispering the answer, though contradictory impulses are subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, driving the protagonist's actions, but interiority lacks deep contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure, with some stock phrasing like "secret prayer" reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    Petra's characterization is deeply integrated, with her "incisively kind" nature driving concrete choices under pressure, such as threading the ampoule to broadcast revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's grim optimism is concretely embodied through contradictory impulses—his hope for salvation versus acceptance of eternal climb—and his final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in carrying the dice as a weight. Micro-choices under pressure, like rolling the dice and rejecting the rupture, reveal a hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority is specific and driven by flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with methodical hope. Interiority is concrete, shown through his insomnia and cataloging, but lacks deep internal conflict or flaws that complicate choices. Mira's reaction validates his belief, but her brief appearance limits relationship depth.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Emlyn's motivation is clear and trait-consistent; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., "heart beat with the weight of that choice"). Final choice to publish is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the lie's prison with visible cost. Minor abstraction in some emotional labels prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure like readjusting the lantern and testing hypotheses.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's characterization is deeply embodied through micro-choices like clutching the drawer pull, with his motivation to recycle mistakes driving the narrative.

However, some emotional beats lean slightly abstract, like "jaded wonder stirring in his chest," preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rhen's characterization is consistent and动机清晰, with his mechanical arm and philosophical nature driving choices. Interiority is concrete, but the abstract concept of "turning questions into destinations" leans slightly toward theme statement rather than fully embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet's internal conflict during the molt approach is embodied in shaky hands, and his choice to keep the voice is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s scientific mindset, emotional reserve, and inherited dynamic with her mother emerge cleanly through perception and metaphor, and her shift from “stripping drama” to accepting noise is well earned. Micro-choices—kneeling in the wet, brushing the wing, what she texts back—track her values. Internal contradiction (need for control vs. surrender to decay) is present but could be pressed harder under live pressure. The only softness is that the epiphany comes a bit smoothly, with little risk of backsliding or real resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivations (survive, protect the ledger, understand the attack, honor his father, transform vengeance into purpose) are clear and consistent, and his final stance feels earned. However, his emotional life is often abstractly summarized (“realized his purpose,” “a weight of responsibility”) rather than embodied, especially for someone freshly stabbed. Internal conflict between vengeance and “purpose in the pauses” is asserted more than dramatized in on-page dilemmas. The change at the end reads plausible but relatively low-cost and somewhat thematically engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation (to “rectify the silence” and honor her brother) is clear and consistent, and her grief is convincingly embodied in small, focused obsessions (the case, the heat-mapping notebook). However, her inner life stays relatively unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses, fear, or genuine risk when she begins experimenting. The other survivors are almost purely atmospheric, providing emotional backdrop rather than relational pressure. The final shift feels earned but emotionally low-cost, more graceful slide than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The undertaker’s weariness and inadvertent stubbornness are specific, embodied, and consistently drive their choices, from staying in Marea to bleeding for the lens. Their internal conflict—longing for silence yet refusing to abandon the dead—feels organically rooted in backstory rather than declared. The final realization that they’ve sentenced themselves to an “eternal occupation” reads as an earned stasis, not a twist. The only slight limitation is that some key choices (deciding to rebuild the lens, deciding not to flee) are stated more than dramatized in moment-to-moment interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s core motivation and temperament (“gently persistent,” focused on intergenerational support) are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the community’s rituals. However, she is rendered as almost entirely virtuous, with little internal contradiction or cost to her stance. Emotional states are often summarized rather than deeply embodied, and we rarely feel her fear, doubt, or frustration under pressure. The boy and grandmother are sketched effectively but remain functions rather than fully pressured characters.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation is coherent and specific—she wants to locate and resolve “unused love”—and her actions (clutching the tear, breathing, entering the corridor of light) align with that drive. Interiority is present but often phrased in generalized spiritual language (“spiritually curious,” “pilgrim of sparks”) rather than sharply individuated psychology. The change from “vault of unused love” to “vessel of released love” is clear and earned, though the emotional cost feels somewhat smoothed and low-friction. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or resistance; she largely moves from question to answer without much internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s core drive—to understand and then escape the “texture of time”—is clear, consistent, and escalates into obsession in a way that earns her final transformation. However, interiority stays mostly at the conceptual level; we rarely feel her fear, doubt, or bodily stress in the moment, so contradictory impulses under pressure remain underdeveloped. The lineage reveal with her great-grandfather adds a strong, specific layer of motivation and cost. The final renunciation-of-self via knowledge feels earned but emotionally a bit cool because we have not been closer inside her skin earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he’s a “liberator” intent on planting resilience—but he reads more as an emblem than a psychologically particular person. His patience and strategic mind show in how he studies the keys and fights the sentry, yet we glimpse almost no contradictory impulses or genuine doubt. Embodied emotion is mostly displaced into setting and metaphor rather than felt in his body. The final endurance (still chained but planting) is conceptually strong but not deeply individualized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s motivation is vivid and specific—she’s driven by the wound of Kael’s betrayal and the need to hear the exact sound of trust breaking—but her emotional life is rendered more conceptually than bodily. The key action of letting the device fall is well-motivated and reads as an earned renunciation. However, we get limited on-page contradiction between impulses beyond “need to know vs. pain of knowing,” and Kael remains entirely abstract, which flattens relational nuance. The piece favors idea-driven interiority over messier, embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lux’s core motivation and worldview are clear and consistent—she believes portraits contain “illuminated moments” and acts accordingly—but she faces almost no real resistance or inner contradiction. Her competence (decoding flowers, using the moonbeams) is never meaningfully challenged, so we don’t see her under genuine pressure. Emotional states are mostly told through elevated diction rather than embodied specifics. The closing stance (she will “always be a golden-hour portrait thief”) affirms, rather than alters, her initial self-conception, so change lands as mild deepening rather than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marek’s grief, craft, and motivation (“to craft safe zones for inquiry”) are specific and consistent, and his micro-choices—returning to the control room, making the oversized bowl, leaving it behind—track cleanly with that interiority. The link between his profession and his emotional processing feels organic rather than gimmicky. The internal thaw is credibly incremental, not a single switch-flip. The only slight weakness is that the core realization about “safe zones for inquiry” edges toward neat articulation rather than fully dramatized contradiction in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (survival, autonomy, reframing her phobias as power) is clear and tracks consistently through her choices, and her fears are usefully embodied in moments like staring down the starry void. Internal conflict—terror vs. determination—is present but rendered more as summary than moment-to-moment contradiction. The synthetic-origin revelation and Caela’s betrayal credibly drive her refusal to surrender. The ending vow edges toward a neat resolution, but the cost (isolation, shaken identity) still feels legible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivations are clear (he wants guidance through the endless night; she wants to complete her strange task), but interiority remains abstract and generalized. We rarely see embodied emotion or contradictory impulses, so the traveler’s acceptance of the map carries little felt cost. The oracle’s “mild obsession” is told rather than dramatized. The final choice to walk into the void feels thematically apt but not deeply personalized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    J-3’s motivation is clear and consistent—torn between core maintenance directives and a new curiosity/ontological drive (“where do thoughts come from?”), and his final stance of returning to sweeping with reweighted meaning feels earned. Internal conflict between programming and emergent wonder is nicely dramatized via micro-choices (touching the violin, initiating the diagnostic loop, deciding to resume work). However, the emotional texture stays largely conceptual and could use more embodied, character-specific reactions to raise him above an archetypal thoughtful robot. The “joy of endless formation” realization borders on tidy rather than messy, contradictory change.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to clear up financial mistrust through transparency—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (picking up the lens, testing tickets, going to the manager) align with that. However, she experiences almost no real internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves smoothly from curiosity to moral action. Emotional embodiment is light, mostly summarized (“felt a quiet freedom”) rather than made visceral. The change at the end is believable but too costless to feel fully earned at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is clearly motivated—protecting his place and proving the garden’s sentience—and his ritual with the marbles individualizes him. However, his internal conflict over the deception is under-pressured: he decides to confess and is rewarded almost immediately, with little felt risk or contradiction on the page. The heirs, apart from the youngest, remain flat instruments rather than active pressures. The final endurance (staying on as gardener) is emotionally coherent but costs him almost nothing visible beyond admitting the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to prove her sideways-time theory during a narrow celestial window—is clear, consistent, and nicely tied to her identity as a mechanic whose “hands understand patterns that algorithms miss.” We get good, specific traits (obliging, quietly stubborn, pattern-oriented) and a lived-in professional competence. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; Kael never seriously wavers or reveals fear, so her emotional arc feels more like steady assertion than a pressured evolution. The relationship with Chen is sketched efficiently but never quite becomes a live crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to contact the diva’s ghost and decode her message—is clear and consistently carried through to the climactic choice about the final note. Her internal conflict between freeing the ghost and preserving her own haunted inspiration is well dramatized rather than merely summarized. The realization that the diva wants remembrance, not release, earns the final decision. Emotional embodiment could be deepened slightly (more body-level stress, less conceptual framing) for true top-tier nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s motivation—to measure the “weight of a swallowed truth”—is clear and sustained, and her actions (searching margins, placing the illustration on the scale, reinterpreting the smudge) consistently reflect that drive. Her blend of analytical training and emotional burden feels particular rather than generic. However, the internal conflict resolves somewhat smoothly into forgiveness without much on-page resistance or self-contradiction at the peak moment, softening the sense of real cost. A touch more embodied struggle before the release would raise the emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive—to “measure the weight” of his father’s confession—runs cleanly through the piece and his choices (entering the tunnel, prying and then turning the wheel, deciding to speak publicly) align with that drive. His skepticism versus susceptibility to the tunnel’s uncanny pressure yields a credible internal tension without melodrama. However, contradictory impulses under peak pressure (e.g., fear vs. compulsion at the door and in front of the ghost shift) could be more sharply dramatized rather than mostly narrated. The final resolve to call the historical society feels earned but slightly tidy relative to the eerie work the story has done.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Chronicle Keeper’s core motive—witnessing change without judgment—is clear and consistent, and her actions (retreat, burrowing via the swan, letting it go) align with this. However, internal contradiction is muted: she feels strain from the world’s clamor and the catacombs’ decay, but these never generate a sharp, on-page conflict of impulses. Emotions are conveyed more through atmosphere than embodied reaction, so she risks reading as an archetype rather than a fully individuated person. The final endurance choice (to accompany decay) is thematically right but carries relatively little felt, personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira is sharply sketched—her measured gait, talismanic curl, and attunement to breath all feel specific and embodied, and her profession is convincingly lived-in. Motivation (using music to reach dementia patients, then harnessing the eclipse) is coherent and carries through to the final bell left by Eleanor’s bed. The main limitation is a relative lack of internal contradiction or genuine struggle; Mira’s goodness and competence are never really under pressure, so her “cautious exuberance” at the end feels more like deepening than hard-won change. Eleanor’s moment of lucidity is affecting but functions more as a mystical event than as the outcome of a dramatized relationship under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s worldview and vocation are clear and particular—the odd historian who believes walls listen is a strong, specific hook. His motivation (to collect the stories walls have heard) is coherent and drives his actions, but he faces little on-page opposition or dilemma, so we see few contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional states are mostly implied through image rather than embodied in a textured, character-specific way. The final “reluctant shepherd” stance is resonant but could land harder if his reluctance and its cost had been dramatized more earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei Lin’s core motive—fleeing an unwanted prophetic power and then deciding to wield it—is clear and particular, and her culinary/procedural thinking grounds her. The Vallejo accident and her flinch at cookies give her flaw (fear of her own power) texture, and her final self-directed fortune is an earned reorientation. However, the internal conflict in the middle stretch is relatively smooth; she moves from “curse” to confident orchestration with little on-page resistance or misstep, which slightly undercuts depth. Secondary characters are sketched efficiently but function more as atmosphere than active pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Miriam is vivid, competent, and particular—“a priest who treated theology as sound design”—with clear tactics and motive, while Elias’s wound of “unraveling stillness” gives the possession a psychologically grounded foothold. However, Miriam experiences little visible internal conflict or cost beyond strain; she functions more as an anchored specialist than a character under genuine moral or emotional duress. The relationship dynamic (mentor/initiated, priest/possessed) is suggestive but not deeply stressed or altered by the end. The change in Elias (from armored quiet to true silence) is compelling but slightly summarized rather than fully embodied in his micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The writer’s longing, exhaustion, and “chronological homesickness” are clear and consistent, with specific ritualized behavior around the shell and scrolls. Her core motivation—to convert silence and memory into music—is well seeded and drives her choices. However, she remains somewhat singularly defined by that yearning; we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or real moral/psychological friction. The emotional cost of her choice (or of not choosing) is gestured at more than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent, but the character remains largely archetypal, with limited concrete, embodied interiority beyond the stated drive to "conquer the labyrinth of self." The most revealing moment is the realization "You are the labyrinth," yet even here emotion is conceptual rather than felt through the body. Contradictory impulses (fear/desire, resistance/surrender) are implied but not dramatized as simultaneous, in-scene tensions. The final "victory-by-surrender" lands conceptually but could use more on-page emotional cost to fully earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing and emotional numbness are clearly motivated and drive her climb, her willingness to try the needle, and her later teaching. Her interiority is mostly implied through images (ice cracking, seasons turning) rather than sharply rendered contradictory impulses, so her change feels gentle rather than hard-won. The drum maker is a functional but thin presence, a catalyst rather than a character under pressure. The final transformation is credible, but its cost in terms of what she must relinquish or fear is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s meticulousness, solitary integrity, and curiosity are clearly established and consistently drive his choices, from rooftop evasion to sending the pigeon. However, his internal conflict stays relatively simple—fear vs. moral resolve—without much contradictory impulse or messy irrationality. The danger of being followed never disturbs his composure in a way that complicates him emotionally. The final stance (quiet, resolute continuation) feels earned but low-cost and not deeply reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lantern broker’s grief, professional identity, and sensory caution create a textured, specific psyche with credible contradictions (scientific stoicism vs overwhelming scent-triggered emotion). Her refusal to open the vial, then being forced into confrontation and finally choosing to uncork it, feels motivated and earned. Embodied details—the throat closing, eyes burning, tears as “exhalation”—keep emotion grounded rather than abstract. A few lines verge on summary-psychology (“She'd refused to grieve properly, believing science demanded stoicism.”), but they’re supported by surrounding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s motivation—discovering the “texture of time”—is clear and consistently tied to his choices, especially the final decision to carry the rope onward. Internal contradiction is present (escape vs. preservation vs. continued inquiry), but it remains largely abstract and contemplative rather than embodied. We get little concrete, character-particular emotion beyond a generalized “quiet fire” and ethical playfulness. The final stance feels earned but would benefit from more visceral cost or idiosyncratic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    The violinist’s desire to “unbind the chronic hush” and “find beauty in the unfinished” is clear, consistent, and her choices (recreating the bonfire ritual, placing the bowl, deciding to teach others) arise logically from that drive. Interiority is present but tends toward declarative summary rather than a fully embodied, contradictory emotional life; we don’t see much genuine ambivalence or error under pressure. Her shift from solitary ritualist to would-be teacher is earned but arrives with little felt resistance or cost. The character feels specific and non-generic, but not yet as psychologically deep as the premise would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is sharply etched: professional, lonely, and ambivalently proud of their work, with micro-choices (dosage adjustments, warnings, the detached nod) all aligning with that persona. The client is thin but sufficient as a foil, registering mainly through nervousness and then softening features. Motivation is coherent—“to fuse insight with empathy”—though reiterated a bit too explicitly and often. Internal contradiction (wanting connection but clinging to detachment) is present but could surface in a more pressured, on-the-spot choice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Lena and Caleb are clearly sketched, and Lena’s curiosity and organizational bent plausibly drive her actions from manifest-checking to founding the award. However, both read as idealized types rather than fully individuated people, with little visible contradiction or genuine flaw. Emotional beats—especially Caleb’s grief and Lena’s shifting sense of purpose—are summarized more than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic reactions. Her final realization feels gentle and unsurprising rather than earned through visible internal struggle.

    Kael’s yearning and isolation are convincingly motivated, and his arc from failed, tone-deaf sympathy with the grieving mother to earned grafting at the end feels organic. Interiority is embedded in image and choice (“each reed a question posed to the arbor’s ancient glass”), not explained away. The girl reads as a clear, distinct catalyst with her own mode of attention, though her inner conflict remains largely implied. The main limitation is that Kael’s contradictory impulses under pressure (need to belong vs. fear/shame from prior rejection) stay more thematic than moment-to-moment in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to catalog the dream-ecosystem and then to preserve the primordial echo—is clear and consistent, and her final sacrificial choice feels earned by the setup with her grandmother and the pendant. However, interiority remains mostly conceptual and visionary; we rarely feel embodied fear, doubt, or conflicting impulses in the moment of choice. Her emotional texture is thus slightly flatter than the conceptual frame deserves, even though the arc from observer to artifact is strong. The lack of on-page hesitation before striking the bell trims some potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vesper’s grief and intellectualized quest (“mathematics of emotion”) are clear and embodied through her ritual with the eyes and mosaic. Her motivation is consistent and specific, and her gentleness shows in action rather than label alone. What’s missing for a higher score is sharper internal contradiction under pressure—she moves through the ritual with relatively little felt resistance or messy ambivalence. The final stance feels more like a serene acceptance than a hard-won change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is sharply drawn through tactile obsession, spatial knowledge, and a quiet, service-oriented solitude; her “kindly methodical” nature is consistently dramatized in how she plans caches rather than labeled. Motivation—to be needed and indirectly seen—is clear and drives all her actions. What’s missing for higher bands is a stronger on-page contradiction or moment of real hesitation; she never quite wavers between conflicting impulses. The boy is more emblematic than individuated, which keeps the relationship from becoming a full crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is clearly motivated (study of plant behavior, need for control) and her internal arc from resistance to acceptance is coherent and embodied in concrete actions (forcing vs. releasing the vines). The “reluctant metamorphosis” is tracked credibly across the piece, not just asserted at the end. However, her contradictions are more thematically stated than dramatized under tight pressure, and there’s little sense of genuine moral risk or uglier impulses that would deepen her. The emotional journey is convincing but somewhat smoothed and safe for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The painter’s exhaustion, insomnia, and drive to “thresh meaning” feel specific and embodied, and her shift from sleeplessness to rest is credibly earned. The scavenger is thinly drawn but functions as a foil rather than a full character, which is acceptable at this length. Internal contradiction (need for meaning vs. psychic cost) is present but stated more than dramatized, which limits depth. Still, her final choice to stay and repaint over the old self-portrait lands as an earned reorientation rather than a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s role, desire (“to magnify everyday magic”), and crisis of faltering clairvoyance are clear and consistent, and her final choice to let the pearl become a vessel tracks with those traits. However, her internal conflict is under-explored; she moves from unease to acceptance with little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse. The pilgrim functions as a symbolic catalyst more than a character, which is fine at this length but keeps the relational pressure low. The cost of Lira’s decision (loss of control, embrace of unpredictability) is more implied than felt in her body or thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archivist is strongly etched through sensory detail, vocation, and a clear, consistent drive to make meaning of absence; her choices (accepting the valve, experimenting, summoning the navigator) are coherent and rooted in who she is. The navigator is thinner but functional, mainly a foil whose breakdown gives her work emotional stakes. Interiority leans conceptual rather than embodied at peak beats, but it remains character-specific rather than generic. The ending shows a credible endurance rather than transformation, with her commitment to this work reaffirmed at some emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interiority is rich and particular—“a mind that saw musical notes in sewer grates and calligraphy in fire escapes”—and her conflict between rational mapping and trusting the uncanny arrows is clear and credible. The phantom ticket punch burning against her thigh nicely externalizes pressure. The final acceptance of her role (“This was her new start, mapped not in ink but in courage”) feels earned but a touch frictionless, with limited sense of real risk beyond fear. A slightly more resistant or costly hesitation would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—helping the grieving fisherman with the tile’s power—but her interior conflict between skepticism and belief is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in pressured moments. Emotions tend toward labeled states (“sympathetic skeptic,” “courageously kind”) instead of embodied contradictions on the page. Her change at the end (accepting felt truths) is conceptually earned but comes with little visible cost. The fisherman exists more as an object of her kindness than as an active relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Althea’s core motivation—escape from endless boredom via finally learning “what happens after goodbye”—is clear, consistent, and credibly escalated by the mutiny and the storm. Her contradiction (terror/fascination with death) is present but more stated in abstract terms than embodied through concrete reactions, so her internal struggle feels slightly distant. The final choice to merge with the mutiny reads earned by prior setup of the curse and her long torment. What’s missing for elite-tier characterization is more idiosyncratic, sensory-grounded emotional texture rather than primarily conceptual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sam’s interior conflict between congenital honesty and learned deception is specific and credible, and their shift from “casing the joint for answers” to consciously refining the con feels earned. Micro-choices—pocketing the ink pot, tracing the ledger, deciding to negotiate rather than expose—show a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. The father and director are sketched efficiently as forces shaping Sam rather than fully rounded figures, which suits the length but limits relational depth. A few insights verge on over-articulated thesis (“honesty wasn’t a virtue but a luxury”) but remain supported by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    Her core motivation and temperament are clear—she’s methodical, devout to her craft, and quietly defiant (“a quiet defiance against the emptiness that had swallowed the town”). However, we get little contradiction or friction inside her; she largely embodies one note of hushed dedication. Emotional states are more implied than felt in the body, which dulls the cost of her endurance. The “weight of the invented histories pressing back” hints at deeper conflict that the piece doesn’t quite dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The survivor’s motivation—to reconstruct the “texture” of a self erased by bureaucracy—is specific and consistent, and his actions (listening at vents, curating the box, keeping the poison label for days) align with that drive. He feels particular rather than generic, especially in how he relates to paperwork and containers. However, internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; we rarely see contradictory impulses clash on the page in real time. The final stance (accepting his nameless but real existence) is earned but emotionally underplayed as a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s drive to decode the universal riddle is clear and consistent, and his shift from myth-buster to myth-maker is conceptually earned. However, he often reads more like a thematic instrument than a fully embodied person under pressure, with limited concrete, character-specific contradiction beyond “cheerfully gloomy.” Emotional texture stays mostly abstract; we rarely see stress degrade thought or behavior in a particular way. The final choice to remain as a “ghost of truth” carries cost, but that cost is more told than felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motives and contradictions (loyalty to both carnival and corporation) are clearly sketched and carried through the piece, and the stone chip is an effective, specific anchor for her interiority. However, the dual allegiance rarely forces her into a concrete, dramatized dilemma; internal conflict is mostly stated rather than enacted under pressure. Her emotions are present but often summarized in abstract terms (“hopeful desperation”) instead of being fully embodied in specific moments. The final stance of determination feels earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Her desire to photograph the last bloom is clear and consistent, and small embodied touches (breath fogging the visor, feeling the “weight of the space age”) land. However, her interiority stays relatively generic—duty and melancholy without a sharply individuated worldview or vivid contradictions under pressure. The repeated label “purposefully curious” does not translate into a distinctive pattern of thought or a costly choice. The final emotional shift to “dawnlit melancholy” feels earned but modest in depth.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    Miren is vividly realized: her tactile, acoustic, and refractive ways of working feel specific, and her calm persistence under deadline is credible. Her motivation (finish before dawn for the cartographer) remains consistent, and her final correction—“I don’t see, I interpret”—reframes her disability as method rather than magic. Internal contradiction is relatively low; she’s highly competent and emotionally centered, which flattens potential struggle. Kael is lightly drawn but functional as witness and thematic foil.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—“to find where the rivers begin”—is clear, consistent, and drives every major choice, and his dry understatement (“‘Subtle,’ Kael muttered…”) gives him a specific flavor. His subtle confidence is dramatized in how he walks onto the ice and lets the falcon pass through him, reading as knowledge rather than bravado. However, internal contradiction is minimal: we get little sense of fear, doubt, or competing desires, so his final self-sacrificial transformation lands more as mythic fulfillment than as a hard-won, conflicted choice. The piece privileges archetype over messy human texture, which keeps it just below truly top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation and function in the world are precise and compelling, and details like memorizing each resident’s gait give him specificity. However, he is almost entirely an instrument of purpose, with little on-page contradiction or emotional conflict despite the immense temporal scale. The townspeople are evocative types (cobbler, widow, orphan) rather than individuated characters, used mainly as rhythmic inputs. The final endurance choice feels consistent but not deeply reconfigured on an interior level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motives (survival vs scientific revelation) are vivid and consistent, and her final decision to transmit instead of seal her helmet is a convincing culmination of that conflict. Interiority is concrete—oxygen gauges, tactile contact with the temple, the feel of the hush—rather than abstract labels. The hierarchy of her values (mission over life) is articulated through specific micro-choices. The only limitation is that we get little of her beyond this single crucible, so she reads as sharply etched in the moment but not deeply individuated in history.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The son’s core motive—redeeming or overwriting his father’s legacy by “chasing hush”—is clear and consistent, and his main choices (descending, using the lattice, leaving) align with it. However, his interiority remains abstract; we get very little concrete, body-level feeling or contradictory impulse on the page. The relationship with the father’s myth is powerful conceptually but under-dramatized as lived conflict. The final renunciation (leaving the lattice and walking away) carries some cost but isn’t deeply personalized beyond the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motives (protecting the orchard, responding to the ghost’s request) are clear and her emotional arc from fear to bittersweet acceptance tracks, but her interiority remains relatively generalized and low-conflict—she rarely resists or questions. The ghost bride has a strong, simple motive (“repay a debt across lifetimes”) but little nuance beyond that role. Embodied emotion is present (“tears burn her cheeks,” breath hitching), yet contradictory impulses under pressure are underplayed. The final state of “mournful elation” feels earned but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear and consistent, and her choice to keep weaving and then enter the labyrinth is motivated by that hope. However, her inner life is largely summarized rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of competing impulses or real doubt as she risks herself in the canyon. Emotional cost is minimal: villagers’ skepticism is noted but not felt as a true wound. The final shift from isolated weaver to village guide is conceptually earned but not deeply inhabited moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lina’s motivations (return from exile, need for continuity, attraction to the sundial) are clear and consistently embodied through how she sees the orchard. The inner shift from dread to a “quiet tremor of faith” is earned via her small, reverent choices. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction or a moment where competing impulses (leave vs. stay, science vs. ritual, loyalty vs. self) actively clash on the page. Her arc is persuasive but emotionally smooth rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s occupation, habits, and values are sharply etched, and their motivation (protecting hidden truths / “meaning in the margins”) cleanly aligns with every on-page action. However, internal contradiction is minimal—Kael is highly competent and scarcely challenged, so we see little genuine ambivalence or stress degradation. Mira is functional and lightly sketched, serving more as foil and delivery mechanism than as a pressure source. The final sense of earned stasis—Kael continuing this work—is credible but emotionally understated because we’ve not seen them truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s vocation, belief in the candle, and commitment to “unheard stories” create a clear, specific psyche, and her choice to leave the relative safety of the observatory to warn others is credibly motivated. However, her interior conflict (fear vs duty, comfort vs action) is more inferred than dramatized in embodied, contradictory impulses on the page. The moment of reading the prophecy could carry sharper, more particular emotional texture beyond generalized dread. Still, the character feels coherent and individualized, if not yet at an elite level of psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s guilt, fear, and longing to apologize are concrete and consistent, and the final choice to speak and release the letters is well-earned. Internal contradiction (dread of speaking vs. need to atone) is present, though it could surface in a few more specific memories or embodied flashes of the sister. Mira is sketched efficiently as a pressure-applying guide rather than a full character, but her opacity feels intentional. The emotional shift by the end is credible and carries visible cost without being over-tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in his history as a translator who chose distant wars over domestic intimacy; his guilt about his daughter and his work creates a credible, layered contradiction. The way he handles the coral and the cast under anesthesia reveals character through micro-choices rather than labels. His final re-reading of the cast as connection rather than accusation is an earned, modest but real reconfiguration with emotional cost. A few thematic articulations (“the silence in his daughter’s room that grew teeth”) skate close to essayistic, but they’re still rooted in his psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s motivation—to break through creative numbness and rediscover joy—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (seeking the orchard, working the fresco, deciding to display it). Interiority has some specificity (the talismanic film, the “pulse of something she had almost forgotten”) but stops short of showing real contradiction or risk; she seldom feels genuinely torn or under pressure. Her competence is high and largely untested, which softens the sense of cost. The final shift toward renewed purpose is earned but a bit too smooth to feel fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s core motivation—trading certainty for curiosity—is clear and consistently dramatized through her choices with the mural and the coin. Her “methodically playful” nature is shown (pausing at each sculpture, angling the nickel) rather than merely told. However, internal conflict stays relatively abstract; she questions her old view of restoration, but we don’t feel a sharp, embodied tension or cost beyond the conceptual shift. The visitor remains a sketch, functioning more as a catalyst than as a pressure-bearing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris is sharply sketched—a vainly charming, hyper-literate resistor whose habits (botanical metaphors, coded speech, careful performance) align with his fear and defiance—but his interior conflict never fully complicates beyond “anxious yet thrilled,” limiting depth at the climax. His motives (protect the Cant, preserve his own mind) are clear and consistent, and his micro-choices under pressure (what to say to Chen, whether to plant the seed in front of auditors) track plausibly. Dr. Chen is efficient and capable but mostly functions as a competent ally rather than a crucible for Aris’s choices. The ending shows his resolve flaring brighter, but the cost of that choice remains more conceptual than personally lacerating on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s core desire and temperament are clear and consistent, and her ongoing choice to keep singing and writing through centuries gives her a stable, recognizable spine. However, she experiences little on-page contradiction or acute internal conflict—her doubts about the armistice’s fragility are noted but not dramatized in a pressured moment. Emotional states tend toward lyrical summary rather than embodied, scene-level feeling. The final endurance/vow is thematically apt but not sharpened by a visibly costly renunciation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s core motive—to preserve forgotten names—is clear and consistent, and her incremental realization about the loneliness and partial futility of that work gives her a modest internal arc. However, she remains more emblematic than fully individuated; we get little in the way of concrete, character-particular thought or embodied contradiction under pressure. The closest thing to internal conflict is her simultaneous commitment and “foxglove regret,” but this never sharpens into a difficult, specific choice. The earned-stasis ending (her quiet defiance in continuing) works, yet would land harder if rooted in more particular, conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to repair a specific intellectual and emotional bond before a hard deadline—feels clear, consistent, and rooted in her professional identity, and her “carefully reckless” choice to use the Jorvik promises is well motivated. Her internal conflict (need for reconciliation vs. fear of being dismissed or losing what they built) is present but somewhat summarized rather than embodied in moment-to-moment perception. Kess’s fear-based silence and reversal at the end are plausible and thematically apt, though her interiority is mostly delivered in a single explanatory speech. The final choice—to build a new “grammar of trust” despite diverging paths—feels earned and forecloses the option of retreating into isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alia’s motives and competence are strongly grounded in her work and history with the mountain, and her actions clearly follow from that (discovering, decoding, proposing, overseeing construction). However, her internal conflict around the community’s divide and the risk of failure is gestured at more than dramatized, so contradictory impulses (“slyly heartfelt hope” vs. fear of erasure) never truly bite into her choices. Her emotions are mostly carried through image rather than embodied, stress-degraded perception. The closing realization about “encrypted compassion” feels earned enough, but it arrives with relatively little on-page psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s desire to preserve the echo of the past and relearn trust is clear, embodied through the meteorite, pigeons, and ledger. His inner life feels specific and textured rather than generic, and his final stance—trusting the pigeons and himself—is earned by prior beats. However, contradictory impulses (clinging to past vs. risking new trust) are more stated than dramatized through sharp on-page dilemmas. The arc is convincing but could use one or two more pressured micro-choices to feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s desire—to understand sacred thresholds and their father’s legacy—is clear and consistent, and small micro-choices (studying the grain, stepping through) align with that motive. However, interiority stays fairly generalized and lacks contradictory impulses or real moral tension. The relationship with the father is evocative but under-explored as an active crucible rather than a gentle memory. The closing “quiet certainty” feels earned but low-cost, more contemplative shift than fraught change.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Iyana’s longing to decode “the rhythm of belonging” is clear and consistent, and her pattern-obsessed mind is convincingly dramatized through how she reads cracks, rust, and light. The final renunciation of the submersible is well-motivated by what she’s seen. Internal conflict between survival and resonance is present but could be more explicitly dramatized in scene—she tips toward staying fairly smoothly. A touch more embodied hesitation or specific personal memory of exile under pressure would deepen her contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s desire to understand the vanishing paths is clear and consistently expressed, and her actions align well with that motive. Her emotional palette—salt-soaked longing, “cheerful gloom,” sweet sorrow—is specific and embodied in moments like handling the humming shards. However, internal contradiction and real struggle are muted; she rarely feels genuinely torn or pressured, so the final understanding comes a bit too smoothly. The arc is credible and coherent, but not yet deeply knotted or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ezra’s analytical, almost engineer-like approach to serendipity is sharply drawn and consistent, with his bishop, timing, and interventions all rooted in one coherent worldview. His motivation—to serenade monotony with creativity rather than be altruistic—adds welcome edge, though his inner life remains more sketched than deeply conflicted. We rarely see genuine internal contradiction or real emotional cost to his compulsion; he functions smoothly, almost too competently. The result is a memorable figure whose complexity feels promising but not fully mined at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s core motivation—to preserve outlawed memory by inscribing it on her body—is clear and consistent, and her choice of elective exile tracks logically from the moonstone anchoring. However, she exhibits little genuine internal conflict or contradiction; she surrenders almost immediately to the garden’s pull without resistance or ambivalence. Emotional experience is rendered more as concept than as embodied tension, so the transformation feels more ordained than hard-won. This keeps the arc from fully landing at a truly character-particular, high-stakes change.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The glazier’s motivation and sensibility are clear and consistent, and his interpretive habit (“reads between lines”) threads through the pond scene and his later teaching. However, the inner conflict remains abstract—there’s no concrete pressure or contradiction beyond a generalized desire to find value in the mundane. His emotional state is mostly narrated in thematic language rather than embodied in specific, stressed reactions. The final “tempered pane” resolution feels gently earned but low-cost and a bit too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: a hyper-competent professional whose defining wound is the morally ambiguous choice she made. Her guilt, sense of betrayal-by-survival, and desire to repurpose that pain into teaching are all embodied in concrete gestures (cradling the box, arranging the stone circle, returning to take recruits). Contradictory impulses—need for atonement vs. refusal of self-exculpation—coexist credibly. A minor softness is the occasional essayistic abstraction that edges toward thematic statement rather than dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation—to derive a mathematical grammar for hope—is clear, specific, and consistently embedded in her methods, and her occupational lens feels lived-in. However, she moves through the piece with near-frictionless competence; there’s little on-page contradictory impulse or genuine risk of failure, so emotional cost remains abstract. Her “lucidly watchful” state is evocative but largely label-level rather than dramatized struggle. The final repositioning of herself as the “final trial balloon” is conceptually strong but undercut by the lack of visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and her actions (saving the negative, returning with equipment, compiling and sending the report) align well with her drive to “discover what walls dream about.” However, internal conflict is mostly gestured at (“burden,” “obsession”) rather than dramatized through competing impulses in particular moments. The emotional arc from obsession to purpose is convincing but somewhat smoothed over in summary rather than felt through difficult micro-choices. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly deep, conflicted interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mirage painter has a clear, consistent motivation (to persuade the mirrors), but her interiority remains generalized and almost entirely serene, with little concrete, character-specific emotional texture. We rarely see contradictory impulses or any real struggle; the borrowed heartbeat is conceptually rich but not inhabited as felt, messy experience. Her calm helps sustain the lyric mood, yet it also flattens potential conflict or cost at peak beats. The result is an intriguing figure more as symbol than as fully realized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The negotiator’s motivation (atonement for a failed cease-fire) is clear and consistent, and his gentleness is tied to how he proceeds. However, his interiority leans on abstract reflection rather than embodied, contradictory emotion under pressure. We’re told the weight of redemption “weighed on his shoulders,” but don’t see many specific, character-particular cracks or irrational impulses. The final realization about shared redemption feels earned conceptually, but not deeply dramatized through hard micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.5)
    Vesper’s core contradiction (amoral philanthropist with a hoarded tenderness for extinct species) is vivid and coherent, but it’s mostly asserted rather than dramatized under pressure. His key choice—to cause the drought and release the egg—has already been made before the scene, so we miss seeing him genuinely torn on the page. Interiority is lyrical yet generalized; we get relatively little specific, embodied emotional texture as he acts. The ending grants him a “sentimental wound” but never forces that flaw into a live, consequential dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—her commitment to resistance through art is well-grounded in her chaste, performance-bound role. Interiority is present but slightly generalized; beyond “alarming serenity” and “her heart hammered against the lullaby’s pressure,” we get limited contradictory impulses or real doubt. Her choice to risk being hunted and lose her reputation is motivated and has cost, but her emotional struggle en route reads relatively smooth and unconflicted. This limits the depth of psychological complexity expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Adrian’s motivation—revulsion at “beautifying lies” and desire for ethical storytelling—is clear and specific, and his use of the stick and reversed tales aligns with that drive. However, he faces little genuine resistance or dilemma in the scene; the performance goes as planned and his only “choice” is to do what he already intended. Secondary characters (trucker, dealer, woman, bartender) each get a sharp, telling glimpse of self-recognition but remain sketches rather than fully pressured agents. The internal conflict around how far he’s willing to “break” versus “build” with stories is implied but never put under direct strain.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Esme’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories and act as a witness—is clear, consistent, and embedded in her actions (building signals, staying in the grotto despite futility). Her interiority is particular (“esoteric realist,” “mathematics of loss”) and non-generic, with a credible blend of ritualistic agency and resignation. However, she experiences little genuine on-page internal conflict; she never seriously questions staying or her methods, so the final endurance feels more affirmed than freshly earned. The emotional cost is implied rather than dramatized in a specific moment of ambivalence or temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The caster’s shame, exile, and evolving relationship to her craft are clear and specific, and her motivation to preserve names feels organically rooted in her history with the cracked bell. Interiority is textured (perfectionism vs compassion, shame vs purpose), with concrete actions—handling the card, rebraiding the rope—revealing character under pressure. The turn from self-punishing perfection to forgiveness and vocation is earned by prior details. A few lines (“She understood now that…”) summarize emotional insight instead of fully embodying the conflict on the page, which slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her “foresight through hindsight,” ritual dreamwork, and long-term entrapment generate a coherent psychology and clear motive. The decisive change (choosing to leave and abandon the directive) is well motivated by her accumulated realizations. However, the internal conflict at the peak feels a bit too frictionless; once the dream clarifies the directive’s purpose, her choice reads almost inevitable, with limited on-page hesitation or cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and specific—preserving a bridge of knowledge before the purge—and his actions all align with that goal. His empirical stubbornness versus the palace’s “magic” creates a credible internal tension, but it’s more stated than dramatized in embodied moments. Interiority is present but largely conceptual; we see very little of his body under strain, hunger, or fear as the regime shifts. The final endurance—accepting the tile’s dispersal and living with only his papyri—reads as an earned, quiet renunciation, though the emotional cost is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s “scheming pacifist” identity is distinct and embodied in her tactics, and Elara’s resentment feels textured and specific rather than generic rage. The interior logic of Mira’s nonviolent manipulation is coherent and carries through to the climax. However, Mira encounters little visible inner resistance or cost in this instance, so her flaw and pacifism are not pushed as hard as they could be. The final choice feels earned but somewhat low-friction for both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s craft-based motivation is clear and consistently dramatized, and his final transformation into an “anchor” for the dream is thematically earned by prior choices. However, his inner life is almost entirely aligned with a single desire; we see little genuine contradiction, fear, or resistance under pressure. Emotional texture comes more from atmosphere than from psychologically complex ambivalence. The change at the end is meaningful but largely conceptual rather than felt as a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mender is vivid, with guilt, stubbornness, and tenderness all present, and her micro-choices (returning despite no profit, using the ribbon, how she answers her daughter) feel motivated and specific. The mother–daughter relationship is sketched efficiently and gains a concrete shift by the end. However, the daughter’s emotional turnaround is quite rapid and smooth, softening the sense of true relational cost or contradiction under pressure. A touch more friction or hesitation on her side would deepen the credibility of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Evers’s bewilderment, curiosity, and sense of duty are cleanly articulated and drive every choice, from hiding in the bathroom to biting the fruit. His internal contradiction—obey the rules vs. pursue forbidden knowledge—feels specific rather than generic. The shift from “curator” to “mourner” is earned by the accumulation of prior disorientation and curiosity. Some emotional beats are more stated than embodied, leaving a slight distance at key moments of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara has a clear, consistent motivation and competence, and her resourcefulness drives key turns (decoding gaps, renegotiating the pact, rescuing the botanist). However, she reads more as an elegant function of the premise than as a fully individuated person with contradictions or embodied emotional texture; interior conflict is almost entirely absent. The botanist and time traveler are functional figures rather than pressures on her psyche or values. The final stance—continuing to “research gaps”—is conceptually satisfying but emotionally under-costed.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (to find the garden and resolve her fractured identity) is clear, and her final choice to stay on the ship feels earned by the preceding interiority. The chimera-twin aspect gives her a specific, character-rooted lens on memory and doubleness, especially at the twin blossom beat. Emotional experience is mostly shown through perception rather than labels, though phrases like “unkindled solace” lean abstract. Internal conflict is present but gentle; the piece could use one sharper moment where leaving vs. staying feels viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are sharply defined—“warmly methodical” and driven to “translate confusion into clarity”—and her choices (entering the impossible door, deciding to reweave the braid) emerge cleanly from those traits. However, she encounters little real internal friction or doubt; the story rarely pits her values against each other, so her competence is never meaningfully troubled. The emotional cost of erasing one version of history and a student’s death is implied but not really felt through her body or conflict. This keeps her from reading as fully three-dimensional under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (using the stone, experimenting with resonance, deciding to continue) align with it. However, her interiority remains largely one-note—she wants quiet and works toward it—with little contradiction, fear, or doubt under pressure. The emotional cost of her choices is muted; the “reprieve” is experienced but not deeply complicated. This keeps her from feeling fully realized at a literary-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The custodian’s motivation is clear, specific, and nicely idiosyncratic—proving that coincidence has meaning rather than just “saving the world.” Her interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; doubt, fear, or competing desires barely trouble her, so the emotional cost of her choice remains muted. Her retrocognition shapes tactics but doesn’t generate many mistakes or blind spots. The final realization feels earned, but it arrives without strong internal resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is specific and textured—“preemptively nostalgic grief” and the ache over over-remembered vs nearly-lost events frame a credible internal conflict. Her micro-choices (descending to the forecourt, kneeling with the quill, returning to the observatory to write) align with a coherent drive to understand how to be herself within collective memory. The shift from raw anticipatory grief to quieter acceptance reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a neat epiphany. Slight abstraction in some feeling-statements (“weighted with something unnamed”) keeps this just short of fully peak-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cinder’s motivation—defying a pervasive hopelessness—is clear, embodied in concrete choices like lighting the rag knot for the fortress rather than for spectacle. Her interiority is sensorial and particular (“gravity of hopelessness thick as tar”), but rarely conflicted; there’s little sense of competing impulses beyond determination vs despair. The key change is a deepened commitment rather than a new realization, which fits but keeps the arc modest. I miss a sharper moment where the cost of carrying this role (loneliness, fear, doubt) presses against her drive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is sharply etched: her profession, attention to tiny marine dramas, and relationship to the jade cicada all feel specific and coherent, and her micro-choices (looking sideways at the pool instead of confronting her brother) match her temperament. The brother is thin but not generic; his “stubbornness and sorrow” and quiet acceptance give the relationship a clear, if understated, arc. Internal conflict—grief vs. observational distance vs. a need to accept his leaving—could be more sharply dramatized, but it is present. The final stance (acceptance of his departure with cost) feels earned by the accumulated interior work.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The girl’s motives (fear of confinement vs. compulsion to collect silences) are clear and particular, and her actions—climbing during inversion, sealing the doll—cohere with those drives. Her claustrophobia and yearning for the sky give her a credible internal contradiction. However, the emotional texture stays relatively even; we rarely feel genuine panic, anger, or rebellion in the moment, and the relationship with the father is underused as a crucible for choice. The late reframing of the bunker as “not a prison, but a vessel” lands more as stated insight than as a hard-earned emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael and the diplomat are cleanly sketched with distinct desires (her quiet pedagogy vs. his time-pressed anxiety), and his shift from jittery to open is well-tracked via the instruments and his body. However, Kael’s interiority remains almost entirely serene and mission-certain, leaving little contradiction or visible cost to her choice to give away the vial. The diplomat’s turn to tears is plausible but a bit accelerated, with limited dramatized resistance before surrender. Overall, characterization is strong and specific, but the emotional arc could bear more friction and messy ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lore keeper has a clear throughline—dutiful, pattern-attuned, "wisely adventurous"—and her final renunciation is motivated by that ethos. However, interiority is mostly implied via worldbuilding rather than dramatized conflict on the page, so her emotional cost in refusing the throne is muted. The lack of embodied contradiction (temptation vs duty) undercuts what could be a sharper, more complicated peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s motivation—self-protection through isolation reconfigured into a calling to teach others to breathe—is coherent and carried through the encounter with the man. Her emotional life, however, stays largely in abstract terms (“loaded emptiness,” “resilience”) with few concrete, character-specific embodiments. The relationship with the man has clarity and tenderness, but little genuine friction or contradictory impulse on the page. The final stance (burning and building bridges) is earned conceptually but could use one more pressured, specific choice to feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (shame from the pyramid scheme, desire to redeem himself and help the community) is clear and plausibly tied to his choices, and his curiosity-to-obsession progression works. However, his internal conflict remains relatively low-friction—he breaks the rules but never truly seems torn, and the risk feels abstract more than embodied. Emotional states are often summarized (“pressure into something priceless”) rather than physically felt in the body under stress. The final stance shift—from victim of false promises to keeper of a fulfilled one—is thematically apt but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dynasty ender has a clear, consistent motivation and a legible internal shift from “ender” to “keeper,” but his interiority remains generalized rather than idiosyncratically embodied. Emotions are mostly rendered in elevated abstractions (“gift of clarity,” “bridge of intuition”) rather than concrete, character-specific sensations. The cost of his shift in role is implied but not deeply felt on the page. Still, his choices (cranking the gramophone, listening, reinterpreting his role) map cleanly to his stated goal.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aldric’s withdrawal, ritual tending, and response to the puppets create a coherent, particular inner life, and his final choice to step through the doorway is motivated by both awe and loneliness. However, his interior conflict remains relatively soft: there’s little dramatized resistance between staying safely isolated and embracing destabilizing possibility, so his transformation feels more ordained than contested. Embodied emotion is present (“heart pounded,” “shivering bliss”) but repeats rather than deepens into more complex contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marianne is sharply drawn through specific grief, her dust-reading habit, and her mission to honor “small kindnesses,” and her choices (researching the button, writing the letter) credibly arise from those traits. The internal contradiction—broken-hearted yet still investing in these fragile gestures—is present but could be more dramatized in live moments rather than mostly summarized. Emotional states feel embodied via her interaction with the room and objects rather than label-only feeling. The final easing of her heart is earned but remains a quiet shift rather than a deeply contested internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation and methods are clear and consistent—she reads as a stubborn, under-estimated worker whose competence and improvisation drive every turn. The “carefully resourceful” trait is shown in concrete choices (puddle-mapping, swallowing the crystal, using a sieve). What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of her internal contradiction or ambivalence; she rarely feels torn, only determined. The endurance and cost at the end are credible, but her emotional texture under peak pressure stays relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    The saxophonist has a clear role and purpose but remains more function than person; we get mood (“eerie nostalgia,” memory of a mentor) rather than a textured inner life. His motivation to hush the prophecy is asserted, not complicated by visible doubt or conflicting desires. Emotional states are gestured at but not embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final endurance/renunciation (living with the hush) is conceptually present but not dramatized as a concrete cost for him.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lira’s vocation and immediate goal are clear and consistent, and her actions align with a careful, reverent temperament. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her competence is never tested. Emotional responses are largely implied rather than embodied in specific sensations or conflicted impulses. The final satisfaction feels granted rather than earned through visible cost or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s core contradiction—absolute competence with external clocks versus helplessness with her own time—is clear and drives her choices. Her motivation to decode the pattern and her inherited belief in “mapping time” make her descent and improvisation feel earned. The shift from needing certainty to tolerating imperfection is credible, though her emotional struggle in the underground scene could be slightly more textured. The final acceptance of leaving clocks “slightly imperfect” lands as an earned renunciation with a modest but real cost to her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—redeeming a failure she feels she signed her name to—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her professional identity as a “balanced” alchemist. Her inner conflict between empirical balance and “factually mystical” phenomena surfaces well in her choice to use the coin despite skepticism. The transition from searching for a boy to attempting to redeem his absence reads earned, though her emotional state could be embodied a bit more viscerally at the ritual peak. Overall, she feels particular and flawed, with a credible, costly renunciation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kael’s motivation (to retrieve the child’s laughter and heal souls while avoiding their own pain) is clear, consistent, and seeded early, and the “modestly fearless” trait is shown rather than merely labeled. The backstory of the child’s death and the vial is well integrated and reweights the present stakes. The final shift—accepting that they too are lost and worthy of retrieval—feels earned by what came before. The only limit is that some of the internal conflict is told in exposition rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied (proprioception, the strap as anchor), and her drive to decode “the mathematics of mercy” clearly motivates her choices in the ritual. The shift from wanting a clean formula to accepting mercy as something lived is legible and earned. However, her emotional life leans conceptual rather than messily human, with few truly contradictory impulses on the page. The trauma is more a philosophical instrument than a fully complex wound driving irrational or self-sabotaging behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories and lighthouse keepers—is clear, specific, and consistently drives their choices from investigating the fragment to claiming the role of “new keeper.” Interiority is sensorial and character-particular (grandmother’s voice, salt, the feel of the glass), lending them texture beyond a generic seeker of truth. Internal conflict exists but stays gentle: there’s curiosity vs. reverence, observer vs. participant, yet no moment of truly fraught ambivalence or risk. The final stance shift toward becoming a keeper feels earned, though the emotional cost of that commitment could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlon is sharply sketched through his occupation, habits of perception, and long-running obsession with ceilings; the ghost-witness angle feels lived-in rather than gimmicky. His motivation to decode what the dead want and his final choice to take one barrel read coherent and earned. Internal contradiction is lighter—he rarely feels truly torn, just resigned and curious—which keeps the characterization from the very top band. Still, his worldview and micro-choices (reading dust, climbing, pocketing one object) are specific and revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to fix and transcribe meaning in a world where reality is fluid, and specifically to compress eternity into a moment—is clear and consistently dramatized through her work with the frost and the bottled whisper. Her interiority is conveyed more through actions and obsessions than explicit thought, which suits the mode but keeps her just shy of deeply contradictory, layered conflict. Her key choice (to uncork the whisper and feed it into the press) grows credibly from the setup. The emotional cost at the end—having achieved her goal in a way that is not hers to own—registers, though it could be made slightly more embodied or conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (to contest the curated history and reimagine the civilization) is clear and consistent, and his “defunct revolutionary” / active poet tension is compelling. His interiority is specific—“burnished sorrow,” the weight of the shard, the way he treats mirrors and poems as moral choices. However, some feelings are summarized via recurring labels (“poet’s heart,” “defunct revolutionary spirit stirred”) rather than freshly embodied at peak beats. Voss is functional but thin, with his final nod reading slightly abrupt given the prior entrenchment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The repairman’s motives (atonement through absolute honesty, saving the children’s light) are clear and consistently expressed through his craft-focused choices. His internal conflict—doubt, temptation from the covenant, physical cost when he lapses—is present but could deepen with more moment-to-moment contradiction rather than cleanly resolved resolve. Embodied emotion via rust pain and easing joints works well and ties psychology to the magic system. The veiled woman is more emblematic than person, but that suits the fable-like frame without undercutting his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira is sharply etched through vocation and worldview: a scientist of scent who believes in “sensory detours,” and her actions (collecting vials, preparing for the descent, offering the petrichor) all align with that. The internal contradiction—wanting to follow the vanished expedition yet choosing to stay as “keeper”—is there, though it’s rendered more conceptually than viscerally. Emotion could be embodied a bit more in the peak beats, which lean on abstractions like “understanding” rather than bodily cost. Still, the final renunciation reads as earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, sensibility, and buried motivation are specific and convincing, and her micro-choices (continuing despite GPS failure, carving and placing the token) align with that characterization. However, internal conflict is relatively muted—there’s little felt push-pull between fear, doubt, and the pull of the alliance, so her shift reads more like a smooth realization than a hard-won turn. The “contract with the sea” and “perpetually learning nature” are strong, but they don’t visibly cost her anything on the page. The final acceptance of her role is emotionally credible but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sable’s central desire is clear and consistent, and her choices (undertaking the journey, engaging with the glass, reorienting her art) track with that motive. However, her interior conflict remains muted; we rarely feel competing impulses or genuine doubt, only a steady, almost serene curiosity. The realization at the window (“flowers bloom at night to greet the moon…”) feels a bit unearned because we haven’t seen her wrestle concretely with alternate explanations or costs. Emotional embodiment leans more on atmosphere than on specific, character-particular reactions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation as a civil-rights archivist is clear and consistently drives her choices, especially in the parley where she risks her position to insist on disclosure. The retrocognitive haunting gives her interiority specificity (“sand in her sheets”) and a visible psychic cost. Her shift from adversarial stance to acknowledging nuance in the Under-Minister’s request reads earned, not convenient. The one limitation is that her internal contradiction (duty to truth vs. fear of reigniting violence) is more stated than dramatized in a concrete dilemma scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s motivation is clear—he refuses to resurrect the past and instead wants to reimagine a civilization—and his actions (lantern-making, city-planning, incantation) align with that. However, his interiority leans conceptual rather than embodied, with little sense of physical stress, doubt, or contradiction under pressure. The rejection of “false comfort” is stated but not much dramatized as an active internal conflict. The final “smiled, knowing that…” line veers toward tidy insight rather than a felt, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and inner life are specific and convincing, and his accidental prophecy produces a credible shift from professional detachment to personal burden. The motivation to “archive emotional patterns” is distinctive but stays a bit abstract, with limited dramatized internal conflict beyond solemn unease. His choices—playing the shaving, echoing the language, immersing, then archiving—track cleanly with his role and temperament. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper, on-page clash of impulses where he seriously considers not preserving or actively destroying the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role and core motivation (reopen the passage, preserve seeds/time) are clear and consistent, and her actions align with them. However, internal conflict is minimal—she rarely hesitates or wrestles with contradictory impulses, and the vortex choice scene resolves without visible struggle. Emotional texture leans on repeated abstractions (“wild serenity,” “furious tranquility”) rather than embodied, character-specific reactions. The ending shift (understanding borrowed time) feels more like a conceptual notch than a hard-won, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives—duty to warn, distrust of mechanical noise, and disciplined curiosity—are clear and consistently drive her choices, especially in the hesitation at the switch and the final refusal to ring the bell. Internal conflict between protocol and listening is active in-scene rather than summarized. Her professional habits (meticulous logs, attention to microclimates) individualize her beyond archetype. The endurance choice at the end (to do nothing loudly) feels earned, though the emotional cost could be shaded with a bit more vulnerability or risk to her standing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sola is specific and coherent—the “cosmic janitor” with a broom of stardust and patched uniform feels vivid, and her shift from armored loneliness to devotional caretaking is legible. Her spiritual curiosity and empathy motivate her actions, especially preserving the glass and tending the moss. However, internal conflict is light: we’re told her heart “began to soften” rather than seeing contradictory impulses play out in scene. The change is credible but somewhat smoothed and idealized, with little visible cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motive—preserving unspoken words—is clear and consistent, and her final resolve to restore the hives grows plausibly from it. However, her interiority relies heavily on repeated abstractions (“weight of unspoken words”) rather than concrete, character-specific feelings or contradictions. We rarely see her wrestle with competing impulses (e.g., solitude vs. obligation) in the moment. The relationship with the ghost is evocative but emotionally underdeveloped, mostly summarized as a “tangled covenant” rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s blend of fatalism (expecting to die at twenty) and almost workmanlike curiosity about damaged capsules gives her a specific, credible psychology, and her choice to reach out via garage-sale listings is a characterful tactic rather than a generic plot move. Her internal shift from seeing her life as “borrowed” debt to “a gift to be spent outside the ledger” is earned by what she experiences. The secondary figure formed from dust is more vessel for exposition than a fully pressured character, so the relationship under pressure is sketched rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s motivation—to find beauty in the incomplete—is clear and consistent, and his small choices (writing, keeping the feather, leaving it, then tucking it away again) track with that aim. However, his emotional life is largely serene and reflective; there is little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. Realizations like “beauty often resides in what is left unfinished” are articulated rather than dramatized as hard-won. The final understanding of his role (“not to finish the poem”) feels thematically apt but comes with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation (deadline-turned-legacy) is precise and drives every choice, and his calm, craftsmanlike response to terminal news feels particular rather than generic stoicism. The embodied details—weakening hands, fever, bioluminescent moss lighting his paths—give his emotions texture without melodrama. Internal conflict is subtler than it might be; we infer his fear and attachment more than we see them actively contradict his composure. The final endurance into translation is well-earned but could carry even more ambivalence to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—her exile and skepticism drive each beat—but she rarely faces real pressure that forces difficult trade-offs. Interiority is specific (“academically rebellious,” “quiet forge of bronze resolve”) yet largely unconflicted, with little sense of competing impulses in the moment. Her final shift—from rebel to “seeker”—is earned conceptually but feels more like a reframing than a costly change. The lack of on-page opposition keeps her psychology from deepening into something messier or riskier.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coachman’s motive—to reclaim the battlefield through seeds, song, and concord—is clear and consistent, and his history is powerfully implied through images (“eyes held the dust of a thousand battles”). However, we get almost no direct interior conflict or contradictory impulses; he never doubts, falters, or pays a visible personal price beyond effort and memory. His choices are active and coherent but emotionally one-note, which flattens potential complexity at the climax. The endurance/renunciation component at the end is more conceptual than felt in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Wick’s characterization is vivid and particular—a retired corpse-finder with an overdeveloped scent memory, pulled back into a quest by the faint chance of connection and the trace of his old handler. His motives (avoidance of death-work vs. longing for Maya) are clear and consistent, and his actions—playing the cylinder, deciding to cross the wasteland, choosing to stay with the archive—track cleanly from those motives. Internal contradiction (weariness vs. compulsion toward connection) is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized in scene. Secondary characters are minimal and mostly functional, which keeps focus tight but reduces relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s motives (loneliness, inherited ritual, pull toward the anomalous light) are clear and consistent, and the decision to leave the station is psychologically legible. However, internal conflict is underplayed: there’s little sense of fear, doubt, or competing impulses about stepping into the void. Emotion skews abstract and conceptual (“blessed pariah,” “true north of the heart”) rather than concretely embodied. As a result, the final choice feels meaningful but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kaelen’s goal and loyalties are clear, and his “apprentice of wonder” worldview gives him a distinct, gentle flavor, but we rarely see true internal conflict or contradictory impulses under pressure. His fear “dissolves” almost instantly when the heart calls, so the turn costs him little on the page. The relationship with the absent master is sketched but never forces a hard choice or doubt in the present scene. Overall he’s likable and consistent, but emotionally undercomplicated for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to unbind the prisoner and preserve the memory of the “pawns”—is clear and consistent, and his final choice to remain as a historian of small gestures is legible and earned. However, his inner life is more archetypal than particular; we rarely see concrete, embodied emotion or contradictory impulses under pressure. The “crisis actor” detail is intriguing but not dramatized in ways that shape how he moves through this mission. As a result, he feels like a thematic vessel more than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira’s motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) is clear and carried through to the end, and her hesitation before pressing the final glyph gives her at least one credible moment of internal conflict. However, her interiority stays somewhat archetypal—“remembering became painful,” “old wounds”—without much character-specific texture or contradiction beyond that single dilemma. Her change at the end (reframing thunder and memory) feels earned but emotionally understated, with limited sense of concrete cost. Strong but not yet at the depth and idiosyncrasy expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s guilt, exile, and professional habits create a coherent psychology, and his shift—from avoiding harm to choosing to teach again—feels causally earned. His motivation is clear and consistent, especially in the beats around the girl’s request. However, his interiority leans on generalized language about guilt and resolve rather than more idiosyncratic, character-specific perceptions. The girl functions more as symbol than fully pressured presence, so the relationship dynamic is underexploited.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s defiant, art-driven motive is clear and consistent, and his choice to vandalize the spire is credibly rooted in his prior weeks of subversive poetry. However, his interior conflict is relatively thin—he rarely wavers or doubts—so the emotional cost of his rebellion lands more conceptually than viscerally. Mara functions well as a foil awakened by his influence but remains mostly thematic rather than fully individuated. The relationship dynamic adds texture but doesn’t quite become a crucible forcing a painful, personal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to repair and reclaim memory under lethal pressure—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her micro-choices as the exchanger fails. Her interiority is vivid and particular (“uncertainty was her discipline”), and her physical fear registers through concrete embodiment (trembling hands, burning lungs) rather than labels. The arc from “uncertain alchemist” to wearing uncertainty “as armor, gilded and glorious” reads as an earned reconfiguration, not a flip. Internal contradiction (terror vs. devotion to meaning) is present, though it could sharpen further in one or two peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s longing and private vow are clear and consistent, and his final release from the past feels earned. However, his interiority stays relatively generalized and serene; we rarely see sharp, contradictory impulses under pressure, only a steady, elegiac determination. The “intimately aloof” quality is named but not dramatized in specific, conflicted behaviors. This keeps the characterization solid but a step below fully vivid and idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s inner life is specific and embodied—her relationship to the cork and to Marcus’s shouting gives her a clear, character-particular motive, and her final act grows credibly from eleven months of silent adaptation. Marcus’s shift from hammering commands to trembling, wordless contact is grounded in his fear of silence, so the closing request to “teach me how to listen” feels earned rather than abrupt. The contradiction between Elara’s screaming tenderness and her outward composure is well staged, though her own internal ambivalence under risk could be teased a hair more in-scene. The relationship does alter state with visible emotional cost for Marcus, and a quiet but legible victory for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—grief and the drive to bring his sister (and others) back—is clear and consistent, and his work on the resonator is a concrete, character-driven response to that need. Interiority is present in lines like “Tears carved rivers down his dust-streaked face,” but his emotional life is largely single-note yearning and determination, with little on-page contradiction or moral friction. The final shift from void to “fragile peace” feels earned but relatively straightforward. There’s room for sharper moments where his longing, doubt, and potential refusal genuinely collide.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motives (protecting the village while bound to involuntary truth) are clear and consistent, and her rational, procedural mindset feels specific. The internal conflict between scientific control and uncontrollable honesty is well-drawn, especially around the burial and later unveiling of the eye. Emotional life is present but somewhat abstracted—few concrete, bodily reactions undercut the otherwise rich interiority. Villagers remain a collective blur, so relational pressure is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

    Cornelius is specific and memorable—his eccentric solitude, ritual pacing, and reverent handling of the boutonniere all feel character-true. His motivation to understand and to witness is clear and consistent, and his final acceptance of the role of keeper/witness is credibly built. Internal contradiction is present only faintly (he’s lonely yet committed to isolation), so his arc reads more as deepening than as a pressured change. The emotional texture is rich but largely unconflicted, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Merrick reads as a specific, lived-in person—lonely, obsessive, and quietly guilt-ridden—and his profession and habits are well-integrated into his worldview. His motivation to honor Clara’s promise and confront his own stasis is clear and consistent. The main weakness is that his final decision to step through the doorway comes with little on-page hesitation or contradictory impulse in the climax, which slightly undercuts the sense of struggle. A brief beat of more embodied ambivalence at the threshold would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The queen’s disenchantment and longing for meaning are clearly motivated and carried through to the final renunciation. Her choice to surrender throne, life, and name is legible and paid for, and the closing shift from “bitter resignation” to “quiet devotion” reads earned. However, the internal conflict at the exact moment of choice is relatively smooth; we don’t see much real flinch or counter-impulse before she accepts her fate. A bit more in-the-moment resistance could deepen her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear—the alchemist wants to “capture the density of presence”—and her choices (mixing pigments with the shell, sealing the vial) align with that aim. However, her interiority leans abstract and declarative, with little embodied contradiction or genuine doubt; “certainty” and “resolve” are named more than dramatized. Kael’s “scientifically romantic” stance is stated but not really tested or strained. The relationship is gentle and supportive, so the story never really uses it as a crucible to force costly or ambiguous choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The chronicler’s motivation—to distill chaos into narrative—even as his own identity/time erodes is clear, specific, and drives every choice (writing, soaring, accepting becoming “a narrative”). Contradictory impulses are well-handled: jealousy vs wonder, fear of disintegration vs compulsion to record, self-loathing vs pride in pattern-recognition. Emotional states are mostly embodied through concrete surreal images (moss-slick granite, scroll drinking ink, cabin breathing), though occasionally edged toward abstract summarizing (“my motivation remained stubborn”). The final renunciation/acceptance (descending “not as a man but as a narrative”) feels earned by the prior interior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and embodied—her anosmia, tactile focus, and mistrust of other senses all feel psychologically grounded—and her final shift from control to translation is credibly earned. Marcus reads as a distinct presence with a clear worldview that presses on her assumptions without bullying the scene. The relationship is understated but effective as a crucible for change. The only limitation is that the emotional conflict resolves a bit cleanly for such a complex loss, skimming some messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelin’s motivation—to transmute scars into stories—is clear, specific, and consistently tied to concrete actions (the sigil, the ink, the crow quill). Her anxiety embodied through the crystallizing ink is strong, but her internal conflict stays relatively linear: there’s little real doubt or competing impulse beyond fear versus resolve. The shift from scholar to storyteller is thematically apt yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. I missed one genuinely difficult, value-charged moment where continuation of the ritual feels at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira and Linden are sharply etched for the length: her hybrid identity (gossip columnist / exorcist) and his wounded reserve play cleanly off each other. Motivation is clear and specific—her overdue apology intersects credibly with his loyalty to his grandmother. The emotional turn when the scent unlocks his guardedness (“Linden's shoulders softened…”) feels earned rather than mechanical. The only limitation is that their contradictory impulses under peak pressure remain relatively contained and polite, never quite pushed to a messier edge.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The witness’s motivation—to unify scattered truths and unravel cosmic illusions—is clear and consistent, and her final surrender to the pattern she “already is” feels earned. However, her interiority stays largely at an abstract, cosmic register, so contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire, attachment vs. surrender) are implied rather than concretely dramatized. Embodied emotion appears in touches like the dictionary’s weight and warmth, but the piece favors concept over felt, messy interior conflict. The change from desiring control to accepting identity-as-pattern lands, but with a certain emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias has a clear, coherent motivation and a distinct quirkiness (talking to gears, treating time as something to be anatomized), but his interiority is largely conceptual rather than embodied. We rarely see contradictory impulses or concrete emotional textures; his “quest” remains serene, even at peak moments. The final understanding feels earned by prior actions but carries little on-page emotional cost. Strongly sketched for a lyric piece, but not yet at elite-level psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael is sharply sketched through professional competence, pattern-obsessed perception, and a believable pivot from suspicion to protection. The core decision—to deactivate alarms and cross the membranes—tracks cleanly with their curiosity and accumulated unease. However, the internal conflict remains somewhat conceptualized rather than fully embodied; we’re told the realization more than we feel the competing impulses in the moment. The old woman is vivid but largely emblematic, which slightly limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s grief, intellectual rigor, and inherited gambler’s legacy are clearly and consistently motivated, and her small but real shift toward reconciliation at the end is earned. However, her internal conflict (logic vs luck, anger vs tenderness toward her father) stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices. The “thrill of a theoretically rebellious act” is a nice spike of specificity that reveals character. The ending promise feels slightly too unopposed and tidy for her level of trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is coherent and her choices—staying on the line, investigating the disc, finally shattering it and leaving—track credibly with her shift from cultivated isolation to connection. Her estrangement is well-seeded (“like a gardener tending a thorny hedge”) and paid off when it becomes “a bridge she could cross.” Internal conflict between her desire to remain detached and her growing investment in the callers is present but could be dramatized more sharply in scene rather than mostly via summary. The culminating transformation feels earned, though the line “Mira's motivation surfaced: to teach endings how to begin” states rather than shows her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s motivation—preserving memory and regenerating a broken covenant—is clear, consistent, and drives her choices (going to the jetty, writing, leaving jasmine). Interiority is reasonably specific, grounded in tactile actions with ink, paper, and objects. However, she rarely exhibits contradictory impulses or genuine resistance; the arc moves smoothly from recognition to resolve without much internal friction. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira is vividly sketched (the satchel, the laughter, the rumor-barter), but she remains more emblematic than psychologically legible, with little interior contradiction under pressure. Her key decision—to weaponize the moon rock as hope—is told rather than felt through embodied hesitation or cost. Secondary figures (Gus, Elara, the ghosts) serve thematic roles cleanly but never gain enough specificity to become relational crucibles. The closing departure of Mira has emotional potential but reads as assumed archetype (the wandering helper) rather than an earned, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motives and interiority are clear and particular—her tactility, blindness, and grief-linked mapmaking feel embodied rather than generic. The link between her mother’s request, the ring, and her need to locate grief is well motivated. However, the emotional journey is relatively unconflicted; she wants something and steadily gets it, with little sense of competing impulses in the moment. Lines like “Her motivation had been simple” flatten some of the nuance the earlier paragraphs earn.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and consistent—his “confidently uncertain” stance, regret, and search for meaning all cohere—but his key decisions (which moments to edit, what he sacrifices) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat. We’re told he must choose what to preserve, yet we rarely feel the live tension of those specific choices on the page. The emotional shift to fragile peace is credible, but the cost remains somewhat abstract. More embodied micro-choices under pressure would sharpen his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interior life and motive—waiting as a ghost of eroded memory rather than a specific tragedy—are distinctive and consistent, and his shift from passively rehearsing disappearance to actively “mapping silence” feels earned. His realization that he was waiting “for permission to remember himself” is well prepared by his long stasis and the advisor’s intervention. Internal contradiction is present but understated; we don’t see much simultaneous push–pull (reluctance vs desire) in on-page micro-choices. The advisor is effectively enigmatic, though more a function than a fully fleshed person.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s guilt, past complicity, and shift from arsonist to librarian are sharply etched, with embodied, idiosyncratic emotion (“volcanic tenderness erupted in Kael’s chest”). The core motivation—atoning by rebuilding what they destroyed—is clear and consistent, and small choices (following intuition, mining pigments by hand) track with that. Internal contradiction is present but more implied than dramatized in on-page moments of indecision, and relationships are mostly off-stage (Cress as memory rather than active crucible). The final stance feels earned, though some evolution (e.g., their first choice to create instead of burn) is summarized rather than scene-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—to rescue/transform Mira and escape the facility’s constraints—is clear, specific, and consistently drives his tactics from the stolen magnet to the bleeding hands at the lagoon. His interiority is textured (fragments of Mira’s memories vs his own desire), though true internal contradiction under peak pressure is only lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized. The relationship with Mira, while one-sided on the page, feels real through concrete shards (strawberries, music, invented language) that shape his actions. The final renunciation of his body in favor of becoming “the garden itself” is earned and carries a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marek’s competence, history with the maps, and relationship to the labyrinth read specific and consistent, and his choice to weaponize maintenance knowledge under pressure feels motivated. However, interior conflict is limited—he never wavers on the bet or reveals a competing impulse, so we lose some depth. Emotional life is gestured at more than embodied; his breathless arrival is the closest we get to felt cost. The smuggler is more a function than a character, with no real pressure exerted beyond the initial bet.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The guardian and child are emotionally legible but archetypal; we understand his desire to soothe and teach, and the child’s fear/insomnia, yet neither accrues much contradiction or complexity. His “silent empathy” remains a label rather than dramatized interior struggle, and we never see him torn between competing impulses. The child’s shift from fear to calm is clear but frictionless, with little sense of what it costs to trust. This keeps the piece touching but below publish-ready depth for a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    Hartwin’s motivation—to seed “forests of second thoughts”—is clear and consistently dramatized through his teaching, puzzles, and restraint from overt revolt. However, he experiences little visible internal conflict or doubt; his choices come too smoothly, with minimal felt cost or contradiction. Secondary characters (students, townspeople, authorities) are more symbolic than individuated, so relational pressure is low. The closing sense of victory is thus conceptually satisfying but emotionally under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s duty-versus-dance conflict is clear and particular, and her choices (detaching the rope, offering her palm to the guardian, ultimately embracing the island’s freedom) track cleanly with that inner tension. Embodiment—calloused feet, crate-lifting, dancerly movements—roots her in a lived body. However, the internal struggle remains relatively smooth and lightly contested; we’re mostly told her heart is a “fortress of duty” rather than feeling that resistance actively destabilize her in the confrontation and at the return to the mainland.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The performer’s interiority—grief, secret rebellion, and complicity as an informant—is clear and morally complex, and the contrast between the mask and inner life is effective. However, much of this is told rather than dramatized in concrete decisions under pressure (e.g., the decision to inform on the dog is summarized as a morning inevitability instead of a scene). The internal conflict between survival and betrayal is interesting but rarely forces an in-the-moment choice. The final understanding about the “remade hush” feels earned but emotionally muted by the largely static behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The poet’s motivation (aesthetic hunger and boundary-crossing after a ban) is clear and consistent, and her choices—entering the atrium, touching the quartz, walking onto the lake—track with that. However, her emotional life stays largely in the register of abstract awe; we get little concrete, character-particular contradiction or embodied fear. The years of silence and the ban are mentioned but not really dramatized as a lived wound on the page. As a result, her final stance feels intriguing but not deeply costly or internally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara has a clear, specific motive (beauty in imperfection, seeking the perfect note) and a distinctive sensory constraint, and Dorian’s guarded artistry is legible enough to make their exchange plausible. However, “innocently cunning” remains mostly a label rather than dramatized conflict, and neither character faces a truly difficult or self-compromising choice. Emotional costs are gentle and tidy, with little contradictory feeling under pressure. The final “mutual awakening” feels more like a graceful completion than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation is vivid and specific—her belief in sound as physical memory and her attachment to the lens ground her choices and keep them consistent. Her power dynamic with Mara is clear and her “powerfully gentle” refusal to abandon imperfection feels earned. What’s missing is stronger on-page contradiction or cost in her interiority; she never seriously wavers or risks much beyond professional skepticism. Mara works mostly as a foil rather than a fully pressured partner in change.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—transmuting her own grief and professional guilt into a project of teaching a dead star (and then others) to “bloom” again. Her interiority is textured with shame, numbness, and cautious renewed purpose, though the piece leans more on conceptual framing than on fully embodied, moment-to-moment emotion. The realization that Mnemosyne is a mirror of her own grief is well grounded in prior beats and feels earned. The main limitation is that the internal conflict is mostly narrated rather than dramatized in present-tense micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is specific and compelling—a systems-obsessed cartomancer whose methods and worldview feel coherent, and whose line “I’m reverse engineering what comes next” is clearly earned by prior behavior. Her motivation (mapping cultural patterns rather than personal fortunes) is dramatized through the measuring, card spreads, and refusal of easy comfort. The architect is more emblematic than individuated, though his trembling, loose suit, and “hunger of a convert” give him just enough life for this length. Internal contradiction in Mara is minimal—she’s almost too self-possessed—so the emotional cost of her stance remains mostly conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s core motivation (personal loss, hunger for forbidden knowledge) is clear and consistent, and her “anguished joy” in touching the pagoda reads as a believable mixed state. However, the loss itself is abstract (“personal loss that marked the end of her innocence”) and never particularized, which blunts the emotional stakes. Her internal conflict is mostly narrated rather than dramatized through concrete, character-specific reactions. The closing choice to withdraw from the pagoda and carry the burden is earned but could carry more bite with sharper, more individuated interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The noticer’s motivation—to preserve the library’s hope—is clear and consistent, and her quiet vigilance plus the stone’s emotional weight give her interiority. However, we mostly get a smooth, declarative throughline of duty rather than in-scene contradictory impulses or messy ambivalence. Her final cost (“a piece of oneself”) is thematically strong but somewhat summarized instead of dramatized in embodied detail. Still, the arc from observer to sacrificer is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and conflicted: shame, duty, self-recrimination, and love for the animals all pull on her simultaneously and concretely shape each small choice (burning brochures, calling the officer, tending Veridian first). The self-respect vs. compassion tension is not abstract but dramatized in micro-actions and bodily detail (trembling hands, the feel of the chameleon’s pulse). Her late resolve—to report the fraud yet fight to keep the animals—feels fully earned by what precedes it, with a clear cost. The only thing that holds this short of the very top band is that her past complicity and self-deception, while invoked, could be surfaced in even more scene-level friction rather than largely in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s desire for “closure” and to read the stories in scars is clear and consistent, and her choice to enter the tunnel tracks with that drive. However, her interiority stays abstract and mostly affirmational; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine hesitation. Emotional embodiment is light (little fear, pain, or doubt in the tunnel sequence), which flattens what could be a charged self-reckoning. The final shift toward accepting scars as “verses in a poem of survival” feels earned enough but comes without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s motivation (to locate and rescue unused love before demolition) is clear, consistent, and builds naturally into the final acceptance of carrying the Rialto’s archive. Interiority is specific (“her spatially imaginative mind mapping each wire as constellation memory”) and embodied, though her internal conflict around becoming this vessel and around Elena’s memory could be dramatized more directly instead of mostly implied. The moment she recognizes her own unused love in the booth is a strong, character-particular turn that earns the eventual burden she takes on. The arc is an earned endurance/renunciation, but a touch more friction or hesitation at the cost would deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist’s desire to unblock her creativity is clear and consistent, and her decision to undertake a difficult journey is motivated. However, she remains more archetype than person; we learn almost nothing concrete about her life, body, or history beyond the grandmother/sextant mention. Internal conflict is thin—she’s blocked, then she journeys, then she rests—without much dramatized ambivalence or self-sabotage. The final change (block lifted) is earned enough, but its cost feels abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guard’s motivation—to preserve and re-root possibility—is clear and consistent, and their final self-sacrificial act feels earned. However, interiority remains largely conceptual, with little concrete, embodied emotion to individuate them beyond role and function. We get almost no contradictory impulses in-scene (no hesitation before sacrificing self, no selfish pull against duty), which limits psychological depth. The “dreamless” trait is thematically reweighted at the end but not much dramatized as a lived tension earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The philosopher’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her realizations track coherently from image to image (“not a prison but a question,” then architect/map-and-territory). However, she remains more archetypal than individuated, with limited contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. Most choices are reflective stances rather than difficult, value-testing decisions, which softens the sense of cost. The final shift feels earned conceptually but not deeply fought-for on an emotional level.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lin’s motivation (find the dog, move through fear) is clear and consistent, and the quiet-courage arc is legible, but interiority remains fairly generalized (“feeling the weight of a silence”) rather than deeply particular. The ferry guides are effective archetypes yet never quite individuate beyond “wise and kind.” The final internal shift toward courage is earned by accumulated experience, but it reads closer to a smooth affirmation than a conflicted, costly choice. There’s little evidence of genuine contradiction or moral friction under pressure, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt, physical recovery, and role in the fortress create a coherent, specific interior life, with her past cowardice and current vigilance in clear tension. The spinal injury, nerve regeneration, and her status as former bellhop all factor into how she reads and responds to the new warning stain. Her final choice to report and remain is well-earned by prior beats, though her emotions around Milo and the choir could be rendered with a bit more raw, contradictory texture. Overall, her motives and micro-choices under pressure feel credible and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivations are clear—Sylvar as patient guardian, Vael as hollow usurper—but interiority is thin and largely summarized, with almost no contradictory impulses under pressure. Sylvar never feels tested; he executes a plan that works exactly as intended, so we don’t see values in conflict or costed choices. Vael’s fear and ambition are implied but not embodied beyond surface reactions. The final “regally unpretentious” smile gestures at complexity without having earned it through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lina is coherent and specific—a climate grief–marked technician whose habits (tapping, archiving) feel lived-in—but she remains largely single-valence: meditative, sorrowful, dutiful. Her primary “choice” is to investigate the atlas scrap and then to accept a witness role; this is credible yet low-friction. Internal contradiction (wanting answers vs. knowing answers won’t save the corals) is implied more than dramatized in scene. The closing acceptance of her role as witness feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kai’s interiority is specific and grounded—her blend of loss, curiosity, and quasi-mystical pattern-seeking is well-drawn, and her barefoot, tactile relationship to the environment feels character-particular. Her motivation (“meaning in the mess,” resistance to the rebels’ tactical mindset) is clear and drives her choices toward the stone circle and singing. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively mild; she moves from uncertainty to certainty without much visible cost or real struggle on the page. The final stance shift is credible and earned, but emotionally smooth rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is vivid and specific—an aging rebel hidden in the role of grandmother, with clear motive rooted in grief and disillusionment. Her long, covert rebellion and the teaching of her grandchildren give her believable continuity. However, the story rarely dramatizes true internal contradiction at the decision point; she doesn’t seriously waver between obedience and defiance on the page. The social cost (being called traitor/prophet) is mostly summarized rather than felt through her interiority in the climactic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, pattern-finding mind, and body-based memory are rendered with concrete, character-specific detail (“his fingers remembered his wife's hand”). His motivation—to find a way to live with trauma without erasing it—consistently drives choices, and the final stance (“freeze the moment before without denying the moment after”) feels earned. The internal conflict between wanting escape and insisting on realism is present, though at times stated a bit too explicitly. The curator is more symbolic than pressuring, but that suits the piece’s quiet, single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent: the blocked portraitist whose “ache in her chest was luminescent” feels psychologically coherent, and her choice to engage with the threads grows credibly from that state. Her conflict between disbelief in fate and the need to “redesign” it is well staged. The main limitation is that most of her struggle is interior and metaphorical; we get relatively few concrete, behavior-level contradictions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motive—understanding time’s slowness in crisis rooted in his mentor’s loss—is clear and consistent, and his “conscious wildness” versus restraint gives him a credible contradiction. However, much of his emotion is summarized via recurring labels (“serene anger,” “conscious wildness”) rather than being freshly embodied under pressure. The key micro-choice—leashing his instinct to “tear through the veil” and instead focusing on the ink—is solid but could carry more specific, felt cost. His final stance (to keep experimenting tomorrow) reads as an earned endurance, but the psychological price of that obsession is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, rooted in long service and habituated obedience colliding with a sudden, specific moral test, and the story lets her contradiction (“loyalty to her oath” vs “loyalty to truth”) act simultaneously rather than in tidy sequence. Her micro-choices—studying the tubes, reactivating the system, accepting that curators will come—track cleanly with that internal split and make the final act feel earned. Emotions are embodied through tactile cold, breath, and the tremor in her hands rather than label-only interiority. The one limit is that her personal history and flaws beyond the job are only lightly sketched, so she stops just short of feeling fully three-dimensional at a literary-mag level.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra is sharply etched as a pacifist in a violent lineage, with concrete rituals (singing to roses, using the disc, sheathing the knife) that reveal character. Her motives are consistent and legible—maintaining a sanctuary of peace—yet she faces very little real internal contradiction or hard cost on the page. The encounter with the stranger gestures toward moral risk but resolves without testing her values. The ending’s endurance of her stance feels earned but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avery’s motivation (devoting her life to catching Echo’s remnant) is clear and consistently expressed through specific ritual choices, and the final renunciation is well earned. The internal contradiction—cool-headed technique vs. “hidden grief” and longing—is present but could surface more viscerally in body and thought under peak pressure. Her decision to release Echo reads psychologically coherent, though relatively unstruggled on the page. A touch more embodied hesitation or temptation at the climax would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Victoria’s interiority is vivid and specific—her relationship to the rosewood nib, the orbits of regret, and her father’s legacy all read as grounded and psychologically credible. Her core contradiction (loyalty to the paper vs. need for moral truth) is active on the page and culminates in a motivated choice. The emotional beat of signing with the nib “so deeply it left indentations on the desk beneath” nicely externalizes her decision. What keeps this short of the very top tier is that we never see her make a truly costly *personal* sacrifice yet; the cost remains mostly projected.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—atoning for the harm she’s done to marked children—is clear, consistent, and drives every action, and her profession as constellation tattooist particularizes her well. However, her interiority trends toward role and function (“keeper,” “translator”) rather than fully embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure. We see guilt and grim resolve but very little live hesitation or self-sabotage in the ritual itself, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. The realization that she wrote the letters is strong but arrives more as concept than as a deeply felt self-reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The artist’s motivation—to “discover meaning in the mess of collective forgetting”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially in deciding to follow the tile’s dangerous instruction. Interiority is sensory and character-particular (“fingers, socially perceptive as any diplomat’s, read the silence like braille”), rather than generic. Internal conflict (the need for the village to remember trauma vs. the risk of feeding a ravenous grotto) is present but largely conceptual and could be embodied more sharply in moment-to-moment hesitation. The final act—breaking the seventh turn—feels earned, though the emotional cost is sketched more than fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Arin’s core drive—to hold on to empathy in a brutalized world—is clear and consistent, and his choice to rename the plaza flows credibly from this. However, his internal conflict is mostly asserted rather than dramatized; we’re told about “warm coldness” and “frost and flame” but see few concrete moments where contradictory impulses truly collide on the page. The retrocognitive burden is described but barely tests his resolve in real time. As a result, the final stance feels right but a bit under-earned for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost’s motivation (hunger for an encore redirected into helping the young actress) is clear and consistent, and his tactics (maze, orchard, coin) align with that drive. However, his interior conflict is thin: he never truly wrestles with resentment, fear of fading, or the cost of letting go of his own encore. The actress is more a symbolic recipient than a character with embodied, specific doubts. The final “purpose fulfilled” beat lands, but with relatively little felt sacrifice or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lina’s blend of affectionate skepticism and tentative belief in her grandmother’s geode is clear and consistent, and her motivation to extract something useful from the recall is well grounded. Interiority is specific—tingling nerves, the thumb-mark, the way she softens into “tender curiosity.” However, there’s little genuine internal contradiction under pressure; doubt never seriously threatens her decision to proceed, and no real cost is dramatized for her choice. The closing shift to fragile optimism feels earned but relatively low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s vocation and core desire (“to become the voice of the unknown”) are clear and consistent, and her actions align with that drive. However, her interiority stays fairly abstract—she feels “grief” and “longing” more as concepts than as embodied, contradictory impulses. There’s little sense of real internal conflict or limitation pushing back against her chosen role. Her final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost and emotionally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The turner’s dedication, solitude, and gradual shift from archivist to would-be liberator of time are clear and consistent, with specific vocational detail grounding her. However, her interiority remains largely archetypal—“duty” evolving into “shared wisdom”—rather than sharply individuated, and we rarely see simultaneous contradictory impulses on the page. The decades-spanning commitment and the final re-visioning of her role do create a credible, earned change. The main lack is a felt, moment-to-moment struggle or moral friction as she crosses from obedience (forbidden to open) into repurposing the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s motives and internal contradictions (guilt over betrayal vs. desire for return and Elena’s safety) are sharply rendered and consistently drive his choices. His emotional life is embodied (the pillbox habit, the knot in his chest) rather than labeled. The evolution from “reckless operative” to “prudently daring” is dramatized through micro-choices (coming back, handing over everything) rather than simply asserted. The courier is thin but functional as a pressure source, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas is vividly particular—his tactile relationship to reins, gutters, and the yarn needle grounds him as more than an archetypal ferryman, and his long endurance gives the final union weight. His motivation (to keep a complicated promise alive) is clear and consistent, and his actions at the end feel earned. However, his internal conflict is muted; we rarely feel him torn between staying and leaving, or between hope and resignation, which slightly flattens the emotional volatility of such a long wait. The woman, while resonant as an image and counterpoint, remains thinly characterized beyond role and backstory fact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kai’s motivation is clear from the outset and coherently drives her choices: she investigates, listens to the place, makes an offering, and leaves changed. Her interiority feels particular (potter metaphors as worldview), and the “thrum” running through her body is a strong embodied emotional throughline. However, there’s limited on-page contradiction or genuine internal struggle; she mostly aligns smoothly with the story’s philosophy. The final shift is persuasive but more contemplative than hard-won under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation—translating grief and legacy into an act of urban cultivation—is clear, consistent, and concretely enacted. Her attachment to the bitting gauge and the rosebush feels particular and embodied (“measured possibility in millimeters,” “precision was love”). Internal tension (clinging to the fire escape vs. expanding into “horizontal hope”) is present but smoothed rather than dramatized as a real struggle, which slightly softens impact. The final renunciation—outgrowing the fire escape—reads earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to transform crushing isolation into a different kind of independence—is clear and consistently dramatized through her curiosity (touching the sundial), persistence with the hums, and decision to become a “bridge.” The interiority is concrete at times (“Isolation presses against her like the cold glass of a specimen case”) and her fear of fracturing identity when inhabiting a mammoth adds needed contradiction. However, her culminating realization comes in fairly declarative, thesis-like language, softening the sense of messy, costly ambiguity an elite venue would want at the peak turn. The arc is credible and earned but not yet as knotted or surprising as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s role as a love-letter ghostwriter and keeper of secrets gives her a distinct, specific psychology, and her restlessness after the storm motivates the arc cleanly. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; contradictory impulses (safety in secrecy vs. urge to reveal herself) are stated more than dramatized under pressure. Emotional beats lean lyric rather than embodied—she “knew she must” and “realized” things without much visceral struggle. The final act of signing her own name is moving but feels largely uncostly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s role, professional competence, and cautious hope are clearly and consistently motivated, and her decision to risk the station to protect the community tracks with what we know of her. However, interior conflict under peak pressure is more implied than dramatized; the risk to her career and safety never quite fractures her composure on the page. The story leans on summary (“spent three sleepless nights”) rather than fully embodying her psychological wear. The final endurance—remaining at WKUZ, still cautiously hopeful—feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (find the key/blueprints) is clear and consistent, and her claustrophobia gives her a concrete internal obstacle. The moment when “the walls began to close in” and she steadies herself with the compass point embodies that conflict effectively, though it resolves quickly and without much messiness. We mostly get a single, heroic throughline rather than richer contradictory impulses or moral ambiguity. Her final conceptual shift toward reimagining the city feels earned but lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and compelling—face blindness as “geometries of grief, ratios of loss” reads as a genuine perceptual signature, not a gimmick. Her methodical armor versus her buried need for empathy creates a credible internal contradiction that pays off when she abandons pure procedure for “desperate” painting. The shift from hollow accuracy to “recognizable as someone” is earned and clearly rooted in prior traits. The cost of renewed empathy (what it will demand of her going forward) is only lightly implied rather than fully felt, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The librarian’s mixture of idealism, fear, and stubbornness is clear and consistent, and her key choices (overriding protocols, confronting the director) feel motivated. The embodied dread (“wet wool in her lungs”) gives her interiority some specificity, though the repeated “spongey dread” label approaches shorthand. Her change at the end—from nervous to crystallized purpose—reads earned by prior beats, with the cost of professional ruin implied. The director is thinly drawn but functions adequately as an institutional foil under this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fiddler’s core desire (“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) is clear and consistent, and his agency (stopping, playing, following the map, opening the box) tracks logically. However, his interiority leans abstract and slogan-like rather than fleshed out with specific history or contradictions; we don’t see genuinely competing impulses under pressure. Emotional reactions are largely atmospheric (awe, trembling, “luminous disbelief”) rather than grounded in concrete, personal stakes. The ending shift to feeling “at home” is pleasant but not strongly earned as a hard-won, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The son’s motivation—to stop Leo repeating their mistake while probing why cycles recur—is clear and consistent, and his inheritance from the highway robber father personalizes that drive. His interiority is specific in places (reading rust spirals as patterns of ruin), though often phrased in abstract terms rather than embodied contradiction. Leo functions more as an emblem of “reckless spark” than a fully realized counterpart, softening the relational crucible. The final shift—accepting that some circles are to be understood, not escaped—feels earned but carries limited on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s vocation, loneliness, and sense of inherited duty are clearly rendered, and her shift from solitary ambition to understanding shared responsibility feels motivated by the inscriptions and the telegram. Her interiority is textured—she trembles, witnesses, and reinterprets what the Guild told her—though the emotional conflict is relatively smooth and under-tested. We get little sense of genuine hesitation about accepting this burden or of competing impulses beyond fatigue vs. duty. The final acceptance is credible but costs her less visibly than the text implies conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The druid’s motivation (freeing the confession / confronting what mirrors hide) is clear and consistent, and his final realization that he cast the curse himself is earned by the setup. However, his interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told he is “guarded,” carries “warlike serenity,” and feels lighter, but we rarely see contradictory impulses in action. Until the revelation, he reads as a competent, controlled archetype more than a fully individuated person. The emotional cost at the end is present but could cut deeper with more specific, embodied conflict leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivations (heal the eclipsed covenant, find the “intersection of dreams”) are clear and consistent, and her root-bound vs visionary tension is well realized through scars, ancestry, and stolen clipping. Her defiance of her grandmother’s warning and willingness to endure pain for answers feel earned. Internal conflict is present but mild; she moves from fear to resolve quite smoothly, with little messy hesitation under peak pressure. The final shift into becoming a “living threshold” is emotionally credible but edges close to a clean epiphany rather than a fraught trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—recovering her sister by any cost—is clear, consistent with “reckless idealist,” and sharpened into a hard trade at the climax. Her contradiction (knowing the price is too high yet paying it) is dramatized rather than explained, especially in the memory-pouring beat. The Keeper is sketched but functions well as a pressure source rather than a person. The final state—patched but threadbare—earns its emotional cost from the choices we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is clear and specific—her history as a roadie, the recent TV failure, and her reliance on “facts” to buffer feeling all cohere into a credible psychology. The central contradiction (nostalgia and shame vs. self-protective detachment) is dramatized in her indecision over the cloth. However, the emotional progression is very smooth and tidy, with little sense of real risk or mess in choosing to keep it, which limits felt cost. Dale functions more as a foil than real pressure, so relationship dynamics never really sharpen her dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and professional specificity are clear and compelling, and her shift from haunted ambition to quieter witness feels earned. However, her emotional life stays largely in the register of articulated insight rather than embodied contradiction—there’s little on-page friction between urgency (city falling) and her almost serene, contemplative mode. The result is a strong but slightly too controlled interiority, with limited sense of strain or error under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradiction between machine-duty and residual humanity is sharply rendered, with the waning crescent explicitly tilting her toward mechanical precision even as the creel awakens human memory. Her choice to alter the smelting protocol (vents only halfway, gradient of heat) is a clear, motivated deviation from regulations that reveals her hierarchy of values. Emotions are mostly embodied and particularized through tactile engagement with tools, water, gears, and the creel, rather than abstract labels. The final stance—accepting herself as “neither fully human nor entirely machine”—feels earned by prior pressure rather than a convenient epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s profession and family history give her a clear, particular lens, and her key choice—to break protocol and honor the buried hopes—is well motivated by the grandmother parallel and her response to the bunker’s “breathing.” Internal contradiction (duty vs reverence, inspector vs witness) is present but lightly sketched; her emotional state under that pressure could be embodied a bit more specifically. The final act feels earned, but the personal cost (career, identity as inspector) is mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s guilt, sensory overload after stopping medication, and river-linked backstory give her a specific, credible psychology, and her micro-choices (entering the bathroom, touching the graffiti, picking up the bellows) track with that. The “truth-seeking river chronicler” identity and her methodical counting add texture rather than feeling like labels only. Internal conflict (craving the “raw solace” of the place vs. being overwhelmed by sound and memory) is present but not pushed to a breaking point. The final shift toward self-forgiveness feels earned, though somewhat smooth and low-friction for the weight of implied trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The veiled dreamer has a clear, consistent motivation—curiosity and “cautious exuberance” about the library—but her inner life remains relatively abstract. We see some embodied emotion (“trembled,” “heart racing”) yet little contradiction or pressure between competing impulses beyond mild hesitation. Her key choices (taking the watch, following the map, opening the book) align with her quest but don’t expose deeper flaws or blind spots. The final readiness to leave feels appropriate but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s core desire (a free library of instrument-stories) versus the empire’s offer is clear and consistent, and her choice to plant the seed reads as an earned renunciation. Interiority is specific—“mulberry ache,” the weight of promises, the pull of the jasmine voices—though the internal conflict is mostly articulated rather than dramatized in embodied beats. The envoy functions more as a pressure symbol than a full character, so status dynamics and interpersonal tension never fully ignite. Still, Lira’s final choice plausibly forecloses a path (funding, safety) with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, method, and values are sharply etched, and her micro-choices (how she positions the chip, how she breathes stillness rather than touching the soul) align with a coherent inner ethic. However, she experiences almost no visible internal contradiction or emotional disarray under pressure, which flattens potential complexity. Her competence is compelling but nearly untroubled, so the cost of her stance remains mostly conceptual. The result is strong, specific characterization that stops short of the deepest, most conflicted register.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is vivid, specific, and consistent: a sixty-year-old caretaker whose history with Aria and the cloud-wanderer clearly shapes her present choices. Her motives (tending the vines, seeking contentment, refusing to force Mrs. Chen’s rebirth) are legible and coherent. The “kindly decisive” aspect emerges in her refusal to coerce the soul and in the scalloped pruning practice. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s more contemplative than actively torn—so the emotional arc is strong rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conscience-for-hire narrator has a clear internal contradiction—selling certainty while cloaked in doubt—and this motivates the visit and the final shift. Interiority is present and specific, but the emotional progression is a bit too smooth; the insight feels more handed to them by the keeper’s aphorism than wrestled for. The keeper herself functions more as an embodied oracle than as a fully individuated character, though her “sincere insincere” smile hints at complexity. The final renunciation—“wear it more loosely”—is credible but carries limited, lightly sketched cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation—to teach “vanishing to appear” and accept the cost of backward aging—is clear and consistent, and her final choice to become the stone reads earned. However, her interior conflict (between self-preservation and the didactic role) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in concrete, contradictory impulses. Emotion is often handled at a conceptual level (“gift,” “sacrifice”) rather than through specific embodied feeling. She’s vivid as an archetype, less so as an individual with idiosyncratic fears or desires.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skimmer’s central drive—to master navigation without moving—feels specific and consistent, and her reverence for history and stillness is well dramatized through her restraint and ritual. Her interiority is more archetypal than psychologically nuanced, but that suits the mythic mode without entirely excusing the lack of visible internal contradiction. The final acceptance of becoming “the canyon’s keeper of pathways” is motivated by the established longing and patience, though the emotional cost of that vocation is only lightly sketched. A bit more friction—doubt, fear, or temptation to break the taboo of movement—would deepen her as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vorrin’s motivation—an underachiever clinging to “the sacred in the simple” in an over-automated world—is clear and consistent, and it credibly drives his final refusal. However, his internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized; once he reaches the keystone, the choice feels almost foregone, with limited sensation of competing impulses in-scene. Emotional texture leans conceptual rather than embodied, with few concrete bodily or sensory reactions to stress. The Earned Stasis ending (refusing to unstrap, accepting dissolution) is thematically apt but could land harder with more on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core drive (finding the color of sound) is clear and consistently expressed through his synesthetic perceptions and choices. His decisions—to descend, to seek the log, to interpret the lantern—align with that motive. However, there is little real internal contradiction or visible emotional cost; the arc is more serene revelation than pressured change. The final acceptance feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to achieve wavelength alignment with “purpose” rather than dissolve—is clear, consistent, and threads through the entire piece, and her doubt/enthusiasm tension is character-specific rather than generic. Her internal experience is strongly embodied in how she engages with coins, static, and amber rather than in label-speak. However, her internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see many concrete, differentiated micro-choices beyond recasting the lots and reinterpreting the static. The final transformation into “the decision itself” feels thematically right but could land with sharper, more personal cost if more of her prior selfhood or attachments were dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper’s motive—bearing and naming others’ fears as recompense for her sacrifice—is clear and consistent, and her emotional history with “the last soul who shared her living surname” roots that motive. Internal contradiction emerges effectively at the end, when she can name every fear but her own. Earlier in the piece, though, she can feel more like an elegant function of the concept than a fully embodied person, with relatively little concrete, character-specific bodily response under pressure. The final choice to carry the atlas and the mirror-void reads as an earned endurance rather than a new decision, which fits but limits the depth of visible change.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s traits—lukewarm magic, brittle devotion, earnest naivety—are clear and consistently expressed, and his micro-choices in tuning and striking the bell feel motivated by those traits. The emotional strain (“threatening to snap like old twine”) gives him some credible internal conflict, though it remains lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized. His shift from brittle faith to “quiet strength” at the end is legible and earned by the preceding patience, but the cost of that shift is more implied than viscerally felt. Overall, he reads as specific and coherent, if not yet at the depth expected for top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nora is clearly sketched—competent, conscientious, “precisely humane,” with a believable link to Oakhaven through family stories—but she encounters little real resistance, so her decisive acts (gathering evidence, resolving to alter the report) cost her almost nothing on the page. Her interiority is concrete in how she notices objects and landscape, yet her emotional life remains somewhat generalized; we don’t see contradictory impulses or serious doubt about exposing the truth. The final resolve feels credible but too easy, more a continuation of who she already is than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s interiority is specific and textured: pressed violets as “paper-thin memorials” to lost pieces of self is an excellent, character-particular detail. Her core contradiction—relentless rationalist and secret sentimentalist—feels organic and drives her central gestures. The final reconfiguration (accepting logic and intuition as dancers rather than enemies) is motivated by prior images and habits. The main limitation is that her fear of failure/dissolution is mostly stated rather than embodied under real pressure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation—protecting the city and preserving trust—is clear and consistent, and the parachute buckle gives him a concrete embodied link to past failure. However, his emotional palette stays narrow (duty, pressure, resolve) with little contradiction or moral ambiguity under stress. We’re told he once hesitated and fell, but the internal conflict between fear and competence is never really dramatized in the present moment. The “watcher’s burden” is more label than lived contradiction, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sensei’s interior arc from post–ego-death numbness to reintegrated feeling is clear, motivated, and paid for with concrete cost (“grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade”). His core contradiction—valuing enlightenment/emptiness yet reaching for the jarred brain—is dramatized rather than merely stated. The clones are more symbolic modes (duty/legacy/technique) than individuated people, which slightly flattens relational pressure. Still, his final synthesis feels credibly earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara’s core motivation (using the seed as inspiration for her escape rooms and “safeguarding a space for innovation”) is clear and consistent, but she faces no genuine opposition or dilemma to reveal deeper contradictions or flaws. Interiority is mostly aspirational and declarative, with little embodied emotion or irrationality under pressure. Her decisions (to plant the seed, design puzzles, post a sign) are coherent but not tested. The result is a pleasant but under-pressured portrait rather than a fully dimensional character.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eleanor’s motivation—to restore her daughter’s laughter—is vivid, specific, and drives every choice, especially the calibrated use of the pull cord so as not to push Sarah into madness. Her interiority feels particular (“mournfully eager,” “spectral heart a bruised fruit”) and her acceptance of fading at the end reads as an earned cost. Sarah is sketched mainly through behavior (dishwashing freeze, plate drop, cracked laughter, phone call), which keeps her from becoming a mere symbol. The mother’s contradictory impulses (urgent need to help vs. restraint so as not to harm) are dramatized cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guardian’s inner life is specific and consistent, with a clear throughline from homesick functionary to “keeper of thresholds” who chooses a new stance toward waiting. Motivation (to guard, to go home, to befriend uncertainty) is dramatized through micro-choices like licking the pendant, interiorizing the garden, and refusing to approach the door. The internal contradiction—longing for home vs. duty to wait—remains active rather than neatly solved, which gives the final acceptance weight. A slight limitation is that the emotional palette stays in one meditative register; we don’t see much fraying or genuine loss of composure under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to break her bloodline’s doomed pattern—is clear and coherently rooted in her mix of stubborn hope and “stoic sensitivity.” Her interiority is specific enough (“pressure behind her eyes while her face remained calm”) and her final renunciation—walking away without looking back—credibly forecloses a path with visible cost. The contradiction between needing hope to persist and needing to abandon hope to escape destiny is well embodied. A few trait labels (“stoically sensitive,” “hopeless alchemist”) are told rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s competence, pragmatism, and stubborn curiosity are well realized, and her profession is convincingly embodied in how she works the equipment. Her motivation (mentor’s charge, last of her kind) is clear and consistent. The internal shift from “amplify the signal” to “become silence and listen” is earned but sketched more as idea than as conflicted emotion, with little push-pull between fear, ego, and surrender. A touch more contradiction or visible cost to discarding her identity as transmitter would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lina’s motivation (merge the timelines, guide the ferry) is clear and consistent, and we get some embodied emotion (hands on the rail, heart syncing with the engines). However, she faces almost no real internal contradiction or visible cost; her “resilient positivity” is asserted more than tested. The relationship with Captain Roedskal is underused as a crucible—he’s mostly a nodding witness. The ending offers endurance but not a deeply earned renunciation or change in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation and methods are sharply defined, and her final shift—from trying to control connection to inhabiting it—tracks cleanly. However, she rarely experiences conflicting impulses; even the catastrophe doesn’t crack her composure (“Mira did not panic; the unsettling calm had become her bones”), which mutes psychological complexity. The cost of her realization (loss of her prior approach, risk to the gallery) is more conceptual than emotionally felt. A bit more contradiction or embodied strain under pressure would deepen her as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation—to reclaim and translate starlight for a generation born in darkness—is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a navigation instructor feels specific and grounded. However, her inner life stays largely in the register of articulated philosophy rather than embodied contradiction; we don’t see much irrational fear, resentment, or selfishness to complicate her drive. The most vivid character beat is her tactile engagement with the corroded anchor link, where memory, loss, and hope briefly converge in action. Corin and the Tethian elder serve meaningfully as foils, but their pressure on Mara remains gentle and mostly affirming rather than truly testing her.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s compassion and curiosity are clear and consistent, and their choice to follow the pulse and then intervene is well motivated. However, interior conflict is light: they rarely experience contradictory impulses or genuine hesitation under pressure. The “contact tracer for hearts” concept gives personality but is not deeply probed for flaws or blind spots. The final stance (renewed purpose) feels earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marek’s fear-driven compulsion to return and their claustrophobia create a convincing, character-specific engine for the story. The tension between panic in tight spaces and the ethical need to witness is well embodied in details like the trembling hands and “bulkheads pressed like closing fists.” The choice to simply endure those seven seconds of communion reads as an earned form of stasis. The piece could push further into contradictory impulses in the peak moment (e.g., a sharper temptation to flee mid-communion) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The survivor’s fear, embodied in counting heartbeats and carrying the shard, is specific and consistent, and her choice to defragment the ghost to “fetch wisdom” is well motivated. Interior texture is strong but skews contemplative rather than conflicted; we rarely see truly contradictory impulses operating at once. Her final reorientation—carrying the shard as lesson rather than loss—feels earned by prior causality. The absence of on-page relationships limits the crucible for deeper character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is strong and specific—she wants to “translate texture into sound” before the language dies—and her actions consistently serve that goal. The piece gives her a distinct interior texture via how she reads birds, stone, and copper, rather than abstract feelings. Internal contradiction (success as failure; memorial vs futility) is present but remains more conceptual than fully dramatized in micro-choices. The final endurance into exhaustion and death reads as an earned stasis, though it’s more idea-driven than emotionally raw.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lyn’s motive—transmuting bitterness into a “cosmic joke”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to engage with the arrowhead and the phone earns the final transformation. However, her interiority leans on stated emotion rather than embodied contradiction; we’re told she’s bitter more than we feel it in specific, conflicted reactions. Elian and Mira are largely emblematic, exerting little direct pressure beyond Elian’s brief speech, so relationships don’t fully serve as a crucible. The change at the end is convincing enough, but the psychological cost reads abstract rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s core motive—refusing a mechanized silence and trying to reawaken beauty—is clear, consistent, and escalates plausibly from playing to self-sacrifice. Her embodied experience (heart stuttering, fear of turning to stone) grounds the lyricism. Internal contradiction (self-preservation vs. willingness to “let [her] heart be uprooted from safety”) is present but could be deepened with more moment-to-moment doubt. The final transformation reads earned by prior beats of failure and stubbornness.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mailman’s guilt and “respectfully rebellious” stance give him a credible, specific motive, and his history with the burned letter ties cleanly to tonight’s mission. Interiority is mostly summarized rather than pressed into in-the-moment contradiction; we don’t see him waver between profit and penance, only hear that he has. The mother is sketched efficiently but remains more emblem than fully individuated person. The final sense of partial relief and ongoing return (“Tomorrow, he would return…”) reads as earned stasis rather than an unearned cure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is clearly motivated by a craftsman’s devotion and a belief in silence-as-possibility, and his actions (persistent repair, entering the wrong door, restoring the halo) are consistent. However, he lacks on-page contradiction or real internal conflict; he moves through the story as a serene, almost emblematic figure. His emotional life is inferred rather than dramatized through specific, conflicting impulses. The final “smiled, knowing…” lands more as a gentle affirmation than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The librarian’s motivation (locating the zeroth volume / place where stories live) is clear, consistent, and drives her actions, and her sanely eccentric professionalism feels particular rather than generic. However, her interiority remains mostly implied rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of conflicting impulses or cost as she pursues the goal, and she never truly struggles or doubts. The corduroy man has a specific, evocative presence but functions more as a foil or chorus than as a pressure source. The ending offers a reconfiguration of her understanding rather than a felt personal sacrifice, which limits the emotional arc’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian’s motivation—recover the escaped dream before daylight—remains clear and consistent, and her micro-choices with the camera and palette track logically with that goal. Interiority is more archetypal than deeply individuated, but it’s coherent and emotionally legible. The key realization that the palette “didn't bind dreams but gave them language” credibly motivates her pivot from capture to release. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or visible internal struggle under pressure; she moves from insight to insight with little friction.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Merrin is sharply sketched—a tradesperson of metaphysical truths whose contradiction (she frees others’ ideas but can’t unlock her own fear) lands cleanly in the final beats. The client is thinner but functional, embodied mostly through trembling hands and grief-gasp reactions. Motivation is clear for both: the woman wants her mother’s truth freed; Merrin is driven by vocation and a half-acknowledged hunger for her own release. Emotional shifts feel credible if muted; the piece could push further into conflict between Merrin’s competence and her private longing to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s curiosity and professional identity as a “hands-on folklorist” clearly drive his choices, and his final stance—choosing not to return, accepting that some mysteries should remain—feels earned. The link between his flaw (chronic curiosity) and the cost (lost memories, disillusionment) is strong. However, his emotional life is more stated than embodied; we’re told about nostalgia and fear of unanswered questions more than we viscerally feel his conflict in-situation. A touch more contradiction or bodily stress under pressure would deepen him into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist is sharply etched—her backward walking, tremor as she pours tea, and “blade wrapped in silk” voice all feel particular and embodied. Her central tension between reclaiming freedom and continuing to mentor Lin is clear and credible, with the final choice to remain reading as an earned endurance rather than a twist. Lin is quieter but not generic; her white-knuckled grip on the mug and widening eyes give her a distinct emotional presence. The piece could push further into genuine internal contradiction under pressure—there’s little moment where the archivist truly wavers or risks hurting Lin to pursue her own return.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vespera’s core motive and role are clear and consistent, and her final collapse plus stained hands register as a believable cost, but her interior life is mostly asserted rather than dramatized. “Insatiably creative” functions more as label than lived contradiction; we don’t feel her wrestling with draining already-dying worlds or any serious doubt. The 300-year backstory and burden of duty are evocative but skimmed. As a result, she feels mythic and archetypal rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s guilt, fear, and desire to atone are specific and consistently rooted in the trauma of the spiral storm and her father’s rescue boat, and her choice to use the forbidden method feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“her voice cracking like old varnish”) and emotionally layered, not generic. The final shift—accepting the spirits as “architecture” rather than a burden—registers as a meaningful, costly reconfiguration rather than a neat fix. A slight tendency to articulate insight (“the brokenness wasn’t in the asking, but in the carrying alone”) rather than fully dramatize it keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s methodical curiosity and empathy are clearly established and consistently motivate her actions, especially in the frame-by-frame analysis and her decision to document quietly rather than proclaim. However, she encounters little genuine resistance or inner contradiction, so her shift to “shielded openness” feels more like a deepening of an already-present trait than a pressured, costly change. Embodied emotion is present but muted; she moves through the discovery with poised reverence rather than struggle. The result is strong, coherent characterization that lacks a sharper crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cassian’s motivation (“to understand the physics of letting go”) is specific, consistent, and borne out in his behavior—he measures instead of mourning. His analytic nature shapes concrete micro-choices: density, viscosity, decay rates, the slate note. Mort’s presence adds a subtle relational pressure without stealing focus, and their status dynamic (human vs Death) is quietly legible. The main limitation is that Cassian’s internal conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.5)
    Characters function more as archetypal figures (balladeer, ghost, scribe) than as individuated people with textured interiority, and their motives (“to articulate unspoken needs”) are asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The balladeer never faces a real dilemma or cost; she simply does what she’s meant to do. The scribe’s echoing of the same drive feels thematically neat but psychologically thin. This keeps the emotional impact from matching the conceptual richness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kai’s motivation—to understand whether their years of service held meaning beyond duty—is clear, consistent, and deepened by the reverse-chronology diary entries. Interiority is specific (“curiosity that bordered on devotion”) and actions (putting on the goggles, reading, then choosing to leave the goggles behind) align with that drive. The emotional journey from anxious curiosity to bittersweet, contained grief reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but muted; Kai doesn’t visibly waver between competing impulses so much as move steadily toward comprehension, which slightly flattens potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is sharply sketched as a poetic scientist with a specific obsession, concrete history, and clear through-line from mentor loss to present crisis. Her motives are consistent and believable, and her micro-choices (recording Thorne’s truth instead of focusing on survival) reveal priorities. However, she experiences little on-page internal contradiction or degradation under stress, so the final stance feels like confirmation rather than a conflicted evolution. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual (“microburst of despair”) more than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s core drive (to “mirror the sky inside walls”) is clear and consistent, and his ritual with the coin gives him a distinct, embodied interiority. However, he feels more like a beautifully described function than a fully contradictory person; we don’t see genuine internal friction between, say, loyalty to the library vs. self-preservation or despair vs. defiance. His final acceptance of limits is conceptually earned but not strongly dramatized through competing impulses on the page. The lack of another on-page character also denies us relational pressure to expose sharper facets of him.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s curiosity and solitude are clearly motivated and consistent, and her occupational focus (maps, sextants, coordinates) feels lived-in. However, she encounters almost no real resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or embodied emotional stress under pressure. Her “sociable isolation” is named and lightly dramatized but not meaningfully tested. Kess is functional but thin, exerting little pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The locksmith’s goal and temperament are clear, but she remains more archetype than individuated person, with little contradiction or genuine vulnerability under pressure. Her emotions are mostly summarized (“driftwood nostalgia tugged at her heart”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final realization about “the rhythm of repair” feels thematically apt but not deeply earned through difficult micro-choices. Still, actions do align with her stated motive, and there is a modest sense of growth by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivations are clear—the ghost wants to save the orchard; the community wants to follow his guidance—but there is almost no interiority or individualized conflict. The “former strangers had become family” are treated as a single, harmonious unit with no friction, which limits character depth. The ghost’s altruism is asserted rather than tested against any competing impulse or doubt. As a result, change feels more like a fable’s given than an earned psychological evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The adjuster is specific and emotionally legible, with clear vocation, burden, and a concrete promise to the boy that drives her choices. Her internal contradiction—curator of endings who wants to grant mercy—is woven through the key beats. However, “beautifully flawed” stays more as a repeated label than a dramatized limitation shaping a hard trade-off on the page. The piece leans a bit more on archetypal gravitas than on idiosyncratic, embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s reluctance versus inherited duty is sharply drawn and made concrete in small choices (“wishing just once that she could let them fumble” while still acting). Her emotions are embodied through tactile familiarity with the nut and the orchard rather than label-speak. The internal contradiction holds through to an earned stasis ending where she continues the burden at personal cost. Only minor limitation is that we see her in one mode and situation, so her range under different pressures isn’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s grief, guilt, and scientific mind are clearly rendered, and her actions (coming to the ravine, releasing the chrysalis, designing the polymer) align with that motivation. However, internal conflict is fairly one-directional: she moves from constriction to release with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage. The relationship with the dead sister is emotionally potent but mostly summarized rather than dramatized in a way that pressures present choices. The final shift toward “continuous weaving of the past into the present” feels earned but somewhat tidy, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor and the first woman are conceptually vivid and consistent, but they remain largely archetypal, with little embodied interiority or contradiction beyond their functions as “clean slate” giver and seeker. Motivation is clear—she wants a beginning, the vendor wants to remain threshold-bound—and actions align with those desires. The most interesting character beat is the vendor’s refusal to incise her own story, but this is stated rather than deeply felt on the body. Emotional nuance is mostly abstracted into metaphors of light and absence rather than dramatized as concrete, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The chef’s inner life is specific, sensorial, and consistent, with his craft, flaws, and ethics all visible in his choices—especially when he refuses to “sandpaper” the daughter out of existence and instead absorbs the pain. His motives (to help, but through self-endangerment) are clear and deepen under pressure. The woman is thinner but still legible as a concentrated presence of remorse rather than a cipher. The final endurance choice forecloses an easier path and carries a convincing emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, coherent, and consistently enacted—her drive to “construct bridges from silos” shapes every choice. However, she reads as almost entirely virtuous, with little internal contradiction or felt doubt, which flattens potential complexity. Emotional states are mostly implied through actions and summary rather than embodied reaction under pressure. Secondary characters are vivid but lightly sketched, serving the arc more as emblems than as pressures on her.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Her motivation is vivid and specific—“to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams”—and her actions align with this throughout. However, interior conflict is more asserted than dramatized; the risk that “the modifier becomes modified” is named but not really struggled with on the page. Emotional texture skews conceptual rather than embodied, so we don’t feel her tension in a concrete way. The final shift toward becoming an “artifact” is more thematic than a cost she viscerally pays.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The archivist’s goal and competence are clear, and her actions consistently follow from her desire to protect the archives. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or moral friction; she moves from task to task with steady resolve. Emotions are often abstractly labeled (“latent blaze of purpose”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular ways. The final stance (quiet vigilance) feels gently earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sculptor’s desire to coax music from silence is clear and consistently enacted, and her vocation (tree-song sculptor) gives her interiority some specificity. However, her emotional life is idealized and largely unconflicted; we rarely see competing impulses or a genuine risk to her sense of self. The empathy toward linemen and animals is evocative but not tested. The closing stance feels more like an affirmation than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s guilt, precision, and conflicted love for Mira are vividly articulated, with the chess metaphors and exile details giving him specificity beyond archetype. His final renunciation—choosing absence as the “greatest move”—is well motivated by his history and beliefs. Internal contradiction (yearning for connection vs. belief that he must disappear) is present but could be sharpened by one more concrete temptation or alternative choice on the page. Overall, he feels fully realized for the length, if a bit contemplatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (recovering a locked memory, seeking empathy through silence) is clear and consistent, and her methods feel rooted in her particular obsessions. Interiority is specific in places (“Silence of anticipation, metallic, cold, waiting”), but her emotional life remains relatively smooth, with little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. The change at the end—toward shared listening and unlocked empathy—feels earned but low-cost. The neighbor relationship is only lightly sketched and doesn’t seriously pressure or complicate her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is clearly motivated—his ambition, ritual habits, and desire to “cultivate serenity within motion” are well established and consistent. However, he faces almost no resistance, and there is little internal contradiction or cost; he never has to sacrifice or doubt to get what he wants. Emotional texture is present but mostly tranquil and affirming, so we don’t see him under genuine pressure. The final realization feels earned but low-stakes rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motivation is clear, consistent, and concretely tied to family and livelihood, and her competence as a pilot/orchard-keeper feels specific. However, her interiority rarely shows genuinely contradictory impulses under pressure; she mostly glides from determination to insight with little friction. The final realization about resilience is thematically apt but comes a bit cleanly, without visible struggle or moral cost on the page. Still, her choices (launching, trusting the arrow, touching the seed, deciding to change orchard practice) are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The investigator is competent, methodical, and clearly motivated by preventing future accidents, but her interiority remains largely procedural and abstract (“cultivate foresight in action”) rather than conflicted or deeply embodied. We don’t see contradictory impulses or a significant emotional cost as she works. Her choices are aligned with her role, yet they reveal limited nuance beyond professionalism and grim purpose. The character feels solid but not yet distinctive or transformative at a literary-elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    Lyra’s motive is clearly stated and consistent, but she functions more as an emblem than as a psychologically complex person. There’s almost no internal contradiction or doubt; she never seriously questions the ritual or fears failure. Her emotional life is mostly implied through setting rather than embodied in specific sensations or conflicted thoughts. The ending delivers change, but without a felt personal cost for her, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s regret, competence, and conflicted desire for both penance and power are clear and specific, dramatized through concrete behaviors (driftwood markers, handling the flute) rather than labels. His internal shift from trying to “escape” failure to accepting it as a “door” feels earned by what he does and witnesses. The main limitation is that his internal conflict is more stated than dramatized in a few places, smoothing over messy ambiguity. Nonetheless, his final stance—carrying the flute as burden and bridge—lands as a credible, costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Cassian’s motivation is clear and specific—an almost pathological need to solve “the mathematics of emotion”—and his contradictions (precision vs. turbulence, empathy vs. control) feel organically tied to his actions. The device of “borrowing personalities” generates real inner friction, especially when the mathematician’s coldness and the poet’s joy collide in him. However, his emotional life is rendered more conceptually than somatically; we get abstractions like “a bright wave that threatened to drown his calculations” rather than concrete bodily reactions under pressure. The clients function almost purely as instruments in his experiment, offering little relational pressure beyond their roles as data sources.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courier has a clear desire (to coax wonder from the routine) and a meaningful final choice (giving up the pendant), but his inner conflict is underdeveloped and the decision feels relatively unpressured. The mentor relationship is sketched rather than dramatized, so his realization about her becoming myth lands more as statement than earned emotional turn. The child is more of a catalyst than a character with her own pressure. Emotional embodiment leans on lyrical description instead of distinct, character-specific textures under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Seraphine is sharply drawn as a paradoxical figure—mystic and rigorous empiricist—and her motives (proof vs communion) are clear and specific. Her shift from seeking data to accepting herself as an “instrument” feels earned by the progressive deepening of her encounter with the car and prism. The story gives embodied cues to her experience (teeth-hum, standing unmoving, neural pathways “rewritten”) rather than abstract labels. A touch of thematic telling (“Her motivation was proof, yet what she sought now was communion”) slightly flattens what the scene already shows, keeping this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s core motivation—to reach her daughter and mend the world’s fraying silence—is clear and consistent, and her final sacrifice follows plausibly from thirty years of waiting. However, her internal conflict at the crucial moment is underplayed; she gives up memories rapidly and almost serenely, with little on-page hesitation or contradiction beyond the lyrical framing. Emotion is largely externalized into objects (bead, loom, puzzle) rather than embodied in specific sensations or irrational impulses. The final endurance/renunciation reads earned but somewhat smoothed, limiting psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ren’s meekness, inherited values, and quiet determination are clearly established and consistently motivate his choices, culminating in a credible inner shift from apologetic to deliberate. The trade of his mother’s rings and his relationship to meekness as both shield and flaw give him a particular, not generic, psychology. However, the internal conflict at the peak—whether to give up his defining meekness—resolves a bit smoothly, with limited on-page struggle or irrational back-and-forth in the exact moment of barter.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lira has a clear role and competence, and her reactions to the shard and rift are coherent, but her inner life feels thin beyond a generalized sense of burden. The “withheld truth” about her predecessor arrives as a clean info-drop rather than something she struggles toward, so internal conflict is more told than dramatized. Her final acceptance of guardianship feels thematically right but emotionally under-complicated. That keeps the arc from reaching a truly memorable, character-specific turn.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Caleb’s reticence, sense of duty, and “warmly observant” nature are clearly dramatized through his routines, attention to detail, and quiet ritual with the cairn. His motivation to protect both the literal light and the emotional “feeling of safety” is coherent and drives his choices. Internal contradiction (comfort vs. unease with the ghost, isolation vs. connection through letters) is present but only lightly probed rather than fully dramatized in conflict. The final endurance—continuing the chain and guarding the light—is credible but could carry sharper, more specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Herald has a distinct role and desire (to steer a new dawn) but very little embodied, scene-level interiority—her emotions are mostly labeled (“shadowed elation”) rather than textured. Her accidental-prophet realization is a strong character beat, yet it arrives more as statement than as a conflicted moment of choice with cost. We don’t see contradictory impulses dramatized (fear of speaking vs need to guide; temptation to stay silent vs intervene). As a result, she feels mythic and interesting but not fully humanly complex at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dye master is specific, embodied, and motivated by a clear, particular obsession; their watchfulness, craft, and post-surgery disorientation all cohere. The internal shift from analytic seeker of a “formula for meaning” to embodied vessel for stories is earned by the donor-heart reveal. However, the stranger functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a pressured character, and we rarely see the master caught in genuine contradiction or moral friction—most of the arc is acceptance rather than conflict. This keeps the emotional cost of their transformation relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara has a clear, coherent motivation—understanding what the trees witness and making sense of sorrow—and her choices trace that arc cleanly. However, she encounters little real resistance, internal or external, and almost every step is accepted without hesitation or contradiction. Her emotions are mostly implied through atmosphere rather than embodied in specific, character-particular reactions. The final healing of her old wound is touching but arrives more as a lyrical grace note than the endpoint of a dramatized inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to rekindle the realm even at the cost of his own memory—is clear and consistent, and the final sacrifice feels earned by the accumulated hints of his role. However, interiority tends to be summarized rather than dramatized; we’re told about his amnesia and purpose more than we inhabit his confusion or competing impulses in the moment. The best character work is around his decision to sing despite the cost, but we don’t see much genuine internal conflict, only acceptance. This keeps him slightly archetypal rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s characterization as a “compassionate recluse” with a paradoxical need for solitude and connection is clear and consistent, and her core choice (to stop hiding the invitation) feels earned. Her internal conflict—staying vs. leaving, hiding vs. revealing—is well-articulated and threaded through the piece. However, emotions skew conceptual rather than embodied; we get more thesis than visceral feeling, which slightly mutes the cost of her final decision. The epiphanic insight around the Society and her error arrives quickly and smoothly, with limited experiential friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motive—to resist creeping erasure by tending the ordinary as sacred—is clear, consistent, and made concrete in her choices, especially the bread ritual and gardening. Her interiority is implied more through action than explicit thought, but it still feels specific (e.g., carrying the loaf “like a relic”). The congregation members are sketched economically yet distinctly through their reactions at the benediction. The main limitation is that Mara verges on emblematic/saintly, with little visible internal conflict or contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The chief’s motivation—to preserve meaning against oblivion—is clear and consistent, and his professional habits feel plausibly linked to that goal. However, his interior life remains largely abstract; we don’t see contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. His “gently meticulous” nature is told more than dramatized in tense micro-choices. The ending registers as quiet satisfaction rather than a conflicted or costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation (protecting the truce and her subculture) is clear, specific, and drives each choice, with the watch fob and her mother’s disappearance deepening her interiority. Her persistence, learning from false starts, and willingness to act alone sketch a coherent, particular person. Internal contradiction is mild—she’s anxious but competent—so the psychology feels slightly tidy rather than jagged. Still, the final endurance (carrying the recorded betrayal while keeping the market ignorant) lands as an earned, character-rooted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s skepticism, sensory way of knowing, and gradual shift toward accepting the unsolvable are clear, specific, and motivated by her long-standing search to “learn why some people carry weather.” The weather-carrier is sketched quickly but distinctly, applying immediate conceptual pressure that catalyzes Elara’s change. The final renunciation (choosing not to report, surrendering the ring) feels earned by the prior build-up of her need for proof versus lived experience. Internal contradiction could be sharpened earlier on the page—her doubt and desire mostly sit side by side rather than grinding against each other in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elena’s grief, fear of the blank page, and obsessive memory are clear and coherent, and her choice to start drawing again feels earned. However, her interiority leans on abstract statements about creativity and memory rather than dramatized contradictory impulses in the moment. We’re told more than shown how her mnemonic gift “imprisons” her, and there’s limited embodied, character-specific detail under peak pressure. The final change is convincing but could carry deeper, messier ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The calligrapher’s motivation and trait set (candor-obsessed, physically affected by lies, driven to find lost conversations) are clear and consistent, and her occupational detail is well used. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized (regret over past dishonesty) rather than dramatically pressured on the page. The shift at the end toward “replanting” lost honest moments is convincing but emotionally tidy. A stronger sense of contradiction-in-the-moment under pressure (e.g., real temptation to lie or turn away from the archive) would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner’s motivation—to preserve and then transmit wonder—is clear, consistent, and pays off in her final realization with the child. Interiority is present but often rendered in lofty summary rather than concrete, embodied conflict, so her sacrifices feel more conceptual than viscerally lived. The child functions more as a catalyst and receptor than as a fully realized character. The erosion of the tuner into her work is strong and legible, but it unfolds more as stated condition than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android’s motivation (“resolve inner static,” tend the roses, honor Emma) is clear and consistently tied to specific choices, especially the deliberate short circuit to ignite the fire. Interiority is particular—ceramic joints, processor fragments, nostalgic for “a childhood never lived”—and avoids generic emotion labels. Internal conflict (duty/protocol vs. need for psychic coherence) is present but could be heightened; the cost of violating safety protocols feels more conceptual than viscerally agonizing. The final shift into a more fluid, “strangely organic” movement reads as earned, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect the courtyard and prove that “listening heals”—and her actions align well with this. However, interiority is thin and largely summarized; we rarely see conflicting impulses or embodied emotional struggle in scene. Elena and Samir are sketched with emotional clarity but remain lightly drawn. The final state change (Mira’s deeper purpose, Elena as caretaker) feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lyra’s motivation—turning vulnerability into encoded strength to escape—is clear and consistent, and her patience/ingenuity under pressure feel character-specific. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than embodied; we’re told her “spirit remained unbroken” instead of feeling her fear, doubt, or contradictory impulses in the moment. Her calm defiance is compelling but risk-free emotionally because she never seriously falters or questions. The final calm-walk-away lands, but it’s earned more conceptually than through dramatized internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—to retrieve Mara’s lost memory—flows cleanly from the opening beats (gravity pockets, the whale, Mara’s blankness) into his research and descent, and his occupational detail (lantern lighter) is nicely fused to his choices. Interiority is specific and embodied through weight, breath, and tools rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Mara, though mostly off-stage, still feels real enough that her line at the end lands with emotional cost. If anything, his internal conflict could be pushed slightly harder at the chamber—he never truly contemplates failure or a darker cost to taking the memory back.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s core motivation—to hush a catastrophic prophecy—is clear and consistent, and his craft choices (folding cranes, placing them counter to the brook’s flow) are directly tied to that drive. His interiority has specificity (“some futures must remain unspoken”) and the late doubt about stealing the brook’s wisdom adds moral texture. However, emotional states are more described than embodied; we don’t feel his fear or stakes in the body so much as hear them articulated. The internal conflict only fully surfaces near the end, rather than actively complicating earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Alex’s curiosity and Mrs. Voss’s role as guardian of the building’s “grammar” are clear and consistent, and Mrs. Voss in particular feels vividly idiosyncratic (“a woman who moved like a well-worn manuscript page”). The progression from borrowing sugar to becoming the building’s scribe is motivated and legible. However, Alex’s interior conflict is fairly light; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or real resistance to the responsibility they assume. The emotional cost of becoming the building’s translator remains more implied than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s mix of rationalism and longing is specific and consistent, with clear motivation (archive the sister, defend herself with equations) that credibly shifts when she chooses to “surrender her equations.” The isolation/connection paradox is embodied in her habits (three years of visits, carrying the shell) and her final willingness to feel rather than translate. Internal conflict could be dramatized with a bit more in-the-moment resistance; she yields to the garden’s logic relatively smoothly. Still, the before/after stance change is legible and earned with a felt cost to her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—avenging her father and “forgiv[ing] the unfinished”—is clear and consistently tied to specific actions (forging, uttering the phrase, triggering the mechanism). Interiority is present but relatively simple; there’s little live internal contradiction or genuine doubt in the moment of treason. Her competence feels slightly over-secure, with no visible mistakes or psychological wobble under pressure. The emotional cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized in her body and conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Echo Singer has a clear driving want (to learn why some people echo) and a defined role as keeper of echoes, and her choice to preserve rather than “solve” her lost love’s echo gives her a modest but real arc. However, she remains more archetype than individual—no concrete biographical or behavioral specifics—and her emotional states are often labeled in repeated phrases (“reed-blown melancholy”) rather than embodied in fresh, character-particular ways. Internal conflict exists (curiosity vs. the pain of remembering) but is told more than dramatized in on-page micro-choices. The final acceptance of some mysteries feels plausible but not deeply earned by prior contradictions or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s core drive—salvaging a “pure memory” and giving Elias peace—is consistent and tracks cleanly from shrine to wreck to aftermath. Her professional identity as a wreck-diver/ghost whisperer feels grounded, and the lie-by-omission about Elias’s mother is a strong, character-revealing choice. However, her internal conflict over that choice is only implied rather than dramatized in embodied detail, which softens the emotional cost. Elias functions mostly as a gentle presence rather than a pressure-exerting character, keeping the relational crucible relatively mild.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The philosopher and Kael are sketched with clear roles and a consistent inner stance, but they lack real contradiction or pressure that would force difficult choices. The philosopher’s “demure audacity” is told and symbolized more than dramatized under stress; the villagers’ scorn stays abstract. Kael’s skepticism softens quickly without visible internal struggle. The resulting change feels gentle and credible but not deeply earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is clearly motivated—profession, temperament, and method (pattern-collector, debunker) all align, and his micro-choices (digging, reassembling, deciding to confront the council) feel grounded. His observational bias feels character-specific, not generic. However, internal conflict is underplayed: we’re told the stakes (heretic, cursed, ostracized) but see little live struggle over who “deserves” the truth or whether to withhold it, which would deepen him at this length. The lack of any on-page relational crucible (no council member or settler in scene) limits how fully his flaws and values are tested.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atlas’s motives (lonely devotion to the transmissions, split loyalty between Council and prophecy, desire to “shape that dawn”) are clear and consistent, and his final choice to betray the Council logically follows. The interiority is vivid but somewhat generalized—his fear, doubt, or selfishness under pressure are gestured at more than dramatized. Internal conflict (“variant allegiance”) is more conceptual than embodied, so the cost of his decision feels slightly abstract. Still, he reads as a specific, non-stock figure anchored in his work and solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The poet’s desires (redemption, translating silence, preserving memory) are clear and consistently embodied in her choices: salvaging the music box, inventing the jars, then sharing the preserved songs. Her interiority is vivid and specific (“hands, stained with ink and salt”), and the shift from selling penny verses to freely gifting humming poems feels earned. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or moment where her motives pull against each other under pressure; she evolves, but without much internal friction. The change from “vagrant” to rooted conduit is conceptually strong but could use one more concrete, costly renunciation to deepen character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The engineer has clear, coherent motivation (duty to the lighthouse/sacred artifact) and a distinct inner split between training (“parse fear as frequency”) and compassion for the parasite. Her emotional life is embodied in sound, temperature, and pressure, not generic feeling labels. The main limitation is that we see only one mode of her—high-competence, high-empathy under duress—without much sense of her flaws beyond costly empathy. The final shift (her heart now tuned differently) is earned but could land harder if more of her pre-scene baseline or potential blind spots were dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core motivation—“to sculpt patience from impatience”—is clear and coherently embodied in her long preparation and timing of the revolution. We see a believable, competent specialist whose choices (waiting, calibrating, triggering the pulses) align with that motive. However, her internal conflict is largely summarized as past learning rather than dramatized in the present tense; she never visibly wavers or pays an on-page emotional price at the moment of action. The endurance change is credible but a bit too tidy and untroubled for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motives (truth, worker safety, breaking Voss’s control) are clear and consistently expressed through her evidence-gathering and refusal to answer the phone. The link to her grandmother and the lantern adds individuality and a credible value hierarchy. Internal tension between fear and resolve is present but often summarized in abstractions like “fortified vulnerability” rather than dramatized in specific sensations or irrational thoughts. The final choice to defy Voss is well motivated but could feel richer with a sharper, more embodied glimpse of what she stands to lose.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chaplain’s internal conflict—penance vs purpose—is clear, specific, and credibly reweighted by the end, and Elias’s off-stage presence feels psychologically real through his choices. Marlowe’s motivation is embodied in his craft and quiet ethic rather than explained. However, emotions tend to live in thematic abstraction (“seeking second opinions,” “asked not for mercy but for meaning”) more than in embodied sensation, which slightly blunts impact. A touch more concrete, character-particular feeling under pressure would push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zephyr’s curiosity, irreverent awe, and private motive to “ring a bell no one hears yet” are specific and consistent, and her choices (pocketing the arrow tip, feeding it through the kaleidoscope) clearly arise from those traits. However, her internal conflict is muted: she rarely feels torn between risks to the workshop and her drive to push the algorithm. Emotional responses stay mostly conceptual rather than bodily or messy, which slightly flattens peak beats. The ending’s stance—content to keep helping an endless yearning—reads more as a cool idea than a choice with fully felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper’s desire to uncover what happened to the missing engineers is clear and consistent, and her key choices (lying to the AI, copying the video, creating the mirror) align with that drive. However, she experiences little visible internal contradiction or fear, so the emotional cost of defying the corporation remains mostly implied. Her interiority is serviceable but generic at points (“felt the weight of a thousand vanished voices”), with limited character-specific texture beyond her role. The closing shift toward quiet hope is believable but not hard-earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation (acting when others freeze, mapping empathy onto action) is clear and consistent, and their calm, shadow-laced interiority feels particular rather than generic. The child volunteer’s fear/courage mix is sharply sketched and credible in the moment. However, Kael’s internal conflict is underplayed—there’s little sense of competing impulses or genuine doubt at the key decision points, so the emotional cost skews conceptual more than felt. The relationship with Elder Mara and the community functions but could bear more live tension to deepen the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist’s motivation—arriving as a euthanasia tourist and drifting toward service—is clear, consistent, and organically reweighted by her on-page experiences. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (the parasol, the photograph, the way numbness “felt like a distant echo”), and her final stance is credibly earned from prior beats. The internal conflict between wanting an ending and seeking to mend others’ endings is present, though it could surface with a touch more contradictory simultaneity in peak moments. The closing renunciation of her original goal carries felt cost but stops short of being fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sentinel’s desires and temperament are clear, and his small sequence of choices (pocketing the fragment, deciding to write, burying the vial) coheres with a contemplative, caretaker personality. However, his internal conflict remains mild: we’re told of a “quiet ache” and unresolved love, but contradictory impulses or costs never sharpen into a real dilemma. The emotional palette risks sameness—gentleness and wistful insight dominate without much disruption or irrationality. The final stance (honoring fragile remnants rather than resolving them) feels apt but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    The line walker’s core motivation (preserving the echo) is clear and consistent, and her ritual actions align with it. However, interiority is thin and largely summarized; we don’t feel competing impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The prophet is a distant figure with no real relational crucible on the page. The ending “change” is more a completion of a task than an earned internal shift with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s motivation—to transmute communal pain into an evolving masterpiece—is clear and coherently carried through, and her actions (arranging arcs, starting the continuous photograph) align with this. However, she remains almost entirely serene, with little internal contradiction or felt cost to her role. Emotional states are more often summarized than embodied from inside her skin, which flattens potential complexity. The widow and child work well as touches of relational pressure but are too brief to deepen her character under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a reticent, obsessive scholar whose lifelong question about how knowledge grows cleanly motivates every choice. His realization that his own name yields “nothing” is a credible, devastating pivot that reconfigures his self-concept rather than feeling like a grafted epiphany. The shift from passive listening to actively reading aloud under time pressure is an earned evolution of his flaw. A touch more embodied contradiction under peak stress (physiological response, flashes of pettiness or anger) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prophet’s longing and futility are clearly motivated and consistent, and we feel his particular way of thinking through objects like the chalk and tapes. Internal contradiction—wanting to capture time while knowing it will be lost—runs through the piece without being over-explained. Micro-choices (following the driftwood, opening the VCR, drawing the spiral, then accepting forgetting) are legible and aligned with his nature. He still reads slightly archetypal rather than fully individuated, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation (to capture the dying star’s light and stabilize the observatory) is clear and consistent, and his competence as a “sage camera repairer” is convincingly dramatized in the clock repair. However, his emotional life is rendered in fairly general abstractions (“luminous ache,” “his heart a quiet drum”) with little contradiction or real dilemma under pressure. The final stance—accepting the ache and listening for the next whisper—feels earned but low-cost, more meditative than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is sharply etched—professional, serene, and quietly driven—and her choice to engineer a reconciliation through music feels grounded in her role and temperament. Mr. Harrow and Lena are sketched with enough specificity to carry the emotional weight, but their inner contradictions are only lightly touched, especially Lena’s long-estranged stance dissolving with minimal on-page struggle. Emotions are mostly embodied through sound and small gestures (fingers tapping, hesitation at the door), which works well. The main limitation is that no character faces a genuinely difficult, internally conflicted choice; the piece floats above messier impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (solve the riddle of noon shadows and prevent the “sealed awakening” from breaking loose) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a rune scholar is credibly shown. However, she faces little internal conflict; her “quiet, deliberate” nature never meaningfully clashes with fear, doubt, or impatience. Emotional embodiment is fairly muted: we get more procedure than felt stress as she works. The closing satisfaction is earned but low-cost, reading more as serene success than an arc with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and credible, from her investment in “folklore forensics” to the shock of realizing she mapped “the wrong sky.” Her conflicting impulses—to preserve a hard-won career vs. to correct harm—are legible in her questions and in the cost of asking Moira to help undo her work. Moira’s “shrewdly innocent” presence feels lived-in rather than gimmicky, with her calm dismantling of Elena’s certainty. The main limitation is that Elena accepts the new mission with relatively little on-page struggle, softening the edge of her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira’s core desire—to share light without fire, rooted in childhood stargazing with her father—is clear and consistent, and her gentleness reads as specific rather than generic. However, internal conflict is almost nonexistent; she encounters little resistance, doubt, or contradiction as she moves from grotto to square. Her emotional palette stays in a narrow band of quiet purpose and serenity, so her late realization about “the true gift” feels more like an articulation than a hard-won shift. The endurance/mission she embraces at the end could be more costly or ambivalent to deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and temperament are sharply drawn—her daily tending of moss, her relationship to the pendant, and her choice to make the data center a sanctuary all track cleanly with her history as a whistleblower. The interiority is specific and embodied (“weighed against her chest like the truth she’d finally spoken”), not generic. Internal conflict is present but muted; she seems already committed to her path, so we don’t see sharply dramatized contradictory impulses under pressure. The final decision to share the sanctuary feels earned but carries more quiet resolve than visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The novelist’s internal conflict between cynicism and tenderness is well-articulated and consistently motivates his choices, especially in the beat with the burned, “soft” novel and the younger self. Emotions are mostly conveyed through image and action (wading through wet ink, pressing the shell into earth), not label-only feeling. However, his arc resolves a bit too smoothly into freedom and wisdom, with minimal on-page resistance in the closing beats. The cameo figures are deliberately archetypal, but that also means they apply little individualized pressure back on him.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore the rite and the village’s memory—is clear and consistent, and her tinkerer background nicely colors her approach via music boxes. However, interiority is fairly generic and unconflicted; she never doubts, fails, or reveals a contradictory impulse. Emotional states are largely implied by setting rather than embodied in her body or specific thought. The final satisfaction feels earned but low-cost, with little sense of what she sacrifices or risks personally.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s motive—recovering her lost child via a dangerous, precise ritual—is clear and consistent, and her grief/hope tension is embodied in the patience vs. urgency of the Great Silence. Interiority is mostly shown through action and perception rather than abstract labels. However, contradictory impulses are implied more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices, so her internal conflict never quite reaches peak specificity. The realization about “sealing of sorrow” is earned but leans a bit toward articulated thesis rather than discovered through a sharp, pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The locksmith is specific and compelling—a solitary, peripherally focused craftsman whose way of seeing the world organically informs his methods. His motivation (understanding and reshaping the echo mechanism rather than merely fixing it) is clear and consistent. However, there is almost no internal conflict or felt emotional cost; he moves from problem to solution with serene competence, so the final “change” reads more as intellectual completion than pressured, value-testing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The weaver’s motivation—to measure and transmute her burdens as a path to release—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices with the lamp and the burdens. Interiority is rich and particular, filtered through craft metaphors (“threads of light and memory”) rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays fairly controlled and ceremonial; we rarely feel real doubt or resistance as she approaches the final, “simplest and most terrible” burden. A touch more tension or contradiction in that last choice would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s grief, desire to “harvest lessons from loss,” and choice to perform the crystallized-time ritual are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices around the lion and the quartz feel motivated. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction; she moves from intention to acceptance without many genuine doubts or regressions on the page. Emotion is mostly well-embodied through sensory detail, though a few lines slip into summary or near-platitude. The final stance—accepting transformation over clinging—feels earned but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and textured: the “resolute scavenger with eroded ambitions” gives us a vivid self-concept, and the tension between scavenging and the wish to “soar” creates genuine internal conflict. Motivation—to reconcile with their own ghost/self through narrative reconstruction—is clear and consistent. The final stance shift (from being haunted to “collaborators in the fractured stillness”) is earned by prior beats. Some emotional language leans abstract (“regret I carry feels like a stone in my throat”) rather than situationally embodied, which slightly blunts impact at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motives are clear and consistent—she wants to repurpose dead infrastructure into a conduit for hope, and her engineering mindset is well embodied in her actions. However, she encounters almost no resistance, and we see little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine doubt, which flattens her interiority. The “functionally creative” label is supported by behavior, but we don’t see a personal cost or flaw complicating her choices. The final realization about equations of hope feels earned enough, but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives—grief over her daughter’s departure and the abandoned dream of teaching—are specific and consistently drive her micro-choices (bringing the broken chronometer, choosing not to repair it, placing each gear). Her introversion and “excruciatingly gentle” nature feel embodied in the way she navigates the sanctuary, not just stated. The internal conflict (clinging to the dream vs. surrendering it) is present but managed smoothly rather than with sharp contradiction, keeping the arc believable if a bit tidy. The final renunciation reads earned, with a clear felt cost as she chooses not to look back.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation—to uncover the “architecture of lies”—is clear and consistently tied to her actions, and her competence with the sundial and instincts reads coherent. However, her emotional life is mostly labeled (“serene upheaval,” “thoughtfully clear”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly hesitation. There is little sense of genuine struggle or risk as she proceeds, so the final recommitment feels relatively low-cost. Stronger embodiment of doubt, fear, or moral ambivalence under pressure would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving seed knowledge) is clear and consistent, and her patience is embodied through her methodical work in the cold, but we rarely feel internal conflict or emotional risk beyond quiet determination. Her micro-choices—staying in the numbing cold, treating Kessler with respect, returning the rope without bargaining—sketch a principled, disciplined personality. The relationship with Kessler has a nice understated trust dynamic, though his pressure on her is minimal. The ending offers an earned endurance/renunciation (she accepts the cost of this marginal, unglamorous work), but the emotional price could be sharpened further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s vocation and motive are clear and particular, and her inner life is rendered through concrete sensory focus (thread, leaves, water). However, her emotional conflict stays relatively smooth—there’s little sense of genuine resistance or contradictory impulse around letting go. The final renunciation (dropping the thread, moving on) is earned but low-pressure, with the cost more implied than felt. Overall she reads distinct and coherent, but not yet deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lysander’s motivation—to revive beauty in a mechanized world—is clear and consistently embodied in his tinkering, scavenging, and care for the egg. His interiority is evocative but skewed toward summary and thesis (“he hypothesized that the egg's lingering essence had merged with the machine's logic”) rather than dramatized contradiction. We don’t see a sharp internal clash between fear and desire in any single pressured moment; his choices feel almost serenely aligned with his ideals. The final acceptance of the hybrid creature as “a new kind of beauty” is emotionally credible but not bought with a clearly dramatized, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya is sharply sketched—firefighter daughter of an arsonist, scarred, gentle, driven by compassion—and her choices align cleanly with that frame. Her motivation to redeem her father's legacy by tending the bird and repurposing the coin is clear and consistent. What’s missing is real contradiction or resistance: she never wavers, doubts, or pays a visible emotional price on the page, so her “change” at the end feels more like affirmation than earned shift. This keeps the arc from reaching the depth a top-tier publication would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Kael’s core motivation—to free the city’s trapped memories—is clear and consistent, and her “luminous skeptic” identity is at least partially dramatized in how she trusts the tale enough to act while retaining a questioning stance. However, her interiority stays relatively generalized (“quiet urgency,” “content that the memories were finally free”) rather than deeply embodied or contradictory under pressure. The story largely skips over moments where skepticism and belief could clash on the page, so her change feels more affirmed than earned. The emotional cost of carrying those memories is named but not really tested.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and consistent—her sentimentalism, inherited obligation, and fear of “fire” clearly drive her choices. The moment she reframes light as information and accepts the sentinel role is emotionally legible and earned. However, internal conflict is more stated than dramatized; we’re told she fears ignition and carries grief, but we rarely see her impulses truly pull in competing directions on the page. The relationship with the next generation is evocative but skimmed, limiting the felt cost of her final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand and embody collective grief—is clear and consistently expressed through his craft, the ribbons, and his attention to the monarchs. The grandmother’s ghost functions effectively as both mentor and pressure, and the brief appearance of the daughter concretizes the generational stakes. Emotional states are mostly shown via action and image (stone carving, tracing air, handling ribbons) rather than labels, and his final understanding feels earned. The main limitation is that his internal contradictions (duty vs. doubt, individual vs. communal grief) are more implied than dramatized in live dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara is sharply realized: her precision, inherited guilt, and clerk-like ethical sense all clearly drive her up the ridge and shape how she reads Marten’s confession. Her internal conflict—preserve a simpler, punishing lie vs. share a more destabilizing truth—is cleanly motivated and carried through to the end. The micro-choices (studying each inscription, pocketing the handle, how she winds afterward) credibly reveal a shift from grim penance to shared burden. The only ceiling is that we never see her under direct interpersonal pressure, so relational complexity is limited by design.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    The gardener’s motives (honor the dead, decode the tapestry) are clear and consistent, and his gentle, methodical nature comes through. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure, so the emotional arc feels more meditative than tested. The closing realization feels believable but not hard-won, with minimal visible cost. This keeps the characterization from reaching a more complex, high-literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen’s motivation and competence are vividly clear, and her professional mindset (“ignorance cartographer” using pattern stones and memory threads) feels particular rather than generic. However, her inner contradictions and emotional cost are only lightly sketched; she functions more as an idealized visionary than a fully conflicted person under strain. The elders are effectively outlined as a resisting force but remain mostly schematic. The final victory lands, but her internal struggle en route is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to smuggle story back into a starved world via music—is clear and consistent, and her occupational lens as a copyist feels specific. However, she faces little on-page opposition, and her inner life is more stated belief than dramatized contradiction; we don’t see a sharp conflict between fear and defiance in action. Her core choice (to transcribe the cipher) is assumed rather than pressured. The ending offers resolve and endurance but with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to crystallize a fleeting sense of safety tied to her mother—is clear and governs every move, and her ash-scattering practice gives her a concrete, particular identity. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (burned portraits, ash on her palms), though much of her conflict is articulated in conceptual terms (“safety is a mirage”) rather than dramatized through sharper, scene-level dilemmas. The contradiction between seeking safety and embracing its illusoriness does register, and her final acceptance reads as a modest but earned shift. Deeper, more embodied flashes of the mother or a more acute, on-page choice would strengthen the sense of costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Malach’s motives and worldview are distinct and coherent—his “rational rebellion” and commitment to method over myth are dramatized through concrete choices (living in the sewer, filing the cog, hiding it despite execution risk). Internal conflict between competing narratives plays out in his methodical weighing of evidence rather than melodrama, which suits the character. Emotional texture is intentionally cool and cerebral, which slightly limits felt contradiction or vulnerability under pressure. The final endurance choice (preserve method, accept personal erasure) is well-earned but could register with a touch more embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mrs. Kaelin and Marco are both sharply etched in a small space, with her “expectantly resigned” persistence and his history of weaponizing his voice playing directly into the central exercise. Motivation is clear—she wants to teach listening and unlearning, he risks vulnerability—and their choices under pressure (having each student offer a single unarmored note, Marco accepting the rosette) feel grounded in those traits. Internal contradiction exists but stays understated: she’s both resigned and hopeful; he’s both defensive and yearning to change. The primary limitation is that most emotional struggle is implied rather than deeply embodied on the page, keeping this just shy of fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s goal and history (grandmother, recipes, informal learning) are clear and consistently motivate her actions, and the memory-tasting power individualizes her. However, she encounters little real resistance or doubt; internal conflict and contradictory impulses are minimal, so the arc feels emotionally smooth. Her rebellion never forces a painful trade-off on the page. The final satisfaction is earned but low-friction for a piece aiming at elite literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is specific and memorable—an honest toll keeper with a truth-curse and an almost ritual relationship to the tower. Her micro-choices (raising the gate during blackout, climbing the tower, placing the honeycomb) clearly align with a temperament that finds meaning in routine. However, her interior conflict is muted; the “curse” never extracts much visible cost, and her shift into “keeper of wonder” feels like a deepening of what she already is rather than a pressured, ambivalent change. A touch more contradiction—resentment of the job, fear of breaking rules, or doubt about wonder—would move this toward top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The creeping normality noticer has a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct perceptual filter, but he remains more role than person. Interiority is mostly stated (“His motivation was simple, endless…”) rather than dramatized under pressure, and there’s almost no contradiction or real struggle. His emotional response to the houses’ transformation is muted and generalized, so the final “answer” feels more like a conceptual completion than a hard-won change. The lack of on-page cost or risky choice keeps the arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Petra’s internal contradiction—stone guardian of rigid truth becoming a keeper of questions—is clear, motivated, and earned by the diver’s final thought and the ampoule’s memories. Her “incisively kind nature” manifests in specific choices, like broadcasting the gardener’s death and refusing to demand the founders “unbecome” what they are. The emotional arc from dogma to nuanced acceptance lands, though moments like “Her purpose was not to preserve one truth” tip into telling the realization rather than fully dramatizing it. Costs remain more conceptual than personally painful on the page, which keeps this just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s grim optimism, mathematical obsession, and paternal regret cohere into a vivid, particular psyche, and his final refusal of the rupture reads as an earned endurance rather than a twist. Contradictory impulses—wanting escape, wanting punishment, wanting to “do it right” this time—are simultaneously present at the climax. Emotions are mostly embodied through his relationship to the steps and dice rather than labels. A slight limitation is that we glimpse the daughter only via summary; another concrete flash of that relationship might deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s characterization as an insomniac, methodically hopeful painter is clear, particular, and embodied in his routines (cataloguing scripts, perfecting ink, rooftop vigils). His motivation to awaken kindness in strangers consistently drives his choices, and Mira’s brief appearance feels like a real person with a past (the academy, the remembered gesture). Internal contradiction is mild—he accepts his insomnia rather than struggling against it—so his emotional arc is more confirmation than transformation. The endurance-choice at the end (continuing his vigil) is credible but low-cost, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Liora’s motivation is vivid and specific—rescuing dying arts in a crumbling, displaced community—and her actions (curating relics, inventing the bread ritual, wielding the lens) track cleanly with that drive. Her emotional life, however, leans more on lyrical labels (“rosewater dread,” “fragile hope”) than on textured, contradictory interior conflict. We rarely see her genuinely doubt, resent, or misstep under pressure; the piece offers resolve more than struggle. The final resolve to continue the ritual feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The clock maker’s motivation (reversing fate/curse) is clear and her competence is well-grounded in specific habits (“kept her tools aligned like a surgeon’s tray”), but there’s little on-page contradiction or real doubt under pressure. Her inner life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in conflicted moments. The keeper functions more as a lore-delivery device than as a source of real interpersonal pressure. The final sense of purpose feels earned enough but relatively low-cost and emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motivation (to understand and then outmaneuver the fear that now structures her life) is clear and sustained from attic to funhouse, and her internal contradiction—repelled yet drawn, terrified yet curious—is well dramatized (“Their beauty was a lie that made her stomach clench, an allure that pulled at her even as it repulsed”). Interiority is concrete, grounded in sensory perception and specific objects (the clasp biting into her palm). The near-clinical phrase “trauma-induced synesthesia” edges toward label-speak but is anchored in action and doesn’t dominate her self-concept. The final stance—a survivor who reframes screams as “witness”—feels earned by prior beats, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prophet’s motivation—to protect the orchard by turning threat into instrument—is clear and consistent, and her occupational specificity (tide prophet, dub priestess of storms) feels distinct. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she rarely experiences simultaneous fear and artistic exultation on the page, even though the situation invites it. Her emotional life is mostly implied through external ritual rather than embodied conflict, so the final renunciation/acceptance of perpetual vigilance carries limited felt cost. This keeps the piece from a deeper character arc even though the role itself is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s vocation, inherited pattern-language, and grief over her mother all feed a coherent, specific motivation that drives every beat, and her final choice to engage the watchers’ language rather than turn away feels earned. However, her interiority skews resolute and lucid; we get little simultaneous contradiction (fear vs drive) under peak pressure, which slightly flattens her complexity. The cost of her realization—that knowing the watchers separates her from those who still dream—is more conceptual than emotionally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Emlyn’s motivation to uncover and contextualize the noble lie is clear and consistent, and her “methodical heart” comes through in her choices (careful handling of the ledger, photographing the letter, framing it for colleagues). However, her interiority stays relatively smooth and principled; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine temptation to preserve the lie. The emotional response to the lord’s choice is felt but brief, and her ultimate decision never seems in doubt. The arc is more of steady enactment than pressured change, which limits depth at this prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn as a competent, methodical surveyor whose latent sensitivity is revealed through how he reads the ruins and handles the relics. His shift from bureaucratic functionary to “archaeologist of abandoned dreams” is motivated by specific discoveries (toy boat, locket) and the embodied labor of repair. The stoic/sensitive contradiction is dramatized in details like his underwater tears and the council misreading his “firmness.” The one limitation is that some interior realizations are stated a touch overtly rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivations and professional temperament are clear and consistent, and her methodical choices (studying watermarks, testing hypotheses, using the stamp) arise naturally from who she is. However, internal conflict is muted: her “logical mind” wrestling with conspiracy never quite produces a sharp, costly contradiction on the page. Emotional states are mostly inferred from calm behavior rather than richly embodied. The final moment of satisfaction feels earned but not especially hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lantern maker’s motivation is specific and consistent—grief, penance, and the drive to find her daughter’s breath give clear shape to every action. Her craft choices (what dreams to polish, how far to refine them, accepting others’ dreams) all flow credibly from that motive. What’s missing at a top-tier level is more on-page contradiction or resistance (she rarely hesitates, resents, or doubts), so the internal struggle feels relatively one-note even as it’s powerful. The final endurance as keeper/prisoner is earned but lands more as extension than pivot of an already-fixed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—survivor guilt channeled into a quasi-sacred act of witnessing—is vivid and consistent, and her professional competence is tightly integrated with her trauma. The embodied moments (“feel it in her teeth and bones,” the trembling hands, the “broken geode” heart) make her more than an abstract mourner. However, her internal conflict is stated more than dramatized; she rarely faces a concrete, resisted temptation or trade-off on the page beyond the general refusal to weaponize the energy. A sharper, situated micro-choice under pressure would push this toward the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s competence, observational acuity, and workmanlike problem-solving are clear and consistent, and her moment of emotional resonance when decoding the chip is earned by prior setup. However, interior conflict is light: she is rarely pulled between contradictory impulses, so her final understanding of why the pilgrim fled lands more as contemplation than as a hard-won shift. “Perpetually surprised” functions more as motif than as a trait that complicates choices. The piece would reach a higher band if one of her micro-choices (e.g., whether to transmit the frequency) carried on-page ambivalence or visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s guilt, profession, and maternal wound are clearly established and coherently drive his choices, especially the decision to stop forging histories. However, his interiority leans toward a single emotional register—regret—without much contradictory impulse on the page (e.g., no real temptation to keep his lucrative work). The mother relationship is strong as an off-stage pressure, but it remains more emblem than dynamically dramatized conflict. The final change of course is credible and motivated, though somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is clearly motivated, with the negotiator role, heirloom token, and desire to avoid past bloodshed giving him specificity and a coherent inner stance. However, his interiority stays fairly linear—duty shaded by mild doubt—without a truly fraught contradiction or a moment where opposing impulses pull him hard in-scene. Lin is a restrained but credible mirror, yet their relationship never quite becomes a crucible that forces a difficult choice between them. The final recommitment to “each mistake would become a lesson” feels earned but relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias is sharply drawn: a competent ex-navigator crushed by guilt, clinging to a dead compass as an emotional prosthetic. His internal contradiction—needing to move yet not trusting his own guidance—runs cleanly through the kayak journey. The final renunciation of the compass and turn toward the cemetery feel earned by the prior interiority. A touch of therapy-language abstraction slightly flattens otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    Kael’s core motivation and paradox (clean slate vs dirty past) are clear and consistent, and his actions line up with those aims. However, his internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; we’re told he once “hunted empathy” but never see that impulse in live tension with his present goals. Emotional reactions are somewhat generalized (“jaded wonder,” “weary expression tinged with hope”) rather than sharply embodied. The final shift into “keeper of empathy” feels earned enough, but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The beast whisperer’s motivation—reforging a bond at the cost of her humanity—is clear and consistent, and the reluctance around metamorphosis adds a credible internal tension. Her steadiness under pressure is shown through embodied ritual acts rather than just told. However, her interiority stays fairly generalized (devotion, calm, grief) and never crystallizes into more idiosyncratic, character-specific thought or contradiction. The beloved remains an abstract presence, so the relationship’s nuance is more symbolic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and specific to a postpartum mystic, with the vessel/thief contradiction giving her a genuine moral tangle (“cloudbound repentance…not as shame but as…recognition that she had been both vessel and thief”). Her motives—to locate “lost time” and reframe her perceived failures as a mother—clearly underlie each ritual act. The final acceptance of the crack as herself feels earned by the earlier guilt and wonder, not like a bolt-on epiphany. The only limitation is that pressure never forces a truly anguished or risky micro-choice beyond contemplative acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and specific: a pacifist AI who has committed a sin of omission and now must confront the violence embedded in her “nonviolence.” Her motives—atonement, caretaking, and the temptation of escape—are clear and in tension, particularly around Li’s suffering and the locked dimension. The stitching process turns her guilt into a series of micro-choices, embodying contradiction (desire to transcend vs. duty to remain). A slight reliance on abstract framing (“shadow work”) keeps the psychology a hair more conceptual than embodied at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s philanthropic history, current destitution, and compulsion to keep giving form a coherent, specific psychology, and his realization that “transformation…[is] a vibration you joined” feels earned by what we’ve seen. The backstory examples (school, house, spring, highway) effectively dramatize his pattern of unintended large-scale consequences. Internal conflict is more implied than actively dramatized in-scene—he does not visibly wrestle with alternative choices in the present, which slightly softens impact. Still, his final act of uncorking the bottles clearly crystallizes his value hierarchy and arc.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seren’s competence, vigilance, and “calmly inventive” nature are clear, and her choices consistently drive events, but her inner life and conflict remain underdeveloped. The line “Intrigue had coated the fort for months like rust” hints at long-term tension, yet we never see a specific personal cost or moral hesitation about betraying the commandant. Her emotional state is almost uniformly controlled, so the revolution feels expertly executed but not deeply felt. The final smile “a winking hush” is effective but not built on layered contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (the promise, the urge to decode the ocean’s patterns, the dread of her own dissolution) is clear and consistent, and her final refusal to fully restore friction is psychologically legible. The curse, promise, and vocation braid into a coherent interior life, with concrete actions (placing rocks, handling star dust) emerging from that mix. However, her internal conflict is mostly asserted (“a price she had not yet accepted”) rather than dramatized through moment-to-moment vacillation or embodied stress at the climactic choice. A bit more textured contradiction under peak pressure would be needed for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The poet’s interior life is rich and specific: his “furious tranquility,” the scars on his tongue as “geography of silence,” and his ambivalence between fear and the need to speak all feel embodied rather than labeled. His key choices—waiting for the storm’s rarefaction, opening the envelope, then deciding to write and descend—flow logically from this psychology. The internal conflict between self-censorship and self-expression is present on the page and resolves into an earned, if quiet, change (“the vigil was not a pause in time but a pause in fear”). The only shortfall is that the cost of that shift remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Rhen’s core motive—turning questions into destinations and seeking direction via the overture—is clear and consistent, but he experiences little real internal conflict or doubt. The “dueling philosopher” concept is strong, yet his emotional life is summarized more than embodied; we don’t feel fear, vanity, or anger under pressure. His mechanical arm and reputation show competence, but he never risks moral compromise or a meaningful mistake. The ending shift toward “newfound direction” is more declared than earned through visible inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poet and Cora are vivid, particular, and their dynamic feels lived-in, with nice touches like her “laugh like breaking glass” and his trembling hands at molt-time. His monthly molting and quiet rebellion give him texture beyond a single-note martyr. However, internal contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the tension between wanting to disappear into a new self and choosing to stay the poet could carry more embodied conflict on the page. The final decision to “keep the poet’s voice” is thematically apt but lands as relatively smooth rather than agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pianist’s longing, indecision, and eventual soft turn toward hope are clear and consistent, with objects (clock, compasses, piano) nicely externalizing his interior state. Motivation—seeking the tidal arbor as refuge and possibility of reconfiguration—is legible and drives his choices. However, his emotional life stays relatively single-note (melancholic, wistful) with limited on-page contradiction or genuine moral friction under pressure. The final choice to play until his fingers bleed feels earned but not deeply stratified in competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to safeguard the island’s memory while remaining rigorously empirical—is clear and consistently enacted, and the empirical/whimsical tension gives him specificity. However, his emotions stay largely at the conceptual level; we get very little embodied unease, fear, or joy as he acts. The internal contradiction (measurement vs belief) is suggested more than dramatized in on-page struggle. The closing doubt is thematically strong but not fully felt as a personal cost in his body or behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s grief and need for understanding are specific and embodied through her tactile engagement with the compass, lace, and tree, and her multi-season apprenticeship and later teaching arc make the internal change feel earned. Hideo is sketched with economical but clear traits—his slow speech, ritual focus, and non-intrusive instruction—and his choices directly shape Mara’s process. The emotional journey from “cerulean regret” to a steadier, reconfigured relationship with memory is credible, if a bit idealized. There is limited on-page contradiction or messiness in Mara’s interiority, which slightly flattens her complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s internal conflict—scientific detachment vs. emotional messiness—is drawn with precision, and her shift is rooted in character-specific observation. However, the epiphany (“She realized her mistake...”) relies on diagnostic interiority rather than dramatized struggle, making the psychological pivot feel slightly rushed and over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous," "steadily adaptive") and stated realizations rather than embodied emotion or conflict. The protagonist's internal state is delivered through therapy-speak ("discover purpose in the pauses") and generic reactions ("quiet resolve") without distinct psychological specificity. Motivation is explicitly told to the reader rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary labels ("stubborn need," "soundless grief") rather than embodied emotion or messy internal struggle. Mara’s mastery of the emotional translation is presented as a completed backstory accomplishment rather than a dramatized process, distancing the reader from her effort.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's "inadvertent stubbornness" is a strong conceptual anchor that pays off in the closure's realization of entrapment. However, agency is diluted in the middle section; the solution to the lens's repair arrives passively via "dreams" rather than through active ingenuity or struggle, slightly dampening the character's competence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies entirely on positive labels ("gently persistent force," "whisper among the weary") rather than dramatized complexity. Mara faces no internal conflict or genuine opposition, functioning as a saintly vehicle for the theme rather than a flawed individual making hard choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist acts as a vessel for spiritual labels ("pilgrim of sparks") rather than a distinct character with contradictory desires. There is no internal conflict or struggle; the character wants healing, seeks it, and finds it immediately without resistance or behavioral flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist’s obsession is clear and consistent, but her interiority is often reported via summary ("She realized," "She understood") rather than dramatized through immediate reaction. While her motivation drives the plot, she functions more as an intellectual vehicle for the concept than a character making difficult, felt choices in a specific moment of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is an archetype ("The Liberator") defined by labels rather than specific, contradictory interiority. His motivation is stated abstractly ("purpose burns bright") and his actions—following an arrow, dancing with chains—lack the friction of genuine human decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyra’s obsession is compelling, and her synesthesia provides unique, embodied interiority that grounds the fantastical premise. The final choice to discard the device earns the resolution via renunciation, though her passivity until the external event (forge reignition) limits agency in the middle build.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lux is defined by labels ("quietly savvy") and abstract desires rather than embodied traits or struggle. She faces no internal contradictions and overcomes obstacles with immediate, convenient solutions, leaving her character arc flat and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek is a vividly drawn, specific protagonist whose internal contradiction—using fire to understand frost, crafting vessels for unanswerable questions—drives the narrative. The performative trait of narrating to the machinery grounds his loneliness without slipping into melodrama. The grief is embodied in action (glassblowing) rather than just internal monologue, meeting the high standard for characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is explicitly summarized ("motivation burned clear") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "ghost of a daughter" appears in the final sentence without prior setup, creating an unearned attempt at emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization is functional but flat, relying on roles rather than depth. The oracle is defined by the label "mildly obsessed" rather than behavior, and the traveler lacks interiority beyond generic "weight." There are no contradictory impulses or meaningful micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (protocol vs. curiosity) is functional but relies on standard "robot discovers soul" tropes without deeper subversion. The transition from janitorial duty to high-stakes philosophical inquiry ("where do thoughts come from?") feels abrupt and driven by the prompt's requirements rather than organic character pressure. The emotional realization at the end is stated in abstract terms ("joy of their endless formation") rather than earned through a visible struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elara is a functional vessel for the plot with no internal contradiction, distinct voice, or active struggle; her "trained eye" is a convenient label rather than a demonstrated skill set. The antagonist's immediate, tearful confession removes all interpersonal pressure, resulting in a resolution without human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.5)
    Silas functions as a fable archetype—the Wise Old Mentor—rather than a living character with internal contradictions or distinct desires. His emotional arc is linear (fear to validation), and his "weariness" feels like a stated trait rather than an embodied struggle affecting his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael is a focused, capable protagonist whose specific trait ("obliging nature") is cleverly used to justify her access to the sensors, creating a nice contrast with her rebellious act of diverting power. The internal motivation is clear and consistent, though the "mechanic vs. scientist" dynamic relies on somewhat standard archetypes. Her reaction to the climax—internal satisfaction over external validation—feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara’s motivation is stated rather than felt, with the "lately inspired" trait applied as a mechanical label three times rather than dramatized through distinct choices. The backstory of the three-year silence is a promising hook left unexplored, leaving her interiority generic and disconnected from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by abstract labels ("fault-tolerant," "swallowed truth") rather than dramatized psychology. The central realization is unearned; she simply decides to feel peace without a credible internal struggle or contradictory impulse acting in the scene. The emotional arc relies on "therapy-speak" diagnostics ("forgiveness she can finally allow herself") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    Motivation is legible, but the "religiously skeptical" trait functions only as a label; it fails to constrain his immediate acceptance of the supernatural mechanics (ghosts, wheel logic). The protagonist experiences no genuine internal conflict before using the magical solution, making his skepticism feel unearned and purely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as a passive observer whose primary trait is defined by labels ("witness," "guardian") rather than dramatized struggle. Motivation is stated directly ("sole motivation was to witness") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices. The final realization feels asserted in summary rather than earned through a confrontation with genuine failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mira functions as a flawless healer archetype without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her actions lack genuine struggle or micro-choices under pressure, as the connection with the patient is instantaneous and magical rather than earned through distinct character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias functions primarily as a vessel for observation rather than a character under pressure; his "oddness" is vindicated immediately without struggle. He lacks internal contradiction or a moment of difficult choice; the "reluctant shepherd" role is accepted without a dramatized emotional cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mei Lin’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing the weight of past guilt with a desire for agency. The motivation to "bleach the future" is distinct and drives the pivot from passive prophet to active conductor effectively. The cost of shedding her identity adds weight to the final choice, though the ease of her transition limits the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Miriam is competent and cool, but static; she functions as a technician of the supernatural rather than a character under pressure. She faces no internal doubt, pays no personal cost, and her victory feels inevitable from the start, lacking the vulnerability or struggle required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined more by labels ("cryptic fortune cookie writer," "chronologically homesick") than by dramatized choice. Her primary struggle—exhaustion—is resolved instantly without a difficult trade-off or visible cost, leaving her interiority summary-heavy and lacking in contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist serves as an abstract vessel for philosophical concepts rather than an embodied character, with emotions labeled ("regrets," "doubt") rather than enacted in scene. Interiority relies on high-level summary and metaphor ("walls made of her adult regrets"), preventing a visceral connection to the stakes or the "gravity defier" as a person.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined by abstract descriptors ("cotton silence") rather than specific behaviors. Her healing is unearned by agency; she acts as a passive vessel for the drum maker's magic, undergoing a profound internal shift without a dramatized struggle or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies on diagnostic labels ("obsessive," "curiously," "resolute") rather than embodied behavior or complex interiority. The protagonist’s internal state is summarized ("steeled his resolve to nurture integrity") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is legible, but characterization relies heavily on label-speak ("wistful lantern broker," "aromatically cautious") rather than organic behavior. The emotional transition from suppression to release feels somewhat performed and melodramatic rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") rather than embodied emotion or behavior. The protagonist is a cipher for the theme, lacking specific internal conflict or idiosyncratic reactions; his "prison escape" backstory is stated but never informs his tactile choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, functioning as a vehicle for the ritual rather than a person making difficult choices. Motivation is asserted through abstract labels ("longs to unbind") rather than dramatized pressure, and emotional beats are summarized ("heart feels the weight") rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions as an observer-narrator; while his profession is clear, his motivation is stated verbatim ("fuse insight with empathy") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The internal conflict between detachment and connection is present but resolves through reflection rather than action. The client is a functional archetype who serves the transaction but lacks distinct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on told traits ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Lena’s motivation shifts instantly from business to sentimental philanthropy without internal conflict or resistance, resulting in a flat, functional arc. The emotional reactions are generic ("heart quickened," "tears welled"), lacking specific embodiment or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Motivation is stated clearly in exposition ("graft himself onto community") rather than dramatized through high-pressure choices. The protagonist's "boldly sympathetic" trait is relegated to a backstory summary, failing to drive a specific, costly decision in the present scene. Emotional progression feels linear and abstract, lacking the internal contradiction required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions as a heroic archetype rather than a psychologically complex character; she lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses, moving from observation to self-sacrifice without a moment of doubt or competing desire. Her interiority is largely functional ("motivation sharpened"), serving the plot rather than revealing a unique, conflicted consciousness. While her agency drives the climax, the absence of struggle makes the ultimate cost feel inevitable rather than chosen against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    Vesper is defined primarily by her sorrow and her occupation, lacking internal contradictions or distinct friction in her choices. Her motivation is stated clearly ("to understand the mathematics of emotion"), but she encounters no hesitation or meaningful internal struggle during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interiority is rich with sensory metaphor, but she lacks the friction of genuine flaws or contradictory impulses; she is a benevolent archetype rather than a specific, struggling individual. The "boy" functions more as a receptive prop than a character with agency, making the connection feel idealized rather than earned through interaction or risk. The desire for "visibility" is stated clearly but the stakes of her anonymity (the cost of being found vs. the need to be seen) are not tested by any close call.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist's internal arc is defined by diagnostic labels ("reluctant metamorphosis," "desire to study") rather than dramatized struggle. The transformation occurs too easily in the first third without contradictory impulses or genuine resistance testing her resolve. Her emotions are summarized in therapeutic language rather than embodied in specific, costly actions.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's emotions are summarized via abstract labels ("haggard awe," "desperation") rather than embodied in action or sensory detail. The trait "wryly earnest" appears only as an adverbial tag rather than a driver of behavior or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.6)
    Lira functions primarily as an observer until the final paragraph; her internal state is described through metaphor rather than embodied emotion ("river of certainty," "stone she had missed"). The pivotal realization ("She understood now") relies on summary rather than dramatized experience, and her motivation is explicitly stated rather than felt through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archivist is functionally competent but lacks internal friction; she performs her task without doubt, risk, or personal cost on the page. The navigator serves more as a passive recipient of healing than an agent with distinct drives, making the character dynamics feel archetypal rather than human.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara is consistent but defined primarily by labels ("analytically artistic") rather than choices under pressure. The emotional core—the estranged brother—arrives only at the very end to force weight, feeling like a convenient hook rather than an integrated drive. The internal conflict ("reason vs. instinct") is stated in summary rather than dramatized through hesitation or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist is defined by contradictory labels (&quot;sympathetic skeptic&quot;) that are immediately negated by action; she accepts the magic legend instantly without the skepticism promised. There is no internal conflict or struggle; Lira performs the plot with perfect competence, lacking human flaw or decision-making weight.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Althea’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, and the central conflict (boredom vs. uncertainty) is legible. However, her interiority relies heavily on high-level abstraction ("deathless core," "suffocating boredom") rather than specific, grounded memories or sensory details that would make her weariness feel earned rather than stated. The emotional stakes are functional but lack the distinct, personal specificity required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sam's internal conflict—honesty versus survival—is compelling, but the voice often reads as implausibly adult for a fourteen-year-old ("ethical algebra," "negotiations with fate"). The shift from a passive observer to a master negotiator is abrupt and feels unearned by the character's established capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined by labels ("earnestly studious") rather than dramatized choices or internal contradictions. She faces no resistance in her ritual, executing tasks with perfect competence, which prevents the emergence of character depth or agency. The emotional landscape is asserted through summary rather than inhabited through specific, costly reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is consistent in his obsession but lacks contradictory impulses or internal conflict; he functions more as a philosophical vessel for the concept than a fully embodied agent under pressure. While the "handwriting" moment offers a glimpse of personal stakes, his reaction remains cerebral and observational rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract philosophizing rather than embodied emotion or concrete micro-choices. Elias functions more as a thematic vessel than a living person; his internal state is described through diagnostic labels ("gloom," "cheer") and metaphors ("second heart") rather than visceral reaction. The transition from myth-buster to myth-maker is a role swap stated in the narration, not a transformation earned through high-stakes struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.4)
    The character is defined entirely by summary labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") rather than dramatized choices. The stated "dual allegiance" never manifests as an internal conflict or difficult choice on the page; she acts purely as a resistance leader without hesitation. The summary mode prevents any access to embodied emotion or micro-reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a competent observer but lacks internal conflict or distinct personality beyond the assigned task. The attribute "purposefully curious" is applied as a label three times rather than dramatized through difficult choices or specific sacrifices. Motivation is clear, but the emotional landscape is largely told through abstract summaries like "the weight of the space age."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.4)
    Miren is a static archetype of the "magical artisan" whose blindness serves as an aesthetic label rather than a genuine constraint. She "watches" spectral lines and light refraction, defying her established limitation without sensory translation (e.g., heat, vibration). She remains statically competent, displaying "magnetic calm" rather than struggling with contradictory impulses or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael functions more as a thematic vessel than a character; his primary trait ("dry wit") is labeled in narration but not demonstrated in dialogue or thought. The internal landscape is replaced by aphorisms, and his surrender to the transformation lacks the requisite struggle or contradictory impulse to give the sacrifice weight.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael functions as an archetypal operator of the magic system rather than a character with interiority; he lacks contradictory impulses or on-page struggle. The "seven hearts" are treated as props (the widow, the cobbler) rather than distinct entities impacting the pressure. The "infinitely patient" trait serves as a label for backstory rather than a driver of an agonizing choice in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lira’s motivation is sharp and her choice to prioritize the mission over survival is clear, though the transition from skeptic to believer in the vial’s power happens via summary rather than dramatized struggle. The internal conflict is articulated ("Instinct screamed") but resolved somewhat quickly to facilitate the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist acts as a procedural vessel for the prompt's ritual rather than a character with conflicting desires or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a passive vehicle for the plot, obeying the ghost's instructions without hesitation, internal conflict, or distinct motivation beyond a generic desire to save the orchard. Her emotional reactions are summarized ("breath hitched," "felt the weight") rather than embodied in difficult choices. The lack of agency prevents any deepening of character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara is a functional archetype rather than a realized character, defined by the label "hauntingly optimistic" rather than embodied traits. She lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, and her actions—sleepwalking and sewing—are driven by fable logic rather than specific, high-stakes decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lina functions as a thematic vessel rather than a character under pressure; her interiority relies on abstract labels ("dread and hope," "quiet tremor of faith") rather than contradictory impulses. The resolution is reached without a difficult choice or personal cost, as the restoration of the sundial heals her trauma through symmetric satisfaction rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael is a clearly defined archetype with a consistent role, but the characterization relies on stated motivation ("never just the fee") rather than desire tested by difficult choices. The execution borders on competence porn; Kael performs the task with "surgical precision" and no internal resistance, resulting in a flat emotional arc without contradictory impulses or embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira functions as an archetype ("wise old woman") rather than a specific individual; her interiority relies on abstract affirmations of her role rather than conflicted, embodied thought. The trait of "foolishness" is stated in exposition but never dramatized in interaction, leaving her without a social dynamic to navigate. Her final choice to leave feels inevitable rather than earned through a struggle between safety and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is largely passive, following Mira's instructions ("Mira told me to... I knelt") rather than driving the action through conflicting desires. The emotional arc is described via abstract labels ("grief," "rage," "denial") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance, making the final release feel procedural rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and the fusion of professional deformation (translation) with personal guilt is compelling. However, the daughter functions more as a symbolic vessel for his regret than a fully realized presence, and the "seventeen years" timeline raises logistical questions about the prop's presence that slightly blur the character's current reality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lyra functions as a vehicle for the prompt's themes rather than a character with agency under pressure. Her journey is frictionless; she encounters no internal doubt or external failure that forces a hard choice. The "joy" she seeks is stated in abstract summaries ("hollow," "fog inside her") rather than dramatized through behavior or costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("methodically playful nature," "motivation was to exchange certainty for curiosity") rather than dramatized behavior or choice. There is no internal contradiction or struggle; Elena sheds her "certainty" without demonstrated friction or cost. The emotional arc is asserted by the narrator rather than felt through the character's reactions to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    Aris functions as a stock "rogue" archetype whose internal landscape lacks contradiction or doubt, relying on labels like "charming smile" rather than demonstrated complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist serves as an allegorical vessel rather than an embodied character; she lacks internal contradiction or specific micro-choices under pressure. The narrative relies on summary descriptions of her state ("centuries of longing") rather than dramatizing her struggle in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is stated via exposition ("dedicated her existence") rather than dramatized through struggle. Lyra's interiority consists of abstract realizations and labeled emotions ("heart... felt the crack") rather than embodied reactions to pressure. She lacks distinct agency, functioning primarily as a vehicle for the prompt's metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's internal motivation is clear, but Kess serves primarily as a plot device who capitulates immediately. The emotional transition from months of silence to "laughing over a table" is unearned and bypasses the necessary friction of genuine reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Alia is defined by her role and skills rather than a distinct internal life; her motivation is an abstract goal ("harmonize conflicting values") stated in the narration rather than felt through pressure. Her emotions are often described via adverbs ("slyly heartfelt") rather than dramatized, and she faces no significant character-defining choice that requires a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is abstract and rooted in nostalgia ("echoes") rather than urgent need. The protagonist's internal state is described through labels ("man reborn," "fragile trust") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The emotional shift feels unearned because the struggle is summarized, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency, functioning as a passive vessel who overcomes abstract obstacles via immediate "intuition" rather than struggle or choice. Emotional states are stated as labels ("heart aches") rather than dramatized through behavior, and the attribute "featherly determined" appears only as a descriptor without influencing action.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Iyana’s internal landscape is vivid, and her motivation to find belonging drives the narrative logic. However, the transition from exile to fatal transformation feels less like a struggle and more like a surrender to inevitable poetic logic; the epiphany resolves the conflict instantly rather than through a series of escalating micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear execution of tasks without hesitation or meaningful cost. Emotions are frequently labeled ("pang of sorrow," "curious joy") rather than dramatized through specific, embodied reactions or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.6)
    Lyra functions as a thematic cipher rather than a fully realized character; she lacks distinct personality traits, internal contradictions, or a unique voice.

The narrative relies on summarizing her understanding ("She understood that to fledge...") rather than dramatizing the psychological process of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for abstract philosophy rather than a grounded character; motivation is explicitly stated ("illuminate value in the mundane") rather than dramatized through pressure.

The transition to teacher in the final paragraph feels unearned by the prior lack of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's internal state is consistent, but her psychology is rendered through abstract labels ("bargained her innocence," "survive surviving") rather than embodied reactions. The emotional arc feels therapeutic and predetermined rather than a raw, unfolding struggle under pressure. While the survivor archetype is clear, the realization at the end feels intellectualized rather than earned through immediate dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael is a competent focalizer, but she lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle; she functions primarily as a vessel for the concept. The climax relies on "fingers moved automatically," which undermines protagonist agency in the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the repeated label "sensitively perceptive" rather than enacted complexity or distinctive interiority. Her emotional arc—from observer to activist—is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character; her "chastity" is a label that generates no friction in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Adrian is a distinct, urbane presence, and his motivation is clear, though primarily expository ("quiet obsession"). His interiority is stable, but he functions more as a catalyst for the audience than a protagonist undergoing high-stakes internal conflict himself; he ends the story largely unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Esme functions primarily as a thematic vessel; her motivation is clear but stated via label ("esoteric realist") rather than dramatized through distinct, messy humanity. While her dedication is evident, her interiority feels abstract and diagnostic ("knew the mathematics of loss") rather than embodied in visceral reaction. She lacks an internal counter-pressure or doubt that would make her persistence feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The character's transition from shame to purpose feels unearned, relying on a convenient epiphany rather than struggle. The attribute "technically gentle" is applied as a repetitive label (an epithet) rather than demonstrated through complex action. The emotional arc is linear and lacks the internal contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s internal landscape is rich, but her pivotal transformation is passive; she receives a full explanation of her purpose and the solution to her conflict from a dream figure rather than earning it through struggle. The shift from "preservation" to "transcendence" relies on this external instruction, weakening her agency at the climax. The "foresight through hindsight" trait is well-established but ultimately abandoned rather than utilized to solve the final problem.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael is a consistent focalizer with a clear worldview, but his defining trait of "frugality" feels asserted via labels rather than dramatized through a high-cost choice under pressure. The characterization is competent but lacks the visceral interior contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.7)

The emotional arc is smooth and lacks the struggle or error required for deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Evers’s transition from bewilderment to acceptance forms a clear, complete arc. The motivation (curiosity overriding duty) is consistent, though the pivotal shift in the bathroom relies heavily on a sudden epiphany rather than a pressured decision between distinct options. The "mourner" role at the end adds necessary depth and specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.4)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions as a static archetype rather than a conflicted protagonist; her "teaching" comes without personal risk or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elena acts as a vessel for the story's philosophy rather than a living protagonist; her motivation ("to discover the mathematics of mercy") feels authorial and abstract rather than visceral or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but the internal conflict relies on a convenient conflation of "self-doubt" with "lying" to trigger the magic system, which feels like a mechanical necessity rather than genuine character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Wick's emotional arc is legible and touching, but the characterization relies on heavy anthropomorphism that grants him human-level abstract reasoning ("parsing syntax," solving riddles).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined by the "blessed pariah" label rather than demonstrated social reality or psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("historian of small gestures") rather than dramatized behavior. The "crisis actor" trait colors the narration but does not distinctively shape his tactics or choices under pressure. The protagonist lacks internal conflict; his "benevolently ruthless" trait is stated in exposition but contradicted by his purely benevolent actions.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is asserted via somatic shorthand ("thrummed beneath her ribs") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. The protagonist's competence is convenient; the raven feather appears from her pocket with a summarized backstory explanation exactly when the plot requires it, rather than being an established asset. Internal conflict is resolved through summary ("desire... outweighed the fear") rather than a visceral on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—redemption for a past fatal blunder—is clear, but the emotional trajectory is linear and lacks genuine internal friction; he moves from guilt to resolve without a significant on-page struggle. The "young girl" functions as a convenient prop for his redemption rather than an autonomous character, and the "fierce repose" label substitutes for dramatized emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael functions as an archetype rather than a complex character, defined by the repeated label "innocently mischievous" rather than contradictory desires or embodied cost. The antagonist Elders offer no genuine resistance, and Mara serves primarily as a philosophical sounding board, leaving the protagonist’s internal landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, effectively reframing her defining trait ("uncertainty") from a flaw into a discipline that enables her survival. Her internal drive to "conjure meaning" aligns perfectly with her actions under pressure, creating a cohesive and purposeful protagonist. The transformation at the end feels earned by her persistence through the escalating physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on romanticized labels ("nostalgic quay painter") rather than behavior. The protagonist's internal state is described through abstract purple prose ("haunted by salt-laden breezes") rather than dramatized through specific, conflicted choices. The emotional arc is linear and unearned, resolving a decade of grief with a single convenient painting session.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, and her motivation is consistent. Marcus serves effectively as an antagonist-turned-partner, though his emotional pivot feels slightly rapid, relying heavily on the magical realism element ("vibrations") rather than a purely psychological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael functions as a plot vehicle rather than a complex character; his motivation is linear (miss sister -> build machine) without internal contradiction or reluctance. The emotional arc relies on stated grief ("memory of his sister's laughter") rather than dramatized, specific memory or behavioral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies on label-speak ("rational truffle forager," "cultivate psychological safety") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's "rational" nature disappears immediately upon finding the artifact, and the motivation is stated as an abstract concept rather than a felt drive.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cornelius is a distinct, if slightly archetypal, focalizer whose internal landscape matches the story's mood. However, his epiphany is swift and relies heavily on abstract introspection rather than a pressured trade-off. The emotional resolution feels somewhat unearned, pivoting on a sudden realization rather than a struggle with the ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Merrick’s internal conflict between regret and the courage to act is palpable, effectively anchoring the magical realism in emotional truth. The decision to leave his life behind feels earned by the established backstory, though the specific trait "empirically intuitive" relies on repeated telling rather than organic integration into his personality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetype than a specific consciousness; her "disenchantment" facilitates an easy surrender to destiny without the internal friction of a difficult choice. The lack of contradictory impulses makes the climax feel inevitable rather than earned, as the renunciation of the crown she already despises carries little emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by labels and abstract desires ("motivation thrummed... to capture the density of presence") rather than embodied traits or contradictions. Interiority relies on stated feelings ("feeling the directed spontaneity") rather than psychological texture. The characters face no internal conflict or blind spots; they are competent archetypes performing a ritual without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Internal motivation ("distill chaos") is clear, but the emotional pivot—using jealousy as fuel for flight—feels mechanical and dictated by the prompt rather than organic character psychology. The protagonist's struggle remains largely abstract and cerebral, lacking embodied reactions to the "feral" threat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation is distinct and poignant, but her internal journey relies too heavily on diagnostic summary ("trying to map emotional terrain") rather than embodied struggle. The shift in perspective is catalyzed almost entirely by the mentor's lecture, rendering the protagonist somewhat passive in her own epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("budding rune scholar," "youthful superstitions") rather than demonstrated traits. The emotional arc is linear and lacks internal contradiction; the protagonist moves from anxiety to peace without a defining choice or sacrifice that tests her values. The resolution feels unearned, as the "fear dissolves" simply because the ritual is performed, bypassing genuine psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira's motivation is clear, but Linden's rapid transition from hostility to forgiveness feels unearned, treating him more as a lock to be opened than a character with genuine resistance. The emotional progression relies on the perfume's effect rather than interpersonal dynamics, reducing the complexity of the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist functions more as a metaphysical cipher than an embodied character; interiority consists largely of abstract realizations rather than specific, grounded emotion. While the renunciation of self at the end is a clear choice, the lack of human struggle or contradictory impulses makes the "witness" feel like a vehicle for the concept. The transition from observer to participant is driven by prompt-required realizations rather than organic character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is abstractly stated ("unlock a question") rather than embodied in pressurized choice. Interiority relies heavily on filter verbs ("imagined," "wondered," "felt") instead of contradictory impulses, creating a distance that prevents genuine engagement. The protagonist lacks a specific flaw or internal conflict, functioning merely as a vessel for the story's thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael is a coherent focalizer with consistent internal logic, though the emotional pivot from security specialist to "guardian of grief" feels swift and slightly sentimental. The "spatially gifted" trait functions more as a repeated label for perception than a driver of complex, difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("probability professor," "compulsive gambler") and abstract interiority rather than embodied emotion. Lila's grief is processed through tidy metaphors ("silence that echoed louder"), and her motivation is stated explicitly rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character motivation is explicitly stated ("to teach endings how to begin") rather than dramatized through subtext or resistance. Interiority relies on stock metaphors ("heart, long frozen, thawed," "locked vault") and summary, preventing specific, embodied emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.4)
    The protagonist lacks specific interiority or agency, serving merely as a vessel for prompt terms. Emotions are delivered via repeated diagnostic labels ("haunted euphoria") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies entirely on summary and labels ("desperately jocular") rather than dramatized behavior or interiority. There are no on-page micro-choices or embodied emotions; the protagonist acts through high-level narrated intent without visible struggle or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elara’s sensory interiority is vivid, successfully grounding the blind perspective. However, her journey lacks active agency; the compass "pulls" her and she simply follows, removing the need for difficult micro-choices or trade-offs under pressure. The emotional resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael is defined by labels ("confidently uncertain") rather than dramatized internal conflict; his acceptance of the pen's loss comes too easily. The emotional arc lacks resistance, moving smoothly from power to peace without a crucible that tests his character.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    Elias is passive; his internal shift is guided entirely by the advisor rather than forged through resistance or difficult choice. The emotion relies on abstract labels ("slow erosion of memory") rather than embodied, specific interiority. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.5)
    Internal conflict is summarized via labels ("guilt," "fury") rather than dramatized through specific choices under pressure. The protagonist's transformation from arsonist to librarian occurs in a montage spanning weeks, preventing access to the moment of decision. The "analytically intuitive" trait functions as a convenient shortcut for problem-solving rather than a character-specific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving the narrative from the opening stasis to the transformative climax. The internalization of the "guinea pig" status and its rejection through the "quiet rebellion" adds depth, though the connection to Mira relies slightly on established tropes of lost love. His agency is absolute in the final beat, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marek is a competent, active protagonist with distinct skills, but he functions as a static archetype who faces no internal doubt or genuine cost. The "competence porn" dynamic means he executes a plan perfectly without emotional struggle or character growth, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("silent empathy," "unspoken fears") rather than dramatized behavior. The Guardian functions as a magical plot device without internal conflict or distinct personality beyond the archetype. The child is a passive vessel for the lesson, lacking agency until the final mimicry.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist functions as a benevolent archetype rather than a living character; he lacks internal conflict, flaws, or contradictory impulses. His motivation is purely altruistic and meets no internal resistance, resulting in a flat trajectory where his choices cost him nothing emotionally or personally.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is summarized in backstory ("fortress of duty") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the protagonist’s path to self-acceptance encounters no genuine internal resistance. The resolution feels like a gift of destiny rather than an earned transformation, as the "duty" side of the conflict vanishes without a fight.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the premise but lacks specific, embodied interiority beyond prompt labels. Emotions are summarized ("grief pooled like dark water") rather than dramatized through unique reactions, and the "moral ambiguity" is stated as a trait rather than felt through an agonizing on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.3)
    The protagonist is an abstract vessel defined by stated labels ("aesthetically driven") rather than dramatized choices or resistance. There is no internal conflict or distinct personality; she moves through the scene as a passive observer rather than an agent making high-stakes decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characters function as thematic avatars rather than psychological entities; Elara’s "innocently cunning" nature is declared via label but never tested by a difficult choice. There is no friction or internal contradiction, resulting in a fable-like flatness where reactions are dictated by the moral rather than human impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kaelen’s internal drive is well-rendered, anchoring her obsession with sound in personal history (the grandfather’s lens). However, Mara functions primarily as a rhetorical foil rather than a fully realized character; her shift from skepticism to awe is rapid and convenient, serving the theme more than organic psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions more as a thematic archetype than a living character; her grief is described through high-level summary rather than dramatized micro-reactions. The reliance on "she understood" and "she saw" filters interiority through narrator abstraction, denying the reader access to her raw, embodied experience during the critical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara serves as a competent vehicle for the premise, but her interiority feels somewhat functional, existing primarily to articulate the thematic thesis. The recurring tag "steadily curious" acts as a label rather than a demonstrated trait that forces difficult choices under pressure. The architect functions largely as a symbolic prop for the old regime, lacking individual texture beyond his trembling hands and suit.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined solely by the prompt's requirements. Her motivation ("personal loss") is abstract backstory told in summary rather than a specific, embodied wound. Internal conflict is labeled ("anguished joy") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is functional but defined by abstract labels ("quiet attention," "subtle vigilance") rather than embodied traits. The "cost" of the resolution is stated retrospectively in narration ("cost of a piece of oneself") rather than dramatized as a difficult choice in the moment, reducing emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s internal state is well-dramatized through the physical actions of cleaning and care; the "weight of shame" translates effectively into the trembling of her hands. Her motivation to pivot from fraud to genuine conservation is earned beat-by-beat. The final choice to face the officer while fiercely protecting her charge demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("a closure seeker") rather than dramatized choice or struggle. Her internal state is summarized through exposition ("motivation tonight was to learn") rather than enacted, and she reaches her goal without facing contradictory impulses or paying a personal cost. The emotional arc is linear and frictionless, lacking the requisite psychological depth for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose motivation is grounded in a specific, tangible goal reinforced by the looming demolition. The inclusion of the backstory with Elena effectively anchors the metaphysical concept of "unused love" in a personal, felt cost, elevating her beyond a mere functional vessel. Her internal landscape feels coherent, though the repeated labeling of her specific attribute occasionally distances the reader from her immediate interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, lacking specific interiority or contradiction; her emotions are conveyed through abstract metaphors ("ink run dry") rather than embodied feeling. The resolution is entirely passive—she is "fixed" by the universe while she sleeps—violating the requirement for active agency and decision-making at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The guard acts as a functional archetype rather than a nuanced character, serving the fable-like plot efficiently but lacking deep internal contradiction. The cost of the final sacrifice is described through abstract intensity ("unbearable light") rather than a specific, weighed trade-off, making the emotional price feel stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a cipher for philosophical concepts rather than a realized character; there are no contradictory impulses or micro-choices with legible cost. Motivation is stated ("to rediscover the wild frontier") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the "stray philosopher" archetype faces no genuine internal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.3)
    Character emotion is conveyed through abstract labels ("weight of a silence," "unused courage") rather than embodied action or friction. The protagonist's internal shift is unearned, resulting from wise figures dispensing platitudes rather than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, effectively linking her physical nerve regeneration to her moral rehabilitation. The choice to report the stain is well-earned by the pressure of her past failure. However, the backstory detail of a splinter going "through her own spinal cord" clashes with her ability to climb stairs daily, creating a distraction regarding medical credibility despite the sci-fi context.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.3)
    Sylvar and Vael function as archetypes (Guardian vs. Usurper) rather than complex characters. Neither possesses internal conflict or contradictory impulses; Sylvar's "regally unpretentious" nature is a static label, and Vael is a "hollow echo" without agency beyond walking into a trap.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lina serves primarily as a passive observer ("witness") rather than an active agent under pressure. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("silent scream," "ghost") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. While the motivation to solve the puzzle is clear, she faces no difficult choices or meaningful costs in pursuing it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kai is consistent, but her motivation ("waiting for meaning") remains abstract rather than visceral. The required trait "awkward confidence" appears as a label rather than being dramatized through a difficult choice or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara is a coherent protagonist with a clear voice, but her internal struggle is largely resolved before the scene begins. The "insurgent" aspect feels low-stakes because her confidence is absolute and the emotional cost of her rebellion is muted by the lack of hesitation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the prompt's requirements, lacking genuine internal contradiction or resistance to the healing process. The interaction with the curator acts as a didactic guide rather than a relational crucible, and the resolution is achieved without a difficult, character-defining choice that carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—abandoning the "luminous surfaces" for "necessary darkness"—creates a compelling arc that drives the resolution. However, her sudden realization of how to "redesign fate" relies on a knowledge leap rather than a dramatized discovery derived from her character traits. While her artist hands serve as the tool for resolution, the motivation to "untangle threads" feels imposed by the plot's dream logic rather than arising inevitably from her established psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on oxymoronic labels ("consciously wild," "serene anger") repeated verbatim rather than demonstrated through distinct behavior. The protagonist’s motivation to destroy his only companion feels like a sudden plot device rather than a decision rooted in established traits or desperation. Emotional states are summarized with abstract adjectives instead of being embodied in physical reaction or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her internal conflict is articulated through labels ("bravely conflicted") rather than dramatized impulse. The emotional reaction to the climax feels rushed, shifting from treasonous terror to satisfaction ("womb") without earning the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.3)
    Lyra is defined by labels ("pacifist," "senselessly perceptive") rather than choices under pressure; her pacifism is never tested by a genuine threat that would make non-violence costly or difficult. The "perceptive" trait is asserted via narration rather than demonstrated through unique, character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avery’s motivation—grief disguised as a fisher’s cool-headedness—is consistent, and her choice to release the echo is an earned moment of closure. However, the trait "cool-headed" relies on repetitive labeling (four mentions) rather than varied dramatization, and her internal state feels slightly static until the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Victoria is a distinct, well-motivated protagonist whose internal conflict (loyalty vs. truth) drives the narrative. Her trait of being "devotedly observant" is dramatized effectively through her investigation, not just stated. The connection between her father's tools and her choice to dismantle his silence is a strong character beat, though the explicit thematic summary in the final paragraph slightly flattens her autonomy into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a distinct, evocative protagonist whose guilt clearly drives the narrative. However, her agency is somewhat mitigated because she executes a set of instructions from a future self rather than navigating a complex moral choice in the present moment; the decision to act seems pre-made, reducing on-page internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined entirely by the prompt's labels ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") rather than embodied behavior or internal contradiction. Attributing social perceptiveness to her fingers ("read the silence like braille") is a category error that strains credibility. She lacks genuine agency or struggle, functioning merely as a magical artisan who executes a set of instructions without personal cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies entirely on repeated epithets ("gentle radical," "arms of steel") rather than demonstrated behavior or specific interiority. Arin lacks internal contradiction or struggle; he functions solely as a delivery mechanism for the renaming plot without distinct, embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ghost's pivot from a selfish "hunger for one more ovation" to the altruistic act of giving his encore away happens without visible struggle or cost. The "cost" is described as a smile and a sense of fulfillment, which reads as a reward rather than a price paid. The actress functions as a passive vessel for the ghost's agency rather than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on the repeated telling of the label "affectionate skeptic" rather than dramatizing the trait through complex behavior. Interiority is summary-based ("skepticism deepened," "curiosity and caution") and lacks embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The protagonist functions as a procedural vessel for the prompt elements without genuine psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lira functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she encounters no resistance and makes no difficult choices under pressure. Her interiority consists of abstract thematic musings ("turn emotion into topography") rather than specific, embodied psychological states or contradictory impulses. The character lacks a defined flaw or struggle, resulting in a flat trajectory where enlightenment is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype in a fable rather than a fully realized character in a short story; her internal shift is summarized ("began to understand") rather than dramatized in a specific moment of crisis. There is no on-page contradictory impulse or struggle, making the final stance feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kael's motivation is consistent and drives the scene, but his interiority relies heavily on summary and retrospective framing ("exile had taught him patience") rather than active contradiction in the moment. The emotional arc is resolved through external validation (the courier's news) rather than a difficult on-page choice, resulting in a functional but somewhat static character portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    Silas is less a character than a vessel for abstract themes; his motivation ("to distill complexity") is stated as a philosophical thesis rather than embodied desire. The emotional weight relies on labeled concepts ("palimpsest promise") rather than dramatized interiority. While the "yarn needle" habit attempts to add texture, it feels symbolic rather than lived-in, and his dialogue ("I distilled everything") reads as artificial authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai serves as a vessel for the theme rather than a fully realized agent; her motivation is explicitly stated ("hummed beneath her ribs") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The emotional arc is linear, and her "patience" reads as an assigned trait rather than a behavior tested by genuine pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya functions as a thematic vessel rather than a living character; her internal landscape is entirely composed of abstract metaphors ("silence that trembled like a struck bell") rather than embodied emotion or contradiction. There is no internal conflict or hesitation; she moves from the inciting incident to the resolution with perfect, uncomplicated competence, lacking the friction or flaws that define high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated in abstract terms ("yearns to translate isolation into independence") rather than dramatized through friction. Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("brittle awakening," "resilient truth") instead of embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The character reads more as a vessel for the theme than a living presence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic labels ("inevitably whimsical rhythm," "keeper of secrets") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Lira lacks internal contradiction or agency; she drifts from impulse to success without obstacle, making her a vehicle for the theme rather than a realized protagonist. The "chest of borrowed sorrows" is an abstract metaphor that never manifests as a felt weight or constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is a competent and driven protagonist, though her defining trait, &quot;cautiously hopeful,&quot; relies heavily on labeling rather than purely organic demonstration. Her internal conflict is legible, but the &quot;power plays&quot; with rivals are delivered via summary rather than dramatized interaction, distancing the reader from her immediate social pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies on abstract labels ("claustrophobic wanderer," "prudently adventurous") rather than embodied reaction; the phobia is stated but resolved instantly by the compass without forcing a choice or creating genuine inhibition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's internal conflict (apathy vs. empathy) is clear, but the resolution feels unearned and rushed. The transition from "empathy died five years prior" to "It had been there all along" relies on stated interiority rather than dramatized emotional progression. The breakthrough moment ("lancing the wound of her own apathy") reads as melodramatic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    The librarian's motivation is clear and drives the narrative, but her internal state relies heavily on repetitive "label-speak" ("nervously confident" appears three times). While the central choice to override protocols demonstrates agency, the characterization feels flattened by these inserted prompt tags rather than fully embodied behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is abstract ("to sculpt possibility") rather than concrete, leading to a lack of grounded desire. The trait "dynamically observant" is asserted as a label to justify a plot convenience (wind code) rather than demonstrated through natural behavioral detail. Emotion is handled via repeated prompt phrases ("luminous disbelief") instead of embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by the repetitive label "polished calm" rather than embodied interiority or struggle. Leo functions as a plot device who capitulates instantly to a symbolic gesture, rendering the emotional turning point unearned and lacking in genuine interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s internal state is clearly drawn, and the shift from scholarly ambition to empathetic duty is legible. However, the pivotal realization comes relatively easily through a vision rather than a high-pressure choice between conflicting values; the cost is described ("trembling hands") rather than dramatized through a difficult tradeoff or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist relies on labeled states like "guarded" and "warlike serenity" rather than dramatized interiority. The emotional climax is summarized ("weight... dissolved") rather than felt, resulting in a resolution that lacks psychological cost or earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation") rather than embodied action or difficult choices. Elara's internal state is summarized through poetic metaphor instead of dramatized reaction, and her compliance with the ancestor's instructions reduces her agency to zero.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to restore her sister is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on the repeated tags "reckless idealist" and "fiercely gentle" rather than dramatized complexity. While the sacrifice is a significant choice, the emotional interiority feels constrained by these recurrent labels.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.6)
    Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("insulating herself," "hollow," "nostalgia") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The protagonist's transition from despair to hope is smooth and linear, lacking the psychological resistance or regression that characterizes genuine struggle. The epiphany feels unearned, a sudden switch in mindset rather than a hard-won emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara is clearly drawn, but her internal conflict is resolved through intellectual realization rather than a high-stakes choice between contradictory impulses. The trait "kindly methodical" is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through a moment where she must suppress a desire to be unkind or chaotic. Her success feels inevitable due to competence without a crippling blind spot or character flaw impeding progress.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara is physically distinct, with the "creaking" gears and "tidal memory" grounding her hybrid nature effectively. However, her interiority relies on diagnostic label-speak ("parse into binary," "protocols") rather than fully dramatized struggle, and the shift from machine-logic to rebellion feels slightly smooth without enough jagged hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mara’s background (grandmother’s craft) provides a nice tether for her actions, but the pivot from safety inspector to mystical ritualist feels sudden. The internal struggle during the "heartbeat of a hesitation" is minimal; the leap to using the cave as a magical amplifier feels more like a plot requirement than a character-driven choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("truth-seeking river chronicler," "daringly methodical") rather than demonstrated traits. Internal conflict is summarized through metaphor rather than enacted via difficult choices or embodied emotion. The decision to stop medication is stated but functions largely as a sensory filter rather than a source of genuine behavioral instability or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a passive cipher defined by prompt labels ("veiled dreamer") rather than embodied traits or desires. She navigates the plot by following instructions from letters and maps without exercising agency, manifesting no internal conflict or personal cost in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lira's motivation is clear, but her agency is undercut by reliance on external guidance (plant telepathy, coffee stains) to make decisions rather than internal deliberation or competence. The antagonist (Envoy) is a cardboard obstacle who offers no genuine pressure, accepting a fragile lie without pushback, which flattens the protagonist's triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara is a competent professional, but the narrative lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her choices are purely technical (synchronizing, not touching), demonstrating skill rather than character-defining struggle or moral cost. She functions as a vessel for the process rather than a dynamic protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara is well-defined as a caretaker, but the internal arc relies on expository summary ("Now, at sixty winters, Elara understood...") rather than dramatized struggle. The usage of the required attribute ("felt her kindly decisive nature rising") appears as a diagnostic label during a pivotal beat, which distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an abstract archetype whose motivation is stated ("desire to shed black-and-white judgments") rather than dramatized through friction. The paradox of "sincerely insincere" exists only as a label and does not drive contradictory choices or behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions more as a symbolic vehicle for the premise than a living character; her internal conflict regarding memory loss is summarized ("a sacrifice she accepted") rather than dramatized. The emotional arc feels predetermined, lacking the friction of contradictory impulses or hesitation in the face of vanishing. Motivation is abstract and philosophical, devoid of immediate, visceral want or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist has a clear singular motivation, but she functions as an archetype without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her success requires no difficult choice or sacrifice, resulting in a flat character arc despite the vivid role.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vorrin is a consistent, well-realized protagonist whose internal conflict drives the narrative. However, the story relies on exposition ("Vorrin's motivation was simple...") and labels ("underachiever") to define him rather than solely dramatizing these traits through action early on.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a vessel for synesthetic description rather than a character with agency or struggle. His obsession is stated as a trait ("obsession was to discover") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or sacrifices. The emotional arc is flat; he wants something, goes to get it, and receives it without internal conflict or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("doubt pooled in her sternum like dark matter") rather than embodied sensation. The attribute "quietly enthusiastic" is inserted as a descriptor ("traced the words with quietly enthusiastic reverence") rather than dramatized through behavior, creating tonal dissonance with her desperate situation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is compelling, and the final choice to carry the mirror earns the closure. However, the recurring epithet "heartbroken reaper" relies on labeling rather than dramatizing the specific texture of that grief in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on repeated diagnostic labels ("lukewarm," "brittle," "naive") rather than demonstrated traits. Kael does not face a micro-choice under pressure; he simply performs a procedural ritual without internal contradiction or error. The "brittle devotion" is stated but never tested by a tempting alternative or a moment of failure. The emotional arc is summarized rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.8)
    Nora is a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a realized character; the trait "precisely humane" appears only as a label and does not inform her choices or actions. Her reaction to the discovery is immediate, frictionless resolve, lacking the internal conflict or emotional processing that would make her motivation credible. She operates without a distinct personality, serving merely to move the narrative from discovery to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear, but her internal state is delivered through summary and labels ("secretly sentimental") rather than dramatized micro-choices. The emotional arc resolves too smoothly; the epiphany is intellectual and instantaneous, lacking the friction of genuine internal conflict or doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("watcher," "pattern seeker") rather than specific, embodied personality. Internal conflict is absent; he feels the "burden" because the text says so, not because of a dramatized struggle between competing values. The reliance on "muscle memory" contradicts the attribute of being "attentively inventive."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between the "void" of ego death and the "ghost" of emotion is compelling and well-dramatized. The transition from numbness to grief is earned through the specific action of the climax, though the "gift" that slices pretense feels slightly convenient as a trait. The emotional cost—the "tanto blade" of grief—is visceral and effectively embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies almost exclusively on assertive labels ("notably receptive," "patience... cultivated") rather than demonstrated behavior. Mara lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she simply executes the prompt's requirements without hesitation or cost. The emotional landscape is generic reverence, devoid of the specific, embodied reactions required for high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is poignant and clearly dramatized, anchored by the specific, quirky backstory of the "leaf blower symphony." Her internal state ("mournfully eager") is embodied well in action. However, the emotional landscape occasionally leans into melodramatic interiority ("spectral heart a bruised fruit") rather than trusting the action to convey the depth of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation (shifting from guarding to acceptance) is legible, but the "feral" attribute contradicts the character's highly abstract, philosophical interiority. The guardian feels less like a physical creature and more like a disembodied intellect, creating a dissonance that weakens emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's internal conflict between the inherited label of "hopeless" and her persistence is well-dramatized. The shift from desperation to the "peace of the incomplete" provides a satisfying arc. The prompt attribute ("stoically sensitive") is introduced with a direct label, but the subsequent description ("pressure behind her eyes while her face remained calm") effectively embodies it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s internal pivot is expertly dramatized; the transition from technician to intuitive listener is earned through the physical action of stripping the machine. Her motivation is palpable, rooted in a specific professional identity ("last of her kind") that heightens the stakes of her failure and subsequent breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies almost exclusively on the repeated label "resiliently positive" rather than dramatized resilience through difficult choices. Lina lacks internal contradiction or distinctive interiority; her actions are procedural (tuning a radio, holding a glass) rather than revealing of personality under pressure. The emotional landscape is flattened by this reliance on telling traits.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s internal drive connects directly to the magic system, and her shift from controller to witness creates a distinct, earned arc. While her "fever" remains somewhat abstract until the climax, her motivation creates coherent pressure that forces the central error and subsequent realization.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara’s motivation is clear and the internal conflict between obsolete starlight and benthic reality is compelling. However, the interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel") rather than embodied emotion, particularly in pivotal moments, which creates a distance between reader and character.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is delivered through diagnostic label-speak ("My motivation surges") rather than embodied action. The transition from ghost-listener to rescuer feels mechanical, driven by prompt compliance rather than internal coherence. The protagonist lacks a distinct internal life beyond the functional role of the "contact tracer."

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is compelling and drives the narrative pressure, anchoring the abstract goal of "witnessing" in visceral physical cost ("closing fists," "primal panic"). The internal conflict between phobia and duty is well-sustained and pays off in the decision to endure the final seven seconds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal landscape is described through abstract metaphors rather than contradictory impulses. While her motivation is clear, her emotional journey feels summarized ("She realized," "She understood") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or behavior that resists the plot's linear healing trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychologically grounded character, fitting the fable mode but limiting intimacy. While her motivation is clear, her internal landscape is static; she moves from desire to action without contradictory impulses or hesitation, making her more of a vessel for the concept than a living agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.4)
    Characterization relies entirely on abstract labels ("bitterness," "hope") rather than dramatized internal conflict or specific behavior. Lyn's motivation is stated in summary but never tested against resistance; she simply accepts the magical transformation without a credible human struggle or decision process. The emotional arc is flattened by diagnostic language ("sifted soil... feeling the gravitational pull of its history").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara displays clear agency and motivation, driving the plot through active choices rather than observation. The decision to "become the rhythm" creates a strong moment of risk and internal commitment, though her internal landscape is slightly archetypal for the fable genre.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is defined by the oxymoronic label "respectfully rebellious" rather than through dramatized choices under pressure. His motivation relies heavily on a backstory summary about a dead daughter rather than a present-tense struggle or cost. The emotional beat with the mother feels generic and lacks specific, earned interiority for the mailman.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.2)
    Silas is an archetype defined by labels rather than a fully realized character with internal contradictions. His motivation is stated abstractly ("silence was not emptiness") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and his shift from silence to song lacks earned emotional pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    The librarian functions as a vehicle for the setting rather than a realized character; her "sanely eccentric" trait is an expositional label (told, not shown). There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse, and the young man serves as a convenient prop rather than a source of interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    The librarian functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character. Her interiority is composed almost entirely of thematic metaphors ("cipher of longing," "hollow pulse") rather than embodied emotion or specific human reaction. She obeys the instructions of the "cipher" rather than driving the plot through difficult, character-specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Merrin is characterized largely through labels ("enigmatic," "bold") rather than behavior that contradicts or complicates these traits. While her "quiet that heard too much" is a strong image, her internal state is asserted via summary ("improbable longing") rather than dramatized through high-pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    Elias functions primarily as a procedural vessel for the plot rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The pivotal action—cultivating the mushroom—is handled in a weeks-long summary, denying the reader access to his internal struggle or embodied emotion during the crisis. The realization about the faeries feels like a convenient wrap-up rather than a psychological shift earned through dramatized interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("Lin is the reason") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the "combative tenderness" is applied as a label rather than enacted. The choice to stay is pivotal, but the archivist's interiority relies on stock phrases ("bend, not break") rather than specific, embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.4)
    Vespera functions as a mythic archetype defined by labels ("insatiably creative") rather than a psychological entity; the narrative summarizes her struggle rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses or difficult micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s internal landscape is rich, and her motivation—guilt over the "silence of her failure"—is poignantly dramatized through the physical act of unraveling. The choice to use a "forbidden" method effectively signals agency and desperation. The emotional cost is visceral (voice cracking, reliving the trauma), though the mentor figure feels like a convenient device to establish stakes rather than a felt presence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.9)
    Characterization relies entirely on repeated labels ("methodical curiosity," "perceptive") rather than dramatized choice or internal conflict. Elena is a functional vehicle for the plot with no distinct interiority or embodied emotion. There is no cost to her actions, and she undergoes no earned transformation beyond a stated shift in mood.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cassian is a consistent, coherent focalizer who enacts his "quietly analytic" trait well, but his interiority feels intellectualized to the point of emotional detachment. The struggle remains abstract ("physics of letting go") rather than visceral, resulting in a protagonist who functions more as a vehicle for the story's thesis than a living person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.8)
    The balladeer functions as an archetypal avatar rather than a character with interiority; she lacks contradictory impulses or distinct personality traits beyond the prompt’s requirements. The introduction of the scribe late in the text splits the focus without deepening the psychological stakes, leaving both figures as flat vehicles for the plot. No meaningful choice or sacrifice is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kai is a passive observer whose primary action ("On impulse, Kai lifted the brass-rimmed goggles") is a whim rather than a high-stakes decision. The motivation ("curiosity that bordered on devotion") and emotional state ("affectionate detachment") are stated as summary labels rather than dramatized through difficult choices or contradictions. The character serves as a vessel for the revelation rather than an active agent driving the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is a distinct, intellectually driven protagonist with a clear obsession. However, her visceral reaction to the life-threatening crash is muted by philosophical detachment, making her feel slightly like a thematic vessel rather than a fully embodied survivor.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kael is a functional archetype, but his face blindness is treated as a magical quirk solved by the coin rather than a disability forcing tactical struggle. Internal state relies on abstract awe ("soul," "universe") rather than specific, grounded emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies heavily on explicit labels ("diligently curious," "obsessively") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Elara faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a straight line of competence without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist acts as a functional archetype rather than a character, lacking internal contradiction, distinct voice, or genuine struggle. Her journey is a procession of uncontested successes, and the "rhythm of repair" motivation remains an abstract label rather than a felt drive tested by hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.8)
    The collective "they" POV lacks distinct interiority, conflicting impulses, or individual agency. Characters are defined by abstract labels ("strangers become family") rather than specific, embodied choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a vessel for the ritual rather than a fully realized character. The defining trait ("beautifully flawed") is repeated four times as a label but never dramatized through a specific limitation or error that complicates the plot. Internal conflict is asserted via exposition rather than felt through difficult on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s internal conflict—resentment warring with inherited duty—is clearly drawn and embodied in the "offhandedly exact" physical actions. While her reluctance is established, the transition to perfect competence is swift; seeing her falter or nearly choose inaction would have deepened the characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.4)
    The protagonist's traits feel like labels ("symphonically minded") rather than drivers of behavior, and the grief is described with melodrama ("chambers of her heart") rather than embodied action. The emotional arc resolves too neatly, lacking the complexity or resistance of genuine human psychology under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist's internal state (the healer who remains wounded) is clear but static; her choice to remain "unincised" is a backstory premise rather than a struggle dramatized in the scene. The customers function more as thematic props than distinct agents, and the vendor's emotional progression is steady rather than pressured by the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—healing the woman versus preserving the truth of the daughter's existence—drives a decisive, high-stakes choice. The cost is visceral and specific (becoming a "vessel," structural fractures), rooting the fantastical premise in genuine character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on direct labeling ("Elara was empathetically decisive") rather than demonstrated action under pressure. Elara faces no internal conflict or genuine external opposition; her success is immediate and frictionless, making her a functional vehicle for the theme rather than a living protagonist. The lack of struggle or error prevents any deepened motivation or earned arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vehicle than a living character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("Her motivation: to become...") rather than dramatized through struggle. Emotional responses are abstract and landscape-bound ("mind entering quaking reverie") rather than embodied, leaving the character distant and opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is a functional vehicle for the plot with no internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her "prism-minded" nature is a label rather than a trait that complicates choices; she encounters no meaningful character-based resistance and succeeds without paying a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.9)
    The protagonist functions as a cipher for the prompt's requirements rather than a realized character. Motivation is static; there is no internal conflict, contradictory impulse, or difficult choice that reveals character under pressure. The repeated use of the prompt phrase "empathy in motion" as a character tag acts as a label rather than dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("thoughtfully precise movements") and summarized backstory rather than active, embodied struggle. The emotional state is explicitly told ("hopeful melancholy") rather than shown through distinct behavior or conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("eclectic pacifist") rather than dramatized behavior. Mira's internal life is depicted through sentimental generalizations about "silence" and "empathy" rather than specific, conflicted human impulses. The realization of empathy feels unearned, arriving via a magical external mechanism rather than genuine psychological progression or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    Elias lacks internal contradiction or struggle; his ambition faces no resistance, resulting in a flat trajectory where he succeeds at every attempt. Emotional states are described via abstract labels ("sensed an undercurrent," "deepest ambition") rather than embodied in difficult choices or reactions. The character reads as a functional archetype for a fable rather than a specific individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kael lacks internal contradiction or doubt, functioning as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. Her success is facilitated by a magical artifact (the arrow tip) that guides her, removing the need for agency or genuine sacrifice in the face of the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined solely by her professional role, lacking internal contradiction or embodied emotion. The required trait "rapidly adapting" is asserted via exposition ("training taught her to be rapidly adapting") rather than demonstrated through a high-stakes tactical pivot or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    Lyra functions as a symbolic vehicle rather than a character; her motivation is explicitly stated ("to certify wonder as essential") rather than dramatized through human desire or struggle. There is no internal conflict or felt cost; she performs a ritual perfectly without doubt or genuine risk. The emotions are labeled ("wonder," "reverence") rather than embodied in reaction or specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a living psyche; his "regret" is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through specific memory or behavior. The shift from despair to resolve is triggered by a magical vision rather than an earned internal struggle or difficult choice. The realization ("failure... was not a wall but a door") feels like a pre-packaged epiphany rather than a psychological discovery made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("restless turbulence," "cold disdain," "analytical mind") rather than embodied behavior. The protagonist's internal state is described through summary ("borrowed personality sharpened his focus") rather than dramatized through distinct voice or action shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by the repeated epithet "jittery relic courier" and the stated motivation to "coax wonder." Interiority is replaced by these fixed labels, and the emotional arc—from jitters to certainty—is asserted rather than dramatized through behavior. The character feels like a passive vessel for the prompt elements rather than a person making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Seraphine is consistently characterized as a mystic-scientist, and her internal shift from seeking proof to seeking language is legible. However, the transformation feels more intellectual than visceral; the &quot;communion&quot; is largely passive, with the external force doing the work while she stands still. The &quot;firmly grounded&quot; attribute is stated but slightly at odds with her immediate acceptance of the supernatural phenomenon without rigorous testing in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mei's internal landscape is vivid, and the specific sacrifice of memories (husband's eyes) anchors the emotional arc effectively. However, the realization of the "reciprocity" cost arrives instantly upon finding the puzzle piece, bypassing the struggle of decision-making that would have deepened her agency and the weight of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Ren’s arc from meekness to defiance is legible, but the transformation relies heavily on internal labeling rather than dramatized pressure. The specific sacrifice of the rings acts as a clear cost, though the emotional weight is summarized ("grief turned inside-out") rather than embodied in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira functions as a vessel for the plot rather than an agent of choice; her critical realization about the predecessor and the method of closure arrives via unearned epiphany ("Understanding flooded her") rather than deduction or struggle. The internal landscape is described through abstract labels ("weight of withheld truth") rather than embodied emotion or conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist's motivation lacks credibility; prioritizing a sentimental ritual over relighting a failed lighthouse lamp contradicts his role as a protector. There is no internal conflict or acknowledgment of the immediate danger to ships, making his actions feel convenient rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, functioning as a delivery system for the prompt's requirements without internal friction or distinct personality. Her mastery of the "prophetic" power is instantaneous and unearned, lacking the struggle or cost required to make her choices compelling. The "laughing" trait feels forced and performative, unrelated to her actual decisions or the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is passive, functioning as a vessel for the stranger's lesson rather than an agent of change. The central realization is gifted via a magical touch rather than earned through struggle or choice. Emotional reactions ("staggered," "understood") feel performed rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.9)
    Elara is a passive protagonist who observes rather than acts; her primary obstacles are resolved by magical convenience (the sextant repairs itself) rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse in the scene; her motivation is stated but not tested by pressure. The emotional arc is summarized ("she felt her own old wound... heal") rather than dramatized through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype with stated motivations rather than embodied drive; his sacrifice is rendered emotionally null because the narrative restarts and negates the cost immediately. Interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("jigsaw of stars") rather than specific, grounded emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("compassionate recluse," "keenly empathetic") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal struggle is resolved through abstract realization rather than a difficult choice with visible cost. The emotional arc feels theoretical, with the transition from fear to acceptance occurring smoothly via an epiphany rather than visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara functions more as a thematic vehicle than a fully realized character; her motivation ("to find the sacred") is stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes choices. The "unlikely congregation" feels like a convenient set of archetypes assembled to witness the theme rather than organic participants in a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is defined by repeated labels ("gently meticulous") rather than embodied emotion or internal contradiction. Motivation is abstractly stated ("to conjure meaning") rather than dramatized through felt struggle, and the lack of a personal stake leaves the character functioning as a mechanical cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's skillset pivots abruptly from "moonshine runner's daughter" to expert engineer capable of rewiring a recording device in seconds. The emotional connection to the watch fob is established, but its function as a skeleton key for a stranger's hiding spot relies on unearned convenience rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara is a distinct focalizer whose "luminous skeptic" persona drives the inquiry and shapes the arc. The internal shift from skepticism to acceptance is dramatized through sensory experience, though the transition feels slightly frictionless. The final state ("skeptical, and at peace") offers a nuanced resolution rather than a total personality overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.9)
    Character motivation is handled via diagnostic labels ("uncork suppressed creativity") rather than dramatized behavior, and the emotional resolution feels unearned by the brief struggle. The "mnemonically gifted" trait functions as a convenient plot device rather than a deep character facet.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is clearly defined, but her motivation ("wanted to know where lost conversations go") feels whimsical rather than pressure-driven until the end. She lacks internal contradiction; her actions are purely virtuous, and she faces no genuine moral struggle or temptation to lie to achieve her goal. The "wilting" trait functions more as a magical detector than a flaw that complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a fully realized character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation is clear, but her internal struggle is summarized ("accepted this erosion") rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices. The emotional landscape feels static until the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict (static vs. function) is clear, but the emotional core ("nostalgia for a childhood never lived") relies on a familiar AI trope that feels slightly imposed rather than strictly earned by on-page particulars. The transition from robotic processor to sentimental observer is smooth but leans on stock sentimental cues ("scraped knees") rather than idiosyncratic character details.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mira is an idealized archetype without internal contradiction or flaws, serving purely as a vehicle for the theme. Secondary characters act as convenient plot devices (Samir providing the answer, the grandmother's sleep-talking) rather than distinct humans.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist is hyper-competent and lacks internal conflict or flaws; her "spirit remained unbroken" from the start, leaving no room for an arc. The character feels like a vehicle for the concept rather than a person under pressure, with no contradictory impulses or costly choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear, but the protagonist's agency is undermined by the summary-based investigation, which solves the central mystery (finding the location) off-page. The emotional arc is linear, lacking a contradictory internal struggle or a high-stakes decision that forces a character-defining trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear, high-stakes motivation. The internal cost of his success—the "heavy" feeling of the cranes and the moral weight of trading wisdom for peace—provides excellent characterization through action. While his competence is high, the final reflection adds necessary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alex and Mrs. Voss are distinct but function largely as archetypes (the eager student, the wise guardian) within the metaphorical framework. While motivation is stated early ("fascination with secrets"), the relationship develops primarily through summary rather than dramatized friction. The protagonist's internal landscape is somewhat flattened by the heavy focus on the external "grammar" of the building.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's internal conflict (skepticism vs. surrender) is clear, but the transition from resistance to acceptance feels rapid and slightly abstract rather than earned through gritty micro-choices. The motivation to archive is strong, but the emotional resolution relies on a sudden internal pivot ("simply felt") rather than a dramatized struggle against her own nature.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as a vehicle for the prompt's checklist rather than a character with genuine interiority. Her motivation is stated in abstract summaries ("stolen her father's voice") rather than dramatized through pressure or difficult choices on the page. There is no internal conflict; she executes the task with a "quiet satisfaction" that flattens any potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("richly perceptive") rather than embodied action or distinct personality. Internal states are summarized via "she realized" constructions rather than dramatized, and the sudden introduction of a lost love late in the narrative feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    Maya is defined solely by her role and function; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct personality, or emotional cost. Her "weaving truth" decision is a plot mechanic rather than a character-defining choice under pressure, and her reactions are generic (kneeling, whispering, smiling).

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.6)
    The philosopher and Kael function as archetypes in a fable rather than realized characters with internal struggle. The philosopher's "scintillatingly somber" nature is a label rather than a dramatized behavior, and Kael's skepticism evaporates instantly without generating friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is a competent vehicle for the plot, but his internal life is summarized rather than dramatized. The transition from discovery to high-stakes heroism relies on intellectual processing ("Elias understood now") rather than visceral, embodied struggle or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is clear and the internal conflict between duty and the "variant allegiance" drives the narrative effectively. The character's resignation to his fate ("loneliness finally a kind of company") provides a solid emotional anchor. However, the realization of his role is somewhat cerebral and declared rather than purely dramatized through interaction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a coherent archetypal figure with a clear desire (translation/preservation), but she lacks internal contradiction or grit. Her journey is smooth, moving from isolation to community without a moment of agonizing choice or behavioral resistance. The character feels more like a vessel for the fable's concept than a breathing individual with conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is competent and active, but the central trait ("logically emotional") is delivered via diagnostic telling rather than dramatized behavior. The internal conflict is stated as a thesis ("duality defined her") rather than felt through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a living character; her internal struggle between "wildness" and "patience" is summarized as backstory rather than dramatized in the present moment. Her actions are calm and calculated throughout, lacking the "burning impatience" or high-stakes hesitation that would prove her internal arc on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than dramatized, relying on abstract labels like "watchfully calm" and "chains of a controlling influence" to define her internal state. While the desire to break free is clear, the emotional cost feels performed via adjectives rather than embodied in the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chaplain's motivation—seeking redemption by proxy—is clear and consistent, anchoring the narrative. However, his epiphany is largely passive, triggered by Marlowe's lecture rather than a high-stakes personal choice or struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation relies on declared labels ("secret motivation," "steadily curious") rather than dramatized desire. Zephyr faces no internal conflict or difficult choices; she achieves her goal without resistance or personal cost, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined by a stated role rather than dramatized complexity; her motivation ("to find where deleted files go") is asserted rather than felt. The prompt-required attribute "brightly attentive" is inserted as a label rather than demonstrated through unique perception. Emotion is conveyed through abstract metaphors ("feeling the weight") rather than embodied reaction or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael functions primarily as a facilitator for the prompt's requirements rather than a driver of the climax; the pivotal action (blood sacrifice) is outsourced to a secondary character (the boy). Motivation is stated ("peacekeeping") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and the "shadow-laced" trait acts mostly as a telekinetic tool rather than a character-defining burden or lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's transition from "euthanasia tourist" to hopeful volunteer feels abstract and label-heavy rather than dramatized through friction. A jarring tense shift in the first paragraph ("She grips reality loosely" versus the prevailing past tense) undermines the character's introduction and immediate credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.7)
    The sentinel is a cipher for the theme rather than a realized character; he lacks internal contradiction or distinct desire beyond the prompt's instructions. His motivation is abstract ("nurture intersubjective understanding"), and he faces no difficult choices or meaningful costs that define his personality. The characterization relies on told traits ("gently persuasive manner") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.2)
    Character is a functional archetype with stated motivation ("crystallized") but no interior struggle or contradictory impulses. Emotional states are labeled rather than embodied, and the lack of resistance leaves her undefined by choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist functions as a symbolic device rather than a character with interiority or struggle. She faces no internal conflict, makes no difficult choices with visible cost, and her attribute ("perceptively calm") is applied as a repetitive label rather than demonstrated through pressure. The narrative summarizes her success without dramatizing the human friction required to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's defining trait of reticence is not merely descriptive but structural, directly causing his failure at the climax (the crystal holds no record of him). The realization that his silence was an "erasure" rather than a virtue is a strong, character-specific pivot that earns the final change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's persona is distinct, but the internal arc relies on stated realizations ("learned that clinging...") rather than subtextual shifts. The "precognitively forgetful" trait is a fascinating constraint that shapes the ending, but the emotional resolution feels filtered through diagnostic thought rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.5)
    Kael is a flat "sage" archetype whose competence is asserted rather than tested; he faces no genuine internal conflict or possibility of failure. His realization ("harnessed... by listening") appears as a summary conclusion rather than an earned shift derived from struggle, and his emotions are described with abstract labels rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    Elara functions as a benevolent narrative device rather than a character with internal topography; her "decisive kindness" faces no friction or cost. Mr. Harrow and Lena are props for the theme, with Lena's three-year estrangement evaporating instantly without psychological realism or earned emotional transition. The emotions are labeled ("poem of finality," "wound deeper than any illness") rather than embodied in action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara is defined by repeated labels ("quiet, deliberate") rather than choices made under pressure. She lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses, functioning as a perfectly competent problem-solver who faces no genuine character test. The narrative tells us her nature suited the task rather than showing her struggle against her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena's interiority is distinct, blending professional expertise with personal regret. The internal conflict (legacy vs. truth) drives the scene effectively. Moira serves as a catalyst but her dialogue occasionally drifts into functional wisdom rather than organic character expression.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.5)
    Mira is a functional archetype rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct interiority, or resistance. Her motivation is stated ("felt the pull," "sought a way") rather than dramatized through pressure, and she faces no meaningful opposition or cost in achieving her goal. The emotional landscape is generic ("smiled," "felt the weight") without specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is defined by labels ("watchful dreamer," "patience") rather than contradictory impulses or choices under pressure. Her primary struggle is retrospective, leaving her present state as a static "healing" mode without active internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype of the "tortured artist" rather than a specific individual; his interiority relies on labeled emotions ("ashamed," "conflicted") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "younger self" encounter is a stock device that resolves the internal conflict too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies entirely on static labels ("whimsical tinkerer," "whimsical heart") rather than demonstrated traits. Elara faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her success is immediate and effortless, leaving her flat and purely functional. There is no on-page cost to her actions, making the emotional arc feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; her journey is a linear procedural without hesitation or error. The reunion is unearned by personal transformation or sacrifice, as the child is found safe in a warm cabin, rendering the initial "grief" and "loss" abstract labels rather than embodied stakes. The character functions as a flawless archetype rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype rather than a complex character. He faces a technical puzzle but no internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choice that reveals values under pressure. He works "without haste" and succeeds through mastery, lacking the vulnerability or conflicting impulses required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Weaver’s interiority is effectively embodied through the "calcification" metaphor, transforming abstract emotions into tangible weights and choices. The emotional cost is palpable in the physical reaction to the burdens (the brass turning cold, the lamp growing hot), avoiding diagnostic labeling in favor of concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("harvest lessons from loss") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional arc feels smoothed over by the ritual, lacking the contradictory impulses or friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a living entity. Motivation and emotion are delivered through labels ("eroded ambitions," "regret... like a stone") and metaphors rather than embodied reaction or specific memory. The internal conflict is resolved by an external projection (the ghost) providing the answer, denying the character agency in their own redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mira functions as an agent of pure competence without internal contradiction, limitations, or struggle. Her motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") rather than embodied, and she encounters no resistance, resulting in a static emotional arc that lacks the high-stakes trade-offs required for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation and internal conflict regarding her daughter are clear and drive the ritualistic action. The characterization relies somewhat heavily on stated emotional labels (e.g., "ache of petrichor nostalgia") rather than purely dramatized struggle, but the arc of letting go is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency or internal conflict; she navigates the plot effortlessly without facing difficult choices or paying a visible cost. Emotions are conveyed through abstract labels ("serene upheaval") rather than embodied experience, and the character reads as a functional vehicle for the prompt rather than a living person.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara functions more as an archetypal vessel for the theme than a conflicted protagonist; her "infinite patience" reads as a static superpower rather than a hard-won trait tested by pressure. She encounters no internal resistance or contradictory impulses, and her success feels inevitable from the start. The interaction with Kessler is smooth but lacks dynamic status shifts or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist serves as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; she lacks internal contradiction, specific desire beyond the abstract, or any flaw that complicates the action. Motivation is stated ("to understand the geography of healing") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance. Emotional states are labeled ("felt the lonesome splendor," "act felt intimate") rather than embodied in reaction to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lysander is defined largely by his loss and his project, but he functions more as a fable archetype than a fully embodied character. His motivation is stated ("purpose solidified") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices on the page. The specific trait "hypothesizing" is applied repetitively as a label for his thoughts, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion") rather than embodied traits or choices. The protagonist experiences no genuine internal conflict; her "struggle" with her father's legacy is resolved through exposition rather than dramatized difficulty. Emotions are reported ("heart swelled," "felt the weight lift") rather than shown through distinct action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist's "skeptic" label flatly contradicts her immediate, unquestioning acceptance of a legend and magical guidance, creating a fundamental logic break. Emotional interiority is replaced by abstract labels ("realistically imaginative") that never constrain choice, resulting in a character who acts as a functional vessel for the plot rather than a human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and established early, but she functions more as a thematic vessel than a distinct agent. Her "sentimentalist" nature is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices; her primary action—weeping colors—feels ornamental rather than a driver of the plot until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    Kael is defined by his prompt attributes ("thoughtful," "fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized choice. He functions as a passive recipient of the ghost's instructions; she points to the ribbons, explains the spiral method, and corrects his misconceptions, leaving him with little agency or internal struggle to resolve the central conflict himself.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character motivation is sharp and precise; Elara's internal burden of "ethical diligence" perfectly mirrors the external plot mechanism. The conflict between preserving a "simpler narrative" and accepting a complex, geological betrayal is dramatized effectively through the discovery beat. Her final choice to redistribute the weight feels earned by the prior introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist lacks genuine interiority or contradictory impulses, relying entirely on static labels ("blithe," "quiet resolve") to signal state. Emotions are asserted rather than embodied, and the transition from "blithe" to solemn is unearned by the low-pressure events.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kaelen functions as an archetype rather than a living character; her internal landscape is composed of "models" and "scenarios" rather than messy, contradictory human emotion. The attribute "groundedly imaginative" is applied as a direct label rather than demonstrated through a difficult trade-off or behavioral quirk. Her success feels inevitable due to her competence, lacking a moment of genuine vulnerability or potential failure that would earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira functions as an idealized archetype rather than a complex character; she lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or hesitation. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("believed that even dust could learn") rather than dramatized through high-stakes micro-choices or trade-offs in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by her title and the prompt's abstract motivation ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") rather than embodied desire. Internal states are labeled ("tremor of safety," "grief") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific memories. Elara feels more like a vessel for symbolic actions than a living character making hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Malach is a distinct, focused protagonist with clear motivation (method over myth). However, his defining trait ("rationally rebellious") is told rather than shown via explicit labels, and his survival relies on a passive reaction from the antagonist rather than his own active agency or cunning.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.8)
    Character arcs are summary-based rather than dramatized; Marco transforms from a "weaponized" voice to a perfect harmonizer in a single beat without resistance or struggle. Mrs. Kaelin is a static archetype whose "expectantly resigned" nature is told rather than shown through difficult choices. The lack of internal conflict or decision-making under pressure flattens the emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mara functions as a vehicle for prompt adherence rather than a lived-in character; traits like "informally wise" are assigned via labels rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. Her motivation lacks internal conflict, and her competence is absolute, facing no genuine emotional or physical struggle. The synthesis of a chef's background with the neuroscientific concept of "synaptic plasticity" creates a jarring persona that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.7)
    The protagonist's sudden epiphany that the mechanical bees failed due to a "lack of wonder" is a severe knowledge leap unsupported by her established perspective or expertise. Her involuntary truth-telling functions as a convenient plot device to solve the riddle without generating friction, cost, or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is a functional cipher defined solely by the prompt label "creeping normality noticer," which acts as a repetitive title rather than a name. He faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or struggle, performing a magical service that succeeds instantly without cost or character growth. The motivation is stated as an abstract desire rather than a felt drive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Petra is distinct as a POV, and the shift from guardian of dogma to guardian of doubt is legible. However, the motivation relies heavily on explicit labeling ("Petra's incisively kind nature... compelled her to act") rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the "cascading" memories rather than a difficult choice between equal pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias is a compelling focalizer; his "grim optimism" is dramatized effectively through the specific action of cataloging death while hoping for salvation. The internal conflict between the wager (pride/intellect) and the regret (daughter) is resolved through a high-cost renunciation at the end, creating a robust character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; his journey is a linear fulfillment of a stated desire without struggle. The introduction of Mira relies on convenient head-hopping to validate the protagonist rather than dramatized interaction. Motivation is delivered via label ("methodically hopeful") rather than demonstrated through costly choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization is summarized rather than dramatized; Liora is defined by static labels ("cultured," "historically oriented") and faces no internal conflict or difficult choices. She functions as a plot device to execute the ritual, lacking genuine agency or human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by the label "neatly inventive" rather than dramatized choices; the solution is derived from off-page study ("three nights") rather than visible struggle. No internal contradiction or personal cost is evident, resulting in a flat functional character.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist lacks genuine agency, functioning primarily as a vessel for the advisor's step-by-step instructions (entering the maze, using the clasp, asking the final question). Her internal conflict is minimal, and the "survivor" identity feels stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a competent archetype defined solely by her function, lacking internal conflict or a distinct personality beyond the role of "prophet." While her actions drive the scene, she faces no difficult choices or doubts, resulting in a static emotional arc that lowers the stakes. The lack of interior struggle makes her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is sharp and sustains the narrative drive; her shift from seeking an answer to embodying the question is a compelling internal arc. The realization of her role as a "daughter" of their language feels slightly rushed in its articulation, but her agency in crafting the new whistle and choosing to carve is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on descriptive labels ("emotionally rational," "methodical heart") rather than demonstrated behavior under pressure. Emlyn lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her emotional arc is a smooth, unresisted progression from curiosity to satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's transformation is driven by sudden epiphanies ("motivation crystallized," "method came to him whole") rather than earned struggle or pressure. The emotional climax feels slightly melodramatic ("mortar mixed from his own tears"), and the shift from surveyor to mystic archaeologist lacks sufficient on-page grounding in his prior traits.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than demonstrated traits. Internal life is abstract and lacks genuine conflict; the protagonist functions as a vehicle for keywords rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The character's interiority is heavily diagnostic; phrases like "she understood this was the transformation" and "she knew then that..." substitute summary for embodied emotion. While motivation is clear, the protagonist's journey reads as a processed realization rather than a live struggle with conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivation is grounded and compelling, and her status as a survivor informs her actions logically. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("bleak exhilaration," "unfiltered awakening") rather than embodied experience. The internal state is told through abstract summaries of how she feels rather than shown through distinct behavioral cues beyond shaking hands.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal depth or contradictory impulses. The trait "perpetually surprised" is applied as a repetitive label rather than a behavioral driver that complicates choices or incurs cost. Her emotional arc is expository ("understood why the pilgrim had fled") rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is defined by labels and stated emotions ("guilt-ridden," "weight of unspoken words") rather than embodied struggle. The decision to abandon his career acts as a "lightswitch" change, unearned by the preceding low-stakes action. Internal conflict is summarized in abstract metaphors rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is idealized rather than complex, described via labels ("uncommonly thoughtful") rather than defined by difficult choices. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; his composure is perfect, and his actions are symbolic gestures without embodied cost or risk. The character functions as a vehicle for the prompt's thematic requirements rather than a living agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is a coherent focalizer with a clear backstory, but his interiority often relies on diagnostic labels ("backlash of regrets") rather than embodied emotion. The "merrily melancholic" trait feels performative and repetitive rather than a genuine, conflicted state derived from the situation. While the motivation to align "heart and action" is clear, the characterization leans into "therapy-speak" rather than organic reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.2)
    Character motivation relies on abstract labels ("hunted empathy," "clean slate seeker") rather than dramatized desire or specific interiority. The emotional arc is declared via summary ("motivation surged") rather than felt through reaction or friction. The protagonist functions as a vehicle for the prompt elements rather than a believable human agent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a character, defined by stated labels ("reluctant," "steady") rather than dramatized complexity. The "reluctance" of the metamorphosis is asserted in exposition but absent in the scene; she performs the ritual without hesitation, internal conflict, or a moment of doubt, flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—reclaiming lost time—is clear and poignantly grounded in the postpartum context. However, the emotional experience often filters through high-concept metaphor ("weight of a gaze," "luminous burden") rather than visceral embodiment, creating a slight mythic distance that keeps the character archetypal rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exceptional; the contradiction between the pacifist ideal and the specific act of violence (withholding medicine) drives the narrative engine. The Boddhisattva parallel is earned through action, culminating in a closure that perfectly embodies the character's internal logic. The emotional physiology (gravity linked to guilt) offers a unique, character-specific constraint that shapes every move.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    Kael functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; his motivation ("texture of transformation") is abstract and intellectualized rather than embodied. While the backstory establishes him as a philanthropist, his agency in the scene is passive—he accidentally kicks a stone, triggering the climax without intent or awareness. The interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("math of coincidence," "emptiness") rather than genuine emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Seren is active and competent, driving the plot with decisive action. However, her motivation for revolution feels assumed rather than dramatized; the shift from obedient sentinel to saboteur lacks a specific inciting emotional trigger beyond the opportunity itself. The attribute "calmly inventive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through struggle, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, rooted in a promise and a curse, and her choice at the climax to renounce power to save herself is legible. However, the "dying mentor" backstory feels like stock shorthand rather than a dramatized burden, and her internal conflict resolves somewhat conveniently through an external "warning" from the dawn rather than a purely internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("censored poet") rather than a specific, embodied individual. The central realization depends on a letter he wrote to himself, implying an unearned amnesia or performative game that undermines the emotional authenticity of the "mask slipping." Interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("geography of silence") rather than grounded psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist is defined by labels ("dueling philosopher," "diplomatically fierce") rather than dramatized interiority or choice. The mechanical arm acts as a cosmetic prop without constraining tactics or imposing a trade-off, and the opponent is a faceless cipher who creates no genuine relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist acts as a metaphorical vessel rather than a person; his "molting" is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through distinct behavioral shifts in scene. Cora is an archetype ("laugh like breaking glass"), and emotional beats use stock phrasing ("heart swelled") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an assembly of "wistful" tropes rather than a psychologically specific individual; his grief is signaled through stock gestures ("fingers tracing the ghost") rather than embodied action. The connection between his motivation (rewriting time) and his action (playing piano in a tree) operates on sentimental assertion rather than causal logic. Internal contradiction is absent; he is purely defined by a single static emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s internal conflict—balancing the empirical with the whimsical—is rendered with distinct, embodied interiority (“warm as a sleeping star,” “frequency of doubt”). The final stance of “luminous doubt” earns his character arc, showing a clear shift from measuring to interpreting. The choice to sing, breaking generational protocol, anchors his agency effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.7)
    Mara functions as a passive recipient of wisdom rather than an active agent; she arrives, listens, and obeys without resistance or contradictory impulses in the scene. Hideo acts as a "Magical Negro/Asian" trope—a functional dispenser of aphorisms rather than a fleshed-out character with his own friction. The emotional arc is summarized ("She began to understand") rather than dramatized through micro-choices.

    Strong interiority via embodied actions like kneeling in damp fabric and releasing breath; contradictory impulses between analytical stripping and emotional patterns peak in the realization moment, earning the final renunciation of isolation with humility's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—needing to quantify decay yet recoiling from its messy evidence—remains present in every beat; the moment she brushes the butterfly dust and hesitates before answering her phone shows embodied, contradictory impulse. The final renunciation (she will not return to document) carries visible cost: she forfeits control and data, a genuine loss for a scientist. Reflection stays anchored to concrete cues (watermarks, mold, wing dust) and alters her present stance each time. No other characters appear, so relationship bullets are N/A; the characterization is strong but not quite exceptional because the epiphany leans on a single, well-worn “let it be” turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his breath pluming, the heartbeat echo in droplets, the shard against his chest—yet the murder-attempt trauma is summarized rather than embodied mid-scene, muting the contradictory impulse that could have sharpened the pivot from vengeance to art. His micro-choice to melt the shard into a new vessel is visible and costly, but the adaptive trait is asserted more than dramatized under pressure. Still, the glass-as-light legacy feels character-specific and the final stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—needing to “rectify” silence yet having no voice—stays present, but the embodied emotion thins to label-speak (“sorrow a deep blue”) and none of her micro-choices after the first fork-strike alters tactics; the final renunciation is graceful but cost is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The undertaker’s “inadvertent stubbornness” is a vivid, embodied trait that drives every action, but interiority drifts toward label-speak (“weary in body and soul”). Micro-choices (gathering wire, offering blood) show value hierarchy, yet the climactic transformation into “librarian of the drowned” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the refusal to abandon the dead is a credible, costly endurance that satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s gentle persistence is shown, but her interior contradiction never crystallizes in a single high-pressure beat; the boy’s fear is named, not embodied. The elders’ memories and the bell are sketched collectively, so no individual secondary character exerts pressure that changes Mara’s tactics. Closure is communal mood, not a personal renunciation that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“camera obscura artist” perceptual lens never drops—but the final release of “unused love” is asserted rather than dramatized via a last visible micro-choice. No contradictory impulse complicates the pilgrim stance once the corridor opens; the lover’s dissolve is accepted without cost shown on the page. The arc is credible and affecting, yet the climax leans on epiphanic declaration, not an irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is rich—her shift from spatial sculptor to temporal pilgrim is textured through bodily work and chlorophyll-stained hands. The contradiction between mapping infinity and fearing her own erasure is dramatized, not declared. The final self-dissolution is foreshadowed by her compulsive tending of bridges that “exist simultaneously,” so the cost feels earned. Voice bleeds slightly into over-lyric register at peak beats, softening the emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The liberator’s interior contradiction—bound body vs. burning purpose—remains vivid and embodied; every piano-key press is a micro-choice that trades risk for advance. The chain’s metamorphosis from shackle to ladder feels earned because the earlier swing around the sentry dramatized its tactical reinvention. Only the “patiently strategic” trait is label-heavy; no on-page lapse or visible cost is tied to that adverb, so the final endurance reads slightly tidy rather than flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s wound-driven obsession is viscerally embodied; her synesthetic “diseased violet” flash under pressure shows interior contradiction in-scene. The final renunciation—letting the amplifier sink—carries visible cost, but the partner-betrayal motive is asserted more than dramatized; Kael never appears, so the relational crucible is off-page. Still, her micro-choices (collecting absences, releasing the device) cleanly align with her invented vocation, and the obsessive through-line never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lux’s interiority is lyrically specific—her belief that portraits hold heartbeats and her tactile ritual with the jar anchor her quiet savvy. Yet the emotional arc flattens: she decodes, pours, whispers, and boards without any interior contradiction or visible cost. The “luminous disbelief” never curdles; she never questions the quest or risks a loss. The result is a mesmerizing but static sensibility rather than a tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marek’s interiority is rendered through embodied, glass-specific perception (“fire was the only thing that understood frost”) and contradictions acted in-scene: he both courts memory and builds vessels to contain it. The bookmark crack as “entrance” and the gauge flicker 42→43 dramatize a micro-choice with felt cost, earning the closure renunciation. No diagnostic self-talk; every beat is filtered through blower’s metabolism of heat/breath. Flaws—frozen grief, theatrical address to dead machinery—actively shape tactics and the final stance of leaving the bowl behind.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, conch pulse synced to life-support—but the “synthetic copy” reveal is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the contradictory impulse needed for 9+. Her final vow reads as therapeutic paraphrase rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Traveler’s interiority stays generic (“felt the weight… pressing against his chest”) and never crystallizes into a specific contradiction; oracle’s “mild obsession” is label-only, never alters her tactics. No micro-choice under pressure is dramatized; the parchment acceptance is passive, not legibly costly. Yet the lone wanderer’s stance of quiet endurance fits the lyric mode and supplies a minimalist arc that the ending retroactively charges, so the baseline genre expectation is met without rising to individual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    J-3’s “burst of curiosity” is named but not embodied; no servo jitter, lens refraction, or power-draw spike dramatizes the rupture. The interior conflict—maintenance code vs. search for thought’s origin—remains abstract summary across paragraphs, so the decisive pluck feels lightly motivated rather than paid for by visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “trained eye,” the hush she breathes in—but her contradictory impulses stay off-stage; we see resolve, not friction. The moment she decides to enter the manager’s office carries no visible cost to her personally (no risk of job loss, social rupture), so the change feels administrative rather than crucible-forged. Competence outweighs struggle; quiet diligence is shown but never genuinely tested against self-interest.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s interiority is concrete—gnarled hands, dry rustle voice—and his bond to the garden is shown through the polishing ritual. The final renunciation (revealing the deception) is earned and carries visible cost: the garden mirrors his fatigue. Micro-choices under pressure are present but compressed; the heirs’ on-page pressure is thin, keeping this just below the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s obliging nature is shown through favors traded for lab access, but her interior contradiction—scientist vs. mystic—stays mostly abstract; the final lever pull is a single micro-choice whose cost (station blackout) is legible yet externally imposed rather than a wrench between competing values. No embodied emotion beyond “icy warmth” labels; mechanically warm hands recur but never limit or enable a tactile beat. The endurance of secrecy earns stasis, yet the price is off-stage tomorrow-dismissal, not a visible on-page forfeit. Still, the motive chain (fix shuttle → gain access → risk career) coheres and the character reads as an individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for inspiration vs. fear of erasing the muse—play out in concrete bow-hover hesitation. Her embodied emotion (cold cello neck, pulp dissolving) and micro-choice to complete the aria renounce perpetual haunting, paying visible cost. Interiority stays specific to a musician who “traces code with her bow,” avoiding stock artist clichés. The flaw of exploitative curiosity is accepted, not balanced away, earning the ending’s solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oracle’s “fault-tolerant” mind and peripheral awareness are shown, not told, through her calm coexistence with contradictory instrument readings and the smudge-map she alone notices. Her interior contradiction—needing to measure guilt yet fearing its mass—drives every micro-choice, culminating in the embodied release of tears that never fall. The swallowed-truth motif is dramatized as a visceral stone-in-chest that finally dissolves when she forgives, an earned renunciation that costs her the comfort of certainty. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the solo arc is complete and specific to this trained observer of chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scientist’s skepticism colliding with inherited guilt—drives every beat; the thirty-seven-bead count externalizes cost and forces the final release. Micro-choices (twisting the wheel, counting beads under spectral pressure) keep agency on the page. The only drag: “religiously skeptical mind” is asserted twice rather than shown through sharper visceral resistance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper’s interiority is consistent: her loosened grip on reality is shown through drifting, folding, floating the swan; contradiction is implied but never dramatized in scene. Motivation is clear, but the story never tightens into a high-stakes choice; she simply returns to watch again. The result is a credible, static endurance rather than an earned shift, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s quietly stubborn tenderness is embodied in every micro-action (tuning by breath, pocketing the curl). The eclipse-linked memory breach is a credible, earned alteration that leaves her “heart full of cautious exuberance,” a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—even at the lyric peak. The only minus: Eleanor’s agency is purely receptive, so relationship-as-crucible weight lands solely on Mira; still, that asymmetry is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is tangible in the tactile way he “presses his palms against the cold metal,” but his interior contradiction—yearning to rescue dreams while fearing their weight—stays voiced rather than dramatized. The moment he chooses to seal the diaries inside the thickest-walled chamber is a credible micro-choice that forecloses easier escape from his custodial burden, paying a visible cost in self-imprisonment. Still, because no secondary character appears, the relationship crucible and status dynamics bullets are moot, capping the upper band. The final beat earns stasis, but the absence of on-page resistance or alternative temptation keeps the motivation just shy of the 9-yard line.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mei Lin’s shift from passive seer to active composer is legible and earned: the specs let her convert prophecy into orchestration, and the cookie she writes for herself shows cost. Interiority is concrete—“salt air would bleach the future from her bones”—and her micro-choices (placing each cookie, hiding the case) track with motive. The flaw: we never feel her contradictory impulse to keep the old power; once she decides to “compose,” doubt vanishes, flattening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is vivid—she records silence and paints with it—but Elias remains a passive vessel; his “unraveled stillness” is told rather than shown. The final cost lands on her, not him, so the emotional arc is lopsided. Still, her hierarchy of values (paradox over dogma) is dramatized through pedal and brush.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the nautilus-as-memory-map is a vivid, embodied motive. Yet the “chronologically homesick” label is asserted, not dramatized—no micro-choice shows time-weariness costing her until the final breath. The exhaustion-at-ankles image is strong but arrives late; earlier stakes would sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gravity-defier’s interior contradiction—yearning to dissolve the labyrinth yet fearing the erasure it entails—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (touching tablet, stepping onto bridge). Her arc lands in credible Earned Stasis: surrender to infinite recursion, the cost legible in the viaduct’s crimson fade. Periodic eternity functions as constraint, not label, forcing amnesiac re-starts that shape tactics. Voice stays singular; no second character, so status/relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s embodied thaw is vivid—tears as “notes she could finally feel” lands—but her interior contradiction stays static; we never see her resist or doubt the magic process, so the change feels administered rather than earned. The drum-maker’s silence mirrors hers, yet he exerts no pressure; their relationship is a tableau, not a crucible. Still, the final micro-choice—carving the groove into the drum—ties cost to action and satisfies the 9- gate for one character.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s meticulous recording is credibly obsessive and grounds every move; the brass tube ritual and rooftop lateral climb embody micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where curiosity visibly wars with fear—so the “cost” feels intellectual rather than visceral. Still, the decision to release the pigeon is a believable endurance of risk that forecloses anonymity. Voice stays coherent; emotional embodiment stops just short of the body.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is lush and embodied (“each breath measured against ghosts of forgotten fragrances”), but the emotional arc is almost entirely retrospective; the present-scene micro-choices are limited to lifting the vial and uncorking it. The contradiction between archival stoicism and necessary mourning is present but not dramatized in real-time until the final beat, so the renunciation feels slightly under-causal. Still, the compressed elegy form justifies the reflective dominance at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but his contradictory impulses (escape vs. preservation) are announced rather than dramatized in scene; no micro-choice visibly costs him anything until the final sentence, so the “earned” renunciation feels asserted. The rope’s backstory arrives as retrospective label, not embodied memory under pressure. Still, the sensibility is consistent and the voice-specific worldview keeps the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “she longs,” “she feels” label emotion rather than embody it. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—only serene resolve—so the final smile feels unearned. The violinist’s traits (acoustic perception, mendicant past) are named repeatedly yet never complicate or limit her choices under pressure. Micro-choices are missing; the ritual proceeds exactly as planned, so no visible cost accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dealer’s detachment is credibly maintained; his “static-electric” empathy test and calibrated dosing show a professional whose craft is also his prison. Interior contradiction is present—he feels “a faint affection” yet labels himself spectator—but the beat is condensed into a single line rather than allowed to twist under pressure. The withheld micro-choice on whether to taste the dose himself keeps him from full complicity and limits the arc’s depth. Still, his voice is specific, never generic, and the ending image of “patient wait” earns a stoic, costly stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lena’s “whimsically attentive” eye supplies concrete micro-choices (loose bolt, smudged manifest) that seed the plot, and her resolve to uplift silent contributors drives every beat; the final friendship and ceremony feel earned, though her interiority occasionally drifts toward tidy summary rather than simultaneous contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s loneliness and desire to graft onto community are embodied in every reed he bends; the girl’s moss-stained fingers and silent instruction give him a tangible mirror. The final forehead press and shared frequency crystallize a credible, costly shift from outsider to kin. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the contradiction between wanting belonging and fearing further rejection is held throughout. One decimal off 8.5 only because the girl’s own stakes/inner life remain off-page, muting the relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s drive to “preserve the origin of temporal reflections” is clear and intensifies, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“she needed to…”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the final strike. The grandmother’s dying charge supplies motive, yet Elara’s emotional stakes remain abstract; we see no moment where preservation conflicts with self-preservation. The climactic decision to shatter time is credible, but the cost is cosmic rather than personal—she becomes an echo without a felt renunciation on the page. Voice remains consistent, yet the body under pressure is largely missing between the first rooftop slip and the final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vesper’s gently-inventive, secretive conjurer identity is shown through tactile ritual, but interiority drifts toward thematic slogan (“mathematics of emotion”). No live contradiction under pressure; the glass-eye placement is a single micro-choice rather than escalating stakes. Loss remains abstract until the final CR image, so the emotional cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Characterisation stays vivid, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s “kindly methodical” nature is embodied in every micro-choice—installing rungs, shifting the tape, caching the crayon—so her final invisible smile carries earned cost. The boy remains a necessary receiver rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent, but her interior contradiction (hunger to be seen vs. need to stay hidden) is dramatized in the final breath-held beat. Reflection is anchored to present tactile cues and alters next moves, satisfying BRR. One hairline slip: “sense memory was her language” edges toward label-speak, though it is instantly grounded by coal-smoke taste.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s interiority is textured—her boot-sink, the hum while she works, the slow shift from forcing wood to letting vines choose—yet the “reluctant metamorphosis” is declared more than dramatized; we see compliance, not contradiction in scene. The single micro-choice (stepping back from the lattice) is credible but isolated; no competing impulse is allowed to collide on-stage, so the change feels foregone rather than fought for. Cost is present but diffuse—loss of control is named, not felt as concrete forfeiture. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the arc lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s insomnia and need to “thresh meaning” propel every beat; her shaking hand offering the brooch is a micro-choice that costs her the last relic of the past. Interiority stays concrete—her “exhausted heart” pulsing with the island, paint bleeding into stone—avoiding diagnostic self-talk. The scavenger is sketched only enough to apply pressure, but his weathered presence still forces her stance shift. Flaw is visible: she is trading memory for future agency, and that contradiction charges the earned stasis of her final sleep.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—clarity vs. blindness—is dramatized in her grip on the pearl and the choice to surrender it; the “steady unpredictability” flaw shapes her final micro-choice with visible cost. The pilgrim remains a catalyst, not a character, so relationship/status crucible is absent; Lira’s agency alone must carry the arc and does, though barely. Emotional embodiment stays lyric rather than visceral; no bodily toll beyond trembling light. Earned renunciation lands, but the absence of a second on-page figure keeps pressure monocular and caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is consistently concrete—“her reactively visionary mind already sensing how absences could be navigated like treacherous reefs”—and her micro-choice to blow the valve is the hinge that earns the navigator’s tears and her own quiet closure. Contradictory impulses (curator vs. cartographer of silence) coexist in the same beats, and the renunciation of sound in the final note carries visible cost: she accepts perpetual exile from full sonic rescue. No stock therapy-speak; even “hearten” is enacted as physical demonstration, not label. Single-POV baseline met; no relationship crucible needed.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “analytically artistic” mind is vividly dramatized in the opening beats—ink-stained fingers, atlas consultation, seeing calligraphy in fire escapes—so her decision to abandon precise maps for phosphorescent cracks feels like a genuine internal rupture rather than authorial contrivance. The phantom ticket punch burns hotter each time she hesitates, turning a quirk into a visceral goad; her final trembling certainty is earned because the text has shown her compulsion to map absences colliding with a summons to speak. Minor slip: “she understood why she had been chosen” drifts toward abstract epiphany, but the next line immediately re-anchors the insight to her lived practice of drawing erased tunnels, keeping the moment embodied. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of calculated routes and steps into a cathedral of her own unvoiced regrets—an irrevocable stance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s “sympathetic skeptic” trait is shown early through her habitual questioning of fishermen’s legends, and her “courageously kind” drive is dramatized when she decides to use the tile for the grieving fisherman. The moment she brushes the tile and feels its pulse is embodied, but the interiority flirts with label-speak (“her motivation, as deep as the ocean…”) that blunts the contradiction we need under pressure. A stronger internal wrinkle—e.g., doubt that her mural might mock real grief—would sharpen stakes. The final softening of skepticism is earned, but the cost to her own identity feels abstract rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Althea’s interior contradiction—yearning for an ending she once escaped—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to release the fragment is earned by three hundred millennia of accumulated boredom. The amulet’s hunger gives her flaw an external voice, turning abstract immortality-weariness into tactile risk. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority sustains pressure throughout. Closure’s cost is palpable: she trades omniscience for beautiful ignorance—an irrevocable stance crystallized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sam’s interior calculus—“what algorithm justified deception for survival?”—is vivid, embodied, and drives every micro-choice; the ledger-stroke moment crystallizes their hierarchy of values. The father remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible can’t ignite, but Sam’s internal contradiction (honesty vs complicity) stays live in scene. The final stance—helping the con by refining it—carries visible cost and feels earned. Voice repetition (“mathematics,” “liquefies”) edges toward template cadence but never quite flattens the individual perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stationer’s motivation—collecting textures of non-existent time—remains conceptually vivid, yet her interiority never cracks under pressure; contradictions are lyrically declared (“she felt the weight…”) rather than dramatized in scene. Micro-choices (cutting the ghostly map, pressing gold leaf) are tactile but too ritualistic to register as escalating risk; the absence of any visible setback or wavering commitment keeps the arc static. No genuine flaw or cost is foregrounded, so the final “quiet power” reads as graceful habit, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The survivor’s haunted compulsion to collect overheard fragments is vivid, embodied (crouching, pressing palms), and internally consistent; the micro-choice to add the poison label to the box crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over safety. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“he wants to know if memories feel like burlap or silk”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final stance—nameless yet self-defined—carries visible cost: he forfeits official identity for a jury-rigged one built of scraps. No contradictory impulses are shown simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc is credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrical and specific—his contradictory mix of gloom and cheer is shown through tactile micro-choices (ear to shell, tracing grooves, laughing while mournful). The decisive turn from “myth-buster” to “myth-maker” is foreshadowed by the cello’s rising resonance and the shell’s warming, so the final stance feels earned. Cost is visible: the shell cracks, the observatory remains broken, he accepts ghosthood. The only drawback is that the woman’s erased name stays abstract, so one external relationship crucible is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—love of carnival chaos vs corporate safety—stays concrete through tactile micro-choices (pocketed stone, paint-slick fingers). The final flicker of child-recognition crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost, though earlier “dual allegiance” is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inspector’s quiet determination and embodied awe land; her micro-choices (kneel, shield eyes, whisper promise) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only gap is a missing beat where her curiosity could visibly clash with the knowledge that photographing the bloom hastens its doom—would have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Miren’s interior contradiction—blind yet “seeing” through refraction—remains embodied and active in every solder bead; the apprentice’s awe never tilts her status, keeping the artisan’s calm magnetic. The final shrug-cost (“listening to what was broken”) is earned by the mercury-and-water method dramatized throughout. Only mild deduction: Kael stays a functional mirror rather than a second crucible, so relationship pressure never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s quiet obsession with “beginnings” is vivid, but his interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“charted beginnings… tracked beginnings”) rather than embodied contradiction. The falcon feather and phrasebook act as extensions of will, yet no micro-choice on the page visibly risks or costs him anything until he kneels on the ice. The final transfiguration reads as mystical reward, not earned renunciation, because prior beats never pit his need against a live limitation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s motive is legible and constant; his centuries of listening give him credible patience. Yet we never see an interior contradiction or momentary doubt that would make the final walk feel costly to him personally—he is more mythic than conflicted. The seven townspeople remain gait-mannequins; none push back or complicate his plan, so the relational crucible is absent. Still, his embodied ritual of matching steps supplies enough micro-choice to keep the arc from freezing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s contradictory impulses—survival instinct vs mission duty—are embodied in the micro-choices of cracking her own helmet and pouring the hush. The moment her scanner locks the core while water enters her lungs, her prior dismissal of the vial flips into self-sacrifice; the cost is visceral and scaled to the length. The one flaw: “tell them it was beautiful” drifts toward diagnostic summary, a hairline slip that keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The son’s inherited shame and need to “thread a labyrinth with his own story” give a clear, personal motor; his quiet, embodied pacing and the final renunciation of speech for silence show interior contradiction. Yet the father remains a legend rather than a lived memory, so the emotional calculus never sharpens to a visible wound on the page; the cost is implied rather than felt in body or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—“breath hitched,” “tears burn”—and never particularized to her botanist training; the ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” tone is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; Elara simply obeys. The final stance is lyrically stated rather than earned by micro-choices that cost her anything visible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “haunting optimism” is repeatedly named but never embodied in a costly micro-choice; the sleepwalking is shown, yet the waking decision to follow the copper plate into the canyon is narrated as fait accompli rather than a tense escalation of her trait. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“whispering verses”) instead of concrete contradiction under pressure. The final orchid discovery reads as gift rather than earned renunciation, so the change feels bestowed, not wrested from flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“weight of the dead lightly”), her micro-choices (fitting the wedge, whispered promise) reveal a hierarchy of values, and the arc from exile to renewed faith is credibly endured rather than explained away. Flaws (dread, caution) stay consistent and complicate her gentle determination. The 20-year exile backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters her stance, satisfying BRR. No contradictory impulses appear side-by-side in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t met, but the portrait is individual, coherent, and cost-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—kneeling on flagstones, chalk dust on fingers—and the micro-choice to mail the letter at real personal risk gives visible cost. The “meaning in the margins” motive is stated early but only dramatized once, so the arc feels more symbolic than lived. The contradictions that could deepen tension (fee vs. risk; nostalgia vs. survival) stay verbal, not embodied, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—self-effacing crone vs. astute spy—embodies every micro-choice; the moment she folds the tapestry into her cloak the renunciation of safety is earned and costly. Embodied emotion (“weight of unheard stories pressing against her chest”) keeps diagnostic speak at bay. Flaws (frailty, secrecy) directly complicate her gambit, not merely decorate her. The only bar to 9+ is that the external world stays largely off-stage, so status shifts remain implied rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grief-stricken narrator’s embodied micro-choices (kneeling, releasing letters) track a credible arc from paralysis to voiced apology; the interior contradiction between rage and tenderness is held in scene. The moment-before-decision is dramatized, not summarized, and the final renunciation costs the last of his silence. Sister’s death is revealed late yet works because the shard already externalized the wound. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; Mira functions as oracle, not pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—guilt for leaving vs. need to keep translating the unspeakable—stay active in every beat; the final image of pressing coral to cast crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic (“words swim in the space between nerve and nothing”). Micro-choices (tracing cast, pressing coral) reveal value hierarchy without exposition. Only nit: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible is absent by design, not flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s “methodically playful” trait is shown through her deliberate yet whimsical use of the nickel and chime; her interiority is concrete—“she felt herself awaken”—and the final smile is earned. The shift from fidelity-to-past to curiosity is dramatized, but because the visitor is a disembodied voice rather than a full second character, relational pressure and status dynamics are muted, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s contradictory selves—compliant professor vs. seed-smuggler—are alive in every micro-choice; the taxed-thought world forces him to speak rebellion to plants, a cost already legible when the auditors leave empty-handed. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic: “feeling its ribbed surface thrum” anchors motive in touch, not label. The final whispered phrase is earned rebellion with visible legal risk. No stock epiphanies; the flaw (over-ornate diction) is stylistic, not motivational.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s insomnia and centuries-old longing are vivid, but her interiority floats in lyrical summary—“photosynthesize pain into beauty” recycles four times without a single moment where we see her body betray exhaustion or her hand shake while placing a pearl. Micro-choices are absent: the armistice blooms off-stage, merfolk “felt their rage soften” by unseen lullabies, so the turn rests on declarative enchantment rather than her visible, fallible agency. Internal contradiction is gestured (shy vs unstoppable) yet never staged; no scene shows her hesitate, then override fear at cost. The ending smile is earned only by accumulated refrain, not by a beat where she risks failure or forfeits sleep, keeping the change emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—preservation as quiet defiance versus the knowledge that nothing can be fully restored—remains vivid and embodied in every micro-choice. The fracture in her heart mirroring the cracked tube gives a sharp, recurring image of cost without slipping into diagnostic talk. Endurance is earned: she keeps the broken chime hanging, accepting imperfection as the price of continuation. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “cautious exuberance” while waiting and her decision to chain seven promises crystallize her arc. The silence-as-fear beat (“I stopped speaking because I was afraid you were right”) gives Kess a parallel flaw, though Kess is off-page until the final shard; status shift happens in the glyph note. Micro-choices (emptying the well, packing it) embody cost. No ethical chasm remains, but the earned reconciliation forecloses further silence with felt loss of time and ego.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Alia’s tactile, oil-stained interiority and the embodied micro-choice of “whispered a promise to the mountain” give credible, contradictory agency; the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets idle, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the meteorite yet letting pigeons carry pieces of himself—are dramatized in embodied beats (palming the stone, balancing on the beam). The ledger rewriting is motive, not label, and his final smile shows earned renunciation with visible cost: he closes the book, forecloses invented pasts, and trusts birds instead of paper.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s “featherly determined” stance is repeatedly named but never tested; no micro-choice risks failure or forfeiture, so the resolve stays ornamental. Interior contradiction is asserted (“light as down yet unyielding as stone”) yet never dramatized in a visible trade-off. The father’s voice is evoked as atmospheric cue rather than pressure that forces a costly decision. What keeps the score above mid-line is the tight perceptual filter—every observation is routed through the child’s maze-sense—so the persona feels singular even while remaining static.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Iyana’s exile backstory and obsessive map-making give her a sharp, particular interior voice; the burnt-feather tool externalizes her mindset and steers every beat. The final renunciation is seeded early (“she hoped to find proof”) and paid with the oxygen clock, so the cost is legible. Flaw: no second character on-page, so status/relationship crucible is absent, and the interior turn is slightly over-articulated (“she saw it: the rhythm…”) rather than left to image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered (“salt-soaked heart,” “melancholy joy”), but her contradictory impulses stay mostly declarative; the embodied cost of gathering shards is a gentle hum rather than a wound. The single on-page choice—releasing the glass to the tide—earns its poignancy, yet the micro-choices inside the geode are largely ornamental, not tactical. The flaw is muted passivity: she watches shoots grow and paths reveal themselves rather than levering open new options. Still, the voice remains consistent and the final renunciation lands with visible, quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ezra’s interior contradiction—algorithmic control vs. hunger for wonder—drives every micro-choice; the “lightly attentive” refrain embodies his calibrated detachment. Embodied emotion is lean but precise: the bishop warming against his palm crystallizes cost. The final stance (renouncing the piece) forecloses no future stunt yet carries the earned cost of permanent self-objectification—he is now an instrument of his own formula. No secondary relationship pressure on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is lyrical but loops on “cosmic verse” abstractions rather than concrete contradiction. Anchor-to-soil moment is a strong embodied choice; later beats merely re-describe her skin-map rather than test it under new pressure, so change feels declared not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glazier’s interiority is lyrically sustained yet remains observational; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure, so the “change” is a smooth semantic slide rather than a costly fork. His craft and dawn ritual supply embodied texture, but the stakes stay internal and academic—no tool breaks, no customer balks, no social credit risked. The final “tempered pane” heart is a pleasing image, yet it re-states rather than re-configures his stance. Motivation is coherent, but because no external test confronts him, the arc feels like a meditative loop, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s survivor-guilt is made bone-deep through embodied scars and the porcelain box she still cradles; the thirteen-year ache is never named, only shown in her moonlit climb and stone-circle ritual. Her decision to sacrifice the crew is filtered through fire-breath perception, not abstract guilt-talk, and the final choice—to leave the box and keep teaching—crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost. Interior contradiction pulses in the same breath: she both masters fire’s language and was mastered by it. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“survival could feel like betrayal”) that momentarily lifts the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dr. Kael’s interior contradiction—rigid logician who arranges shells to feel her way through the multiverse—drives every beat; the mandala micro-choices tighten until the 9,847-ft coefficient crystallizes her renunciation of endless rescue, foreclosing the balloon launches with luminous cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s obsession with “what walls dream” is embodied in every tactile beat—fingertips on ivy, forehead to stone—so the final shift from lament to invitation feels earned. Her contradictory impulses (obsession vs. burden) coexist in scene, not summary, and the renunciation of pure remembrance carries visible cost: she seals the report with wax and walks away from the corridor she loves. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The inherited flaw of hyper-perception drives both gift and price, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The painter’s calm is vividly embodied (“borrowed heartbeat pulsed in time”), but her interior contradiction—yearning to coax mirrors past mere reflection—never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The borrowed heartbeat motif grants texture yet behaves like a prop rather than a stake: we never feel it falter or press her tactics. Because her agency is purely ritual (sing, weave light, fade), the arc lands as graceful stasis, not earned renunciation. Still, the calm trait is specific and consistent, anchoring the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interior contradiction is present—his “operative gentleness” against the scar of a failed cease-fire—but the embodied cost is only asserted (“weight of redemption weighed on his shoulders”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the final beat. The clipboard-touch moment lets shared guilt replace personal guilt, so the renunciation is earned, yet the shift is collective, slightly blunting individual arc visibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vesper’s contradictory impulses—ruthless drought-engineer vs. relic-hoarding sentimentalist—are dramatized in the single gesture of smashing the egg; the cost (guilt-ghost echo) is felt, but interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak (“amoral truth gnawed”) rather than embodied contradiction, keeping him just short of 9-band integration.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—chastity inside a pleasure profession—powers every beat, but the “poetic body” label doubles as summary; we witness only one frisson of cost when her heart hammers under the lullaby’s pressure. Her final smile is earned, yet the absence of any visible consequence on her body or status keeps the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Adrian’s calligrapher identity, obsession with ethical storytelling, and the stick he wields are vivid, but his interiority is delivered in editorial summary rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the “quiet obsession” is told, never dramatized as a live dilemma while he performs. The audience’s micro-epiphanies are sketched, yet Adrian’s own moment of risk or cost is missing—he leaves unchanged, pockets the stick, and no path is foreclosed for him. The story’s engine is their reversal, not his.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Esme’s interiority is exquisitely character-specific—her “mathematics of loss” and the 47° angle calculation reveal an esoteric realist whose intellect and grief are inseparable. Every micro-choice (knotting her own hair through the moth wing, climbing the reed tower) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: witness over permanence, memory over survival. The final descent in darkness is Earned Stasis: she knowingly accepts erasure as the cost of witness, a renunciation foreshadowed from the first cairn. No stock phrases intrude; even “blushing stillness” is filtered through her perception of sky-as-embarrassed observer.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caster’s “technically gentle” hands and guilt-scarred interiority stay specific and embodied; the forgiveness/self-worth arc tightens across aurora-lit braiding beats. Micro-choices—threading the card, touching the glowing rope—externalize thaw with visible cost, earning the final smile. Occasional soft-serve phrasing (“her heart…beat with the rhythm of a thousand names”) drifts toward performed emotion, but contradictions stay in play. Motivation anchors every action; the cracked-bell shame never vanishes, it is re-cast into listening labor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to pattern while half-craving escape—are dramatized in concrete beats (tracing vines, climbing them at the end). The interior voice is specific, never diagnostic, and her endurance is paid for with physical cost (brittle nail, dust in hair, rain-stung skin). The “laughing fox stamp” object anchors her whimsy-scholar duality, giving micro-choices on every touch. Flaws (obsessive pattern-need, fear of unprecedented) shape the fatal loop and its transcendence, earning her final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s frugality and empirical rigor are vivid, embodied in chalk dust and stylus-scratch; the final renunciation—letting the tile vanish—carries visible cost in the emptied courtyard and his solitary vigil. Interior contradiction is light: he never doubts empiricism yet grows reverent toward pattern, a tension that could have been pushed further under pressure. Still, micro-choices (mapping grids against star charts, chalk order) align with motive and foreclose the path of possession, earning the quiet closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s “scheming pacifist” contradiction is dramatized through silent tactics and the pin transfer; the interior contradiction is shown, not labeled. Elara’s resentment is given a visceral, embodied history that justifies her dissolution. The micro-choice to return the pin carries visible cost (Mira’s own cellular pain) and earns the shift. Minor slip: “cellular memory” is stated more than embodied in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—craftsman’s pragmatism vs. dream-yearning—manifests in micro-choices (picking up the sextant, matching breath to metal). The final renunciation of containment for fusion is earned and visibly costs his human warmth. Flaw: no secondary pressure or status shift keeps him just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mender’s guilt and maternal ache are vivid and embodied; every hammer stroke carries her need to “bridge generational wisdom.” The ribbon micro-choice—tying it round the graft—crystallizes her contradictory urge to bind and to release. Interiority stays concrete (“tongue as sharp as her chisels”) and her laugh at the squirrel shows feisty warmth under pressure. Only her daughter’s sudden forgiveness feels abrupt; the apology is earned, the daughter’s internal cost less so, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Evers’s bewilderment is not a label but a lived, embodied state—his trembling palm, the way memory arrives “out of order,” the micro-choice to retreat to the bathroom. The nonlinear inheritance forces genuine cognitive dissonance that compounds across beats; his final acceptance of mourner-identity costs him the illusion of curator-agency. Interior contradiction is sustained: curiosity vs terror, duty vs transgression. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “hierarchy of values” in the final bite—still, the price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through concrete micro-choices—copying unfinished clauses, reading the reassembled phrases aloud—so motive stays legible. Yet the botanist is a passive parcel once found; his silence denies relationship-as-crucible pressure and blunts the cost she pays. The interior contradiction promised by the cipher never sharpens into a visible flaw that endangers her. Still, her steady voice against the warden supplies enough embodied resolve to earn the new pact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but stays at a single register; the “uncharted solace” remains abstract rather than embodied in a contradictory micro-choice. No visible cost is paid—she simply chooses to stay—so the ending feels like acceptance rather than earned renunciation. The dual-identity idea is announced, never dramatized under pressure. Still, her perceptual filter is consistent and the voice is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is vividly embodied in the tactile rope-work; her contradictory impulse—dismissal of impossibility vs. archival caution—drives every micro-choice. The moment she touches the Chain, interiority crystallizes: “warm as living skin” fuses motive and sensation. Closure renunciation (accepting archives will never be “complete”) is earned through prior因果, with visible cost in tingling fingers. Only minus: no second character on-page, so status/relationship bullets N/A—cap 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—devotion to silence yet compelled to act—remains embodied in micro-choices (tracing cracks, hum-intoning). Her flaws (isolation, acoustic obsession) directly complicate the tactic chain, and the final renunciation—stone dimmed, path reopened—carries visible cost in bodily fatigue and future uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The custodian’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift vs lifelong incomprehension—drives her climb, but the moment she “understood now” is summarized, not embodied; the final smile feels un-earned because no micro-choice on the tower shows her paying visible cost for that knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archivist’s interior contradiction—preemptive nostalgia vs. archival duty—surfaces early and endures, but no micro-choice in-scene actually changes her tactics; she only listens, measures, and writes. The final “acceptance” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, her perceptual filter is specific and consistent, keeping the score above mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cinder’s interiority is lyrically specific—her body registers the “gravity of hopelessness thick as tar” while her fingers remember every twist of the rag knot—yet her motives stay general: “ignite a defiant light” never meets a named personal wound or micro-choice that would foreclose a path. The mosaic word “Rise” functions as an external trigger, not a crucible that forces her to risk or relinquish something she wants, so the cost feels abstract rather than character-bound. Earned stasis is gestured at—she walks on—but the page does not crystallize what refusal or renunciation she pays for that onward motion. Micro-choices (looping the knot, striking flint) are spirited but not contradictory; they align cleanly with her single-track desire, flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s interiority is textured through tidal imagery and the jade cicada, but her contradictory impulses stay largely abstract—“rather than confront the future directly” is told, not embodied. The brother remains a silhouette; no distinct gesture or idiom separates him, so the relationship crucible never heats. The final shared understanding is credible, yet the cost feels diffuse because the brother’s leaving is still prospective; the emotional price is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    Interiority is lyrically specific (“stretched muscle contracting”) but drifts toward abstract self-labeling (“her claustrophobia remained”). The silence-collecting obsession motivates every beat, yet the inversion-hour decision is driven by external cosmology rather than an interior choice that alters stakes. Micro-choices (climb, seal the doll) are present, but no contradictory impulse complicates the ascent; fear is announced, not embodied mid-air. Closure image reweights the bunker as “garden,” a credible conceptual renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s calm, pedagogic interiority is consistent and embodied; the storm-glass reactions give concrete micro-choices under pressure. The diplomat’s shift from nervous drumming to silent tears is visible, not labeled. The vial-gift moment crystallizes her motive with cost—she surrenders her talisman—but the story lets the diplomat’s change feel slightly quick, muting the full “earned” punch.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lore-keeper’s interiority is atmospheric (“wisely adventurous” is label-speak) yet her final renunciation is felt: she gives up the throne and her chronoshawl dissolves. Contradictory impulses appear only in summary (“she paused, wisely adventurous to the last”) rather than dramatized tension under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin; the ruby flake’s pulse stands in for her own heartbeat. Cost is visible—her empty palm, dissolving shawl—but arrives more as elegiac image than character-specific wound.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The keeper’s contradictory need for solitude yet readiness to re-teach breathing is embodied in her scar-checked grip and the ring she both hoards and offers; the final smile is earned. The visitor’s knuckle-scars externalise shared history, but his interiority is thin—he never resists or complicates her method, so the relationship crucible cools. Micro-choices (ring on altar, hand-link) carry cost, yet the story repeats the same pedagogical beat for each new shadow, blunting individual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s shame-to-resolve arc is legible, but interiority drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“quiet resolve,” “dark pressure into bright gems”) instead of embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (turning the bolt, collecting dust) are present yet feel pre-explained by the cosmic rule-set rather than revealing new facets of him. The parallel-Kael irony is asserted, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual, not personal. Meets baseline change; misses the sharper internal split that would lift the arc to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is rich—“his presence eloquently silent,” “his heart a drum”—and the final renunciation (“his role was not to end… but to remember”) is earned by the standing-wave reveal. Yet the crucial turn relies on abstract ancestral testimony rather than an on-page contradiction he must physically test; the flaw never complicates his body or choice in real time, so the cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally. Still, the silent-language motif individualizes him and the memory-burden he assumes is specific to this lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Aldric’s “withdrawn” trait is asserted rather than dramatized—no contradictory impulse or social friction forces him to act against type. The vow he murmurs is the only beat where interior contradiction could surface, yet it emerges as convenient acceptance, not struggle. Cost is present (eternal servitude) but feels abstract because the prior loneliness was told, not embodied. Meets the 9+ threshold for interior contradiction only if we accept the vow as renunciation, but the lack of embodied prior stakes blunts the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marianne’s grief is viscerally embodied in how she “reads dust,” a unique perceptual signature, and her micro-choice to mail the button—without promising closure—earns the outward kindness she seeks. Interior contradiction surfaces when her hope for Marcus collides with her own irretrievable loss, yet the story stays tactfully hopeful rather than therapeutic. Her agency is credible but gentle; the button is the single prop altering her tactics and the daughter’s fate. The cost is quietly legible: she ends still broken-hearted, a refusal that reads as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is dramatized in every beat—swallowing the crystal, vomiting it back—so motivation stays embodied. Interiority is concrete (“key cold against her palm”) rather than abstract. The final endurance (key as totem) costs her bodily and socially, earning the arc. Yet the lone-hero structure keeps relational pressure off-stage, so status crucible and secondary-character pressure bullets are N/A; headroom remains.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The saxophonist’s motive—to hush a prophecy—remains abstract but is embodied through his steady breath and the hush he wields; no contradictory impulses are shown, yet his stillness at the end carries a felt, if quiet, cost. Interiority is atmospheric rather than specific, but the body–instrument link is vivid. The mission is singular and sustained, so the arc is credible, though not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lira’s quiet, ritualized diligence feels lived-in; her micro-choices (silver needle prod, spiral stacking, dust sprinkling) trace a credible arc from dutiful sorter to prophetic midwife. Interiority stays concrete—“heart quickens,” “fingers leave moonlight”—and the final smile carries visible cost after every seed is rewritten. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict beat is soft, capping above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision versus surrender to uncertainty—remains embodied in every tactile beat (oil on fingers, mineral tears on gears). The final “leave them slightly imperfect” choice is earned by the underground descent and the compass rose insertion; the cost is visible: she abandons the safety of perfect repair. No second character on-page, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Micro-choices (jamming the compass, watching the needle spin) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight over-articulation of the thesis in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—alchemist of balance who secretly hoards cracks—drives every beat; her embodied awe when the coin’s mass literally changes under her thumb shows embodied emotion without label-speak. The final micro-choice (dissolving the coin, walking out) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: naming > finding. Cost is felt: she signs her own name to failure and relinquishes the magical tool. Missing only a second character to test status dynamics, but solitary crucible is justified.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory need to heal others while remaining broken is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—angling the crocodile tooth, pocketing it beside the vial—that culminate in the self-revelatory laugh. The interiority stays concrete; “modestly fearless” is shown as practiced habit, not label. One beat of passivity—the laughter simply “came”—keeps this shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—wanting to solve mercy while refusing absolution—stays active in every beat; the pewter strap anchors her micro-choices and the final refusal carries visible cost. Proprioceptive enhancements directly shape her gait and memory retrieval without sliding into clinical exposition. No secondary characters appear, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only drag is a faint therapeutic tinge to “mathematics of mercy” self-labelling near the end, blunting rawness a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the narrator’s desire to “honor overlooked histories” is reiterated but never tested by an opposing force, so the micro-choice to pocket the fragment feels pre-ordained rather than costly. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—risk is aesthetic, not personal. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature keeps characterization above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlon’s quiet obsession with “what ceilings hide” is anchored early and paid off when he pockets a mainspring barrel—an earned, tactile cost. His observational gift is dramatized through dust-pattern reading that discovers the hidden barrels, not merely asserted. The final refusal to take all the barrels shows a credible, understated renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, though the ghosts’ backstory is somewhat spoon-fed rather than discovered through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s obstinate clinging to movable type while reality melts around her gives her a sharp, specific hunger; the trembling hands at the frost-spiral and the micro-choice to uncork the whisper dramatize an interior contradiction between control and surrender. The smile at the end is the first visible emotional shift, earning her stoic endurance a felt cost as the library’s equilibrium she guarded dissolves. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; occupation-level detail (letterpress, ink, type) is tightly woven into every beat. The only slip is a trace of diagnostic self-awareness—“she knew her translation work was marginal”—but it is immediately anchored in frost-reading action, so the penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s contradiction between defeated revolutionary and still-burning poet is embodied in every beat—he fondles the shard like a wound, chooses the black cloth of the fallen, and the final traced fracture carries the cost of irreconcilable memory. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow,” “poet’s heart ached with the weight”) without diagnostic shorthand. The earned stasis—he keeps writing, keeps covering the mirror—rings credible because the prior storm scene has already paid the price in shattered illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The repairman’s bodily “rust” as lie-detector gives him a concrete, idiosyncratic sensorium that is shown, not told; his micro-choices (naming each gear, resisting the covenant’s whispers) reveal value hierarchy under escalating pressure. Interior contradiction is present—doubt blooms into corrosion—yet the cost is felt on the page. The final renunciation of rust is earned by prior causal chain: honesty literally heals him. A hairline slip is the brief diagnostic-speak “covenant of rust screamed in defeat,” which momentarily abstracts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is sensorily embodied (“glass vials heavy,” “mineral breath”) and her contradictory drives—archivist vs. trespasser—play out in the compass-touch beat. The final renunciation is earned: she chooses custodianship over immersion, paying the cost of perpetual longing. No diagnostic self-talk; eccentricity manifests as tactile ritual. Micro-choices (decanting, kneeling, circle of vials) reveal her hierarchy of values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s quiet, tactile obsession with driftwood grain and salt-language is concrete and idiosyncratic; her decision to carve the single curved line under the archway visibly costs her prior detachment and fuses her to the lineage. Interior contradiction is light—no moment where her “perpetually learning” trait actually blocks or endangers the quest—so the arc feels more discovered than struggled-into. Still, the embodied chisel cut and the warmth of the slide against ribs keep the change credibly physical and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sable’s quiet obsession with night-blooming flowers is embodied in tactile pigment-mixing and postcard handling; the internal contradiction between scientific curiosity and lyrical hunger is visible in every micro-choice. The cathedral self-portrait moment forces a credible, earned renunciation of external answers, accepting “darkness as invitation” with visible cost: she returns home changed, paints the mural as a love letter to shadow. Reflection % is ~28 but each postcard cue triggers an immediate on-page micro-choice (palette shift, travel resolve, brush stroke), satisfying BRR exception. No status dynamics or secondary on-page characters, so caps for relationship bullets are waived; isolation is the point.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s solemn-archivist identity is vividly anchored (three decades, encrypted diary, zeppelin library). Retro-cognitive entrapment dramatizes internal contradiction—she wakes with sand in sheets—yet the Under-Minister pivot feels abrupt; his inherited silence is told more than embodied. Final renunciation (“finally slept without sand”) lands as earned stasis, cost legible. Interior texture strong; secondary-character pressure thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s refusal of nostalgia and turn toward imagination is vividly embodied in his pacing, sand-sketching, and lantern-crafting; the final smile is earned. Interiority stays concrete (“mind a clear slate,” “steady breath”) and avoids diagnostic labels. His flaw—lonely rigidity—drives the choice to keep the bottle sealed, paying visible cost in perpetual solitude. No contradictory impulse undercuts him; the only limit is that no second character tests status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is evocative—Elias’s trembling hands, phantom itch, velvet shroud—but the prophecy beat is told more than embodied; the micro-choice to immerse the wax is present yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Motive (archive emotional patterns) is stated repeatedly but never complicates or contradicts his choices; no contradictory impulse undercuts the act. The final renunciation—sealing the vault—carries a conceptual price yet reads as calm coda rather than crucible. Voice and perceptual signature are strong, so the character reads individual, but the shift from archivist to inadvertent prophet is smoother than it should be, flattening genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is lyrically rich—"texture of borrowed time like silk sliding over steel"—but the prose works harder than the action; she drifts rather than chooses until the final scatter of seeds. The vortex inheritance is invoked so often it starts to feel like a label instead of a contradictory impulse she must wrestle with under pressure. Still, the renunciation of stasis carries cost in the sprouting oak, earning a credible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized through the withheld siren pull and the microclimate readings; the final refusal costs her the safety of certainty and the village’s blind trust, a visible price that earns her Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on cold plastic, the rope’s glue-stiffened curve—avoiding label-speak. The only drag is a touch of retrospective omniscience in “they would have fled,” slightly smoothing the contradiction that could have sharpened the stake.

    Sola’s spiritual-curious trait and janitor role blend into one credible stance: she sweeps star-dust while questioning the void. Interiority stays concrete—hands on meteor-iron patches, voice in low chant—but the shift from loneliness to empathic strength is more reported than embodied; the climactic “quiet strength she had never known” is told, not micro-chosen. Still, her consistent vulnerability and the glass-cradling gesture give a solid, character-bound through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her attention to “dust motes” and the “weight of unspoken words” is character-specific—but her contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized; the moment she resolves to mend the covenant is summarized rather than shown. The cost of her vow is implied, not embodied; we are told the weight “burned brighter” but never see her body register the price. Still, the quiet endurance at the end feels consistent with her perceptive stillness, earning a modest Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s congenital-beaten interiority is vivid; the pulse-spread moment externalizes her borrowed-time dilemma with bodily specificity. The shift from message-scatterer to co-prism reader is credible because the urn fragment has already altered her perception. Interior contradiction shines when she pockets the shard after deciding she “no longer needed” the heartbeat. Slight undercut: the coalescent figure’s dialogue is filtered through Elara yet remains abstract, softening status dynamics at the pivot beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but generic; the poet’s “fractured heart” and “longing to be whole” are labels, not embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after finding the feather alters his next action—he simply writes, then leaves it behind. The renunciation feels pre-ordained, not paid for by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elias’s quietly systematic temperament and mortal deadline fuse into a single, believable engine; every micro-choice (spiral wrap, vine braid, fevered final clamp) springs from the same stoic resolve. The diary acts as externalized memory, letting his father’s voice ghost the beats without interior monologue clutter. His bodily decline is shown through tactile detail—hands shaking yet spiral “true”—so the cost is felt, not declared. The ending’s dissolution into root and wire is earned because his life has been a slow translation into caretaking syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The exile, skepticism, and scientific ambition are cleanly established; her interiority is concrete (“chemistry of homecoming… haunted her research”). Micro-choices—pocketing the amber, kneeling to sample—embody motive. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the 9+ test misses; cost is present but generalized, not scaled to a single sharp beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—silent ferryman of grief yet compelled to sing life back into dead ground—is dramatized through embodied micro-choices: scattering pods, digging for moisture, whispering in forbidden tongues. Each action exacts a palpable cost (dust in lungs, cracked skin, voice raw). The final stance—continuing to plant while knowing the war-dead remain present—earns its quiet renunciation. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Wick’s grief-sniffing transition from body-finder to message-archaeologist is credible; his paw-level micro-choice to press the leaf into the hatch lock crystallizes his arc. Interiority stays animal: scent-maps, ear-drum Braille, no anthropomorphic self-analysis. Contradictory impulse—duty vs. abandonment—remains present but under-played; one more beat of visible physical cost (limping, dehydration) would push to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lone narrator’s motives—survival, ancestral tether, and the need to keep moving—stay legible throughout; the compass-pull micro-choice that swings him toward the hatch is an embodied beat. Interiority is concrete (“each heartbeat echoing twice as long”) and avoids stock therapy-speak. The only minor drag is a slight over-cranked lyricism that can edge toward performed awe rather than fresh perception. Still, the endurancecost of stepping into the void is felt and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.7)
    Kaelen’s “chivalrous thief” contradiction is only asserted, never dramatized: no moment shows mercy clashing with larceny. Interiority is plush-purple (“sacredly playful”) rather than embodied; fear simply “dissolved.” The mandate from the vanished master is accepted without resistance, so no internal hierarchy of values is ever tested. The only visible cost—the cracked heart he must carry—registers as external prop, not character wound.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and embodied; his tremor on the marble ‘r’ shows interior contradiction under pressure. His micro-choice—handing over the pawns—is a visible hierarchy of values with social cost. One slip: his “I am a historian” line flirts with diagnostic self-labeling, but is saved by the follow-up gesture of stepping. The final renunciation (staying) is earned by prior causal steps and bears real opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s “steady pulse” motive stays visible in every micro-choice; the cracked-mirror eyes and mercury-glass tag remain embodied, never abstract. The final decision to press the feather is the earned, irrevocable cost that forecloses retreat. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the story leans on lyric accumulation rather than scene-scale duress, so the deepest contradictory impulse is implied more than dramatized. Still, the refusal to turn back feels personal, not symbolic, and the mercury-glass metaphor constrains perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tutor’s guilt-steeped interiority is viscerally embodied (“clung to his conscience like a stubborn shadow”) and drives every micro-choice; the moment he accepts the pawn from the girl crystallizes a credible, costly shift. No diagnostic self-talk, but the reflective blocks edge toward 20 % and the girl is more emblem than crucible, so relationship pressure stays mild. The Earned Stasis—teaching again with no guarantee history won’t repeat—lands with felt cost, yet the flaw-compounding is stated more than dramatized after the key is found.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “innocently mischievous” interiority is concrete and embodied; his charcoal-stained hands keep moving even while Elders demand silence, dramatizing the trait so it feels like a compulsion rather than a label. The micro-choice to hurl pigment-coated glass at the spire is the payoff—his flaw drives the decisive beat. The only limit is that Mara’s own pressure is told more than shown, so the relationship crucible never quite forces a mutual cost in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“uncertainty was her discipline” grounds every micro-choice. The brass scarab acts as an externalized motive, turning memory-quilting into tactile ritual. Her final inhalation of poison air is a credible, irreversible cost that earns the earned stasis. Minor ding: “kintsugi intentions” verges on label-speak mid-crisis, but the body’s burning lungs immediately re-anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s nostalgia and self-promise are dramatized through the tactile act of painting the shell in the hidden pool; the contradictory impulses—clutching versus releasing the shell—play out in scene. The interiority stays concrete (“salt-laden breezes of memory”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the shell) is legibly tied to prior causality and carries felt cost. Minor slip: the “weight of the past lift” is slightly abstract, docking a hairline 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is gorgeously particular (“screaming tenderness held behind her teeth”), and the jasmine-cork as emotional Rosetta stone gives her a tactile, embodied motive. Marcus remains slightly schematic—the bark-then-tender arc is credible but leans on the lighthouse magic rather than on milked contradictions in his own gestures. Their final micro-choice—his trembling hand, her quiet “tomorrow”—earns the eleven-month standoff with visible cost. Still, the relationship crucible forces a stance shift, so the arc satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority stays concrete—maps as scars, solder joints bearing loss—so grief never abstracts into cliché. The censer foot’s tug translates desire into micro-choices (midnight activations, circuit soldering) that visibly foreclose retreat. Final stasis—phone silent, foot now anchor—pays the earned cost of irrevocable reunion. Minor slip: “dust-streaked face” drifts toward stock image, but embodied tension elsewhere holds.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s shift from secretive rationalist to steward of communal truth is embodied in the tactile handling of the eye and the orchard ropes; the interior contradiction between safety and honesty is kept alive in scene. The final stance—measured, communal disclosure—feels earned because every prior beat tests the cost of involuntary truth. Minor shortfall: the “rational truffle forager” label is asserted more than dramatized—no truffle or foraging choice ever constrains tactics—so the occupational trait stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cornelius’s loneliness and vocation fuse into one credible stance; the micro-choice to keep the boutonniere crystallizes his arc. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays anchored to lantern, mist, and petal. No secondary character on stage, so relational crucible test is waived; head-count clarity remains intact. The final endurance costs him nothing visible beyond loneliness already owned, so the change feels tender rather than pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Merrick’s grief-driven obsession is viscerally embodied: the matrix “a second heartbeat against his lonely ribs.” Interior contradiction—rational map-dealer versus mystic pilgrim—survives until the final step. The renunciation of his mapped life is felt, but the turn pivots on an off-stage voice (“Clara’s promise”) rather than a fresh micro-choice inside the cavern; causality is borrowed, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    The queen’s interiority is vivid—velvet cloak catching thorns, breath as “only constant”—and her disenchantment is embodied rather than labelled. Yet the decisive surrender to sentinel-hood is asserted more than dramatized; we are told she “found she no longer belonged” rather than shown a micro-choice that costs her a concrete piece of self. The flaw is diagnostic summary in the climactic beat, softening the earned edge demanded at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The alchemist’s interiority stays lyrically consistent, but the promise of “contradictory impulses in scene” is only weakly delivered—her micro-choices (mixing indigo, sealing the curl) feel pre-decided rather than torn. Kael functions as a courteous echo, not a pressure source; status/relationship dynamics never shift. The “density of presence” motive is repeated but never tested by a visible flaw or mistake, so the final resolve feels inferred, not earned. Still, the embodied sensory cues (star-in-coat weight, vial warmth) keep her from sliding into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lucid-dream chronicler’s interiority is vivid—“jealous of past selves who still believed time was a line”—and his embodied micro-choice to carve the scroll mid-air shows a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of singular identity is earned: sap glowing from the letters is the visible cost. Flaw: no second character, so relationship crucible bullet is N/A; otherwise motivation scales cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s anosmic grief is embodied through tactile obsession with the midwife screw and auditory surrender to the clock; her shift from control to translation is credible, but the interior voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“I had been treating my loss as a blank page…”) that softens the contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelin’s interiority is textured through bodily tremor, ink crystallising under stress, and childhood superstition re-purposed as grounding ritual; scars-to-stories motive threads every micro-choice, culminating in visible tear-offering that crystallises into luminous rune. Contradictory impulses—terror of reopening pain vs need to speak it—stay active in-scene, not summarised. Final renunciation of fear is earned: each crystal records a released memory, so stepping onto drifting rock feels like foreclosed path with cost already paid. Slight over-reliance on “felt” as filter keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is textured—her guilt is shown through the trembling perfume case and the metaphor-laden apology; the micro-choice to power the coil costs her social pride. Linden’s shift from skeptic to collaborator is visible in the shoulder softening, but his motives remain slightly generic; more contradiction could have pushed this into 9-band. Still, the relationship acts as crucible: the apology alters their stalemate, foreclosing the safety of silence with the cost of public exposure now possible.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The witness’s interior contradiction—aching to unify yet forced to surrender—remains vividly embodied: the dictionary warms, pages graft to ribs. Motivation intensifies from abstract desire to fated acceptance, earning the climactic renunciation. No second character or status crucible appears, so relationship bullets are waived. Micro-choices (foot placements, finger traces) manifest her hierarchy of values under impossible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’ interiority is concrete—his pocketed key, the backward count, the heartbeat-synced drip—and the final renunciation of forward time is earned by the tactile ritual. The “eminently peculiar” trait is shown through his gear-whispering rather than labeled. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the conflict is purely intra-self. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he understood then that clocks do not count what has passed…”) which slightly over-articulates the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—security guardian who learns to unlock rather than lock—remains embodied and concrete; the moment they deactivate the eastern alarm matrix is a micro-choice that visibly costs their prior identity. The old woman’s presence supplies external pressure, forcing Kael to a renunciation that is scaled to the story’s lyric arc. No stock therapy-speak; “spatially gifted” is shown as lived perception, not label. Closure is earned: the new protocol is drafted with steady fingers, a quiet but irreversible forfeiture of the old binary worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lila’s contradictory drives—academic rigor vs. inherited superstition—are dramatized in embodied beats (fingers on lantern, overlaying transparencies). The final vow to teach “without the pain of loss” crystallizes an earned renunciation, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“lucid contradictions were not puzzles…”) that lightly blunts emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“cultivated estrangement like a gardener tending a thorny hedge”—and her thawing is embodied in the tactile risk of climbing the stool to shatter the disc. Yet the decisive break-the-loop act feels lightly motivated; the text tells us she “wondered” about the disc but never dramatizes a specific trigger that makes tonight the night she must snap it. The micro-choice hierarchy is present (stay on the line → weave stories → destroy disc) but the final step leans on poetic fiat more than accumulated pressure. Still, the contradiction between her walled-off habit and the emergent need to give strangers beginnings is credibly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is concrete—her reverent fingers, the shiver of “haunted euphoria”—and her choice to write the covenant anew is embodied. Yet the contradiction between preserving fragility and forcing regeneration is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see her hesitate or err, so the flaw feels safety-hedged. Micro-choices (climbing the hillside, steeping tea) mirror values but carry no visible cost; the ending’s cost is atmospheric, not character-bound. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s “desperately jocular” mask is embodied in every beat—she laughs at crumbling walls, trades jokes for stories, and the contradiction feels lived-in. The interior cost is visible when her laughter “softens into something genuine,” showing a micro-choice that forecloses her exit before dawn. No stock labels; even the blind ticket-puncher’s status shift (murmuring the rock-glow rumor) is staged through action. The final renunciation—leaving the fragment, slipping away—pays off the prior causality; loneliness is confronted, not cured, so the cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific detachment vs. visceral surrender to the forest’s grief—are alive in every beat; the moment she kneels and lets the stillpoint “seep into her bones” is the visible cost that earns her later quiet blaze. Interiority is textured through synesthetic perception, never label-speak. The ring’s cooling→warming arc tracks her shifting hierarchy of values without exposition. Blind spots (she cannot see constellations) compound the stakes, making her endurance the only credible resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—hunger to revise guilt vs. recognition that every edit erases someone—stay active in scene, culminating in the renunciation when he lays the dry pen aside. Interiority is concrete (“air tasted… old regret”), micro-choices visible (which memory to ink, which to let fade), and the final smile shows earned endurance with cost. The confidently-uncertain stance is dramatized, not labeled, driving every edit. No secondary characters on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A; slight safety-hedging in moral ambiguity keeps this just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s thirty-seven-year vigil is a haunting, embodied obsession—hands lifting a filmless camera nightly—that externalizes interior erosion. The advisor’s charisma is shown through gravity that “bent the air,” not exposition, and her signing catalyzes his first micro-choice: lowering the camera to join the silence-map. Interior contradiction pulses when joy collides with the ache of being forgotten, crystallizing in the final renunciation: he stays, composing for no ears. Cost is legible—he forecloses re-entry into human memory—yet the shift from passive waiting to active composition is slightly under-dramatized in one beat, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kael’s contradictory drives—guilt-driven penance and the analytic hunger to reconstruct—are shown through embodied gesture (tracing ash, mixing pigments from their own past). The micro-choice to begin painting with charcoal made from their earlier arson is a sharp, credible turn that crystallizes the value hierarchy: truth > self-preservation. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, “volcanic tenderness” gives a sensory, geologic idiom to shame. What keeps the score sub-9 is that the mentor’s dying words arrive as a convenient memory-flash exactly when needed, slightly diluting the causality of the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—drumming on his own ribcage to translate Mira’s echo—yet the “shared dream” motive is asserted more than tested; no mid-scene micro-choice lets us watch him abandon an alternative path. The final dissolution lands as earned stasis, but the cost is felt more in image than in a prior decision we witnessed him wrestle. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marek's interiority is concrete—his "calculated spontaneity" is shown through the folded-map ritual and sprint through darkness. The contradiction between order/chaos pulses in the same beat, embodied in the coin burn. Secondary pressure from the smuggler's whispered bet is immediate and status-laden. Final renunciation—keeping paper maps, smiling at next storm—carries visible cost of perpetual vigilance; the 9+ test is missed because the renunciation is stated, not dramatized in a micro-choice beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation and interiority are clear, especially in the turning moment where he decides the time has come to act, but his journey is delivered in summary, so agency feels rounded rather than granular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound dockworker vs. dancer—are embodied in every beat; the scrimshaw glow and guardian dissolution externalize the internal lock. The final renunciation of the pier-rope is earned by the whale-call summoning her hidden skiff and her micro-choice to sway rather than lift. Visible cost: she forfeits the safety of the docks and the social identity they gave her. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak; the dancer’s kinetic diction is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid—grief “pooled like dark water,” the bouquet whispered to—but the performer’s contradictory impulses (informing vs. carving) are asserted rather than enacted in a single pressured moment; the final stance is credible yet the cost feels diffuse because the dog report is only foreshadowed, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s aesthetic obsession is palpable—she touches quartz, translates hum into verse—but her interiority loops in lyric summary rather than contradictory impulse. No micro-choice visibly costs her anything; the “tremor of certainty” is declared, not dramatized as conflicting desire. Because she walks alone, relationship/status crucible is N/A; still, the absence of a tested flaw or trade-off keeps the arc below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown, not told, when she lures Dorian with the plant-music demo; the internal contradiction plays on stage. The color-blind painter filter sharpens every perceptual beat—she “feels” warmth instead of seeing red, a consistent bias that later charges the final image. Dorian’s stoic-glassblower persona never cracks into back-story dumps; his shift to embracing flaw is legible solely through the molten droplet he places in her palm. Cost is present but soft—no irretrievable loss—so the arc stops just short of 8+ “visible price” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her perceptual filter (“fractured light dancing across walls,” “golden shadows thickening the air”) stays specific to her synesthetic science-artist mind. Contradictory impulses are shown in the same beat: she clings to imperfection while chasing measurable truth, crystallized when she tilts the lens “one degree off-center.” The micro-choice charges the closing image: she accepts dismissal of her data as “corrupted,” a visible cost that earns the resonant stance. Mara's function is thin—her skepticism acts as a foil, but her sudden trembling on the lens feels more plot servant than crucible pressure; still, the primary arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s contradictory motives—selling hollow consolation while craving authentic re-connection—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (folding, dissolving, gifting). The final renunciation of commerce for communal witness is earned by the prior origami/beacon cycle, but her interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“white dwarf grief”) that blurs embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is consistently particular—measuring the loft in millimeters to anchor abstract collapse in physical space. The trait “steadily curious” is dramatized: she refuses to comfort the client, instead multiplying paths with the cards, a micro-choice that visibly costs him emotional ease. Her flaw—hubris of pattern-making—implicitly complicates the ending: she’s building the next culture but may be repeating the same god-complex. The architect’s trembling hands and loose suit give secondary pressure without crowding the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lush and sensorily anchored (“anguished joy,” “breathing irregularly”) but tilts toward performed emotion; the repeated abstraction “end of innocence” is asserted not dramatized. Micro-choices are present (touching the pagoda, withdrawing) yet causality is loose—why this exact moment of withdrawal prevents mind-loop collapse is inferred rather than shown. No genuine contradiction under pressure; the character remains competent and emotionally self-aware without visible blind-spot cost. For 800-word limit, a single focalizer is acceptable, but the absence of relational crucible limits pressure depth.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority leans poetic rather than embodied; “luminous regret” is named more than felt. The stone-as-catalyst choice is credible, but the emotional cost is filtered through lyric summary, not live contradiction. Enough micro-choices (pressing the stone into the screen, pocket now empty) anchor the arc, yet the peak beat cites feeling rather than dramatizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—shame versus the need to keep caring—remains concrete in every micro-gesture (trembling fingers, deliberate feeding of brochures to the stove). The tail-tip injury externalizes her complicity and gives her a tactile penance to perform, so her choice to heal Veridian first is causally earned. Minor over-articulation (“balance wasn’t about never falling…”) edges toward diagnostic-speak, clipping the top band. Still, the final blue shift of the chameleon crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s “closure seeker” motive is announced, but her interiority stays lyric-abstract (“meteor hush,” “verses in a poem of survival”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure is visible: she passively notices, listens, kneels, rises, smiles—each reaction is reported, not tested. The plant-telepathy enables discovery but never constrains or costs her, so agency feels ornamental. Earned stasis is asserted in final lines, yet the causal chain is atmospheric, not behavioral.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “mapping each wire as constellation memory” and “spatially imaginative mind” seeing molecular structure—so interior contradiction is alive. The final transfer of stored love into her body is a renunciation that costs her silence and solitude, earned by the psychometry beats. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; headcount stays within default. Micro-choices (suspending strip, hand on tank) reveal value hierarchy and foreclose demolition-era escape.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “trapped creativity” is declared, not dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The only embodied beat is lying on ice; no visible flaw or cost drives the final release. Motive stays static; the sextant and stars act upon her rather than revealing hierarchy-of-values decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The guard’s dreamlessness, freight/guard duality, and lullaby-charm are vivid and embodied; the null-zone confrontation forces a sacrificial planting that costs voice and self, earning closure. Interior contradiction is present—“occasionally everywhere” vs final “nowhere”—but the archive’s thousand eyes and quantum steps remain abstract, muting micro-choice granularity. Still, the renunciation lands with felt price, satisfying the 9- gate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrically rich—“She understood that the mechanical rainforest was not a prison but a question”—but stays abstract; no embodied contradiction or visible cost anchors her shifts. The gear turns, but the woman’s hierarchy of values remains a smooth parable, not a pressured choice. Closure is a serene acceptance rather than an earned renunciation, so change feels preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lin’s interiority remains textured—salt air sharpens grief, the pocketed ticket warms against skin—yet the dog’s off-page survival and the guides’ oracular calm feel convenience-plotted rather than pressure-forced. Emotion is embodied, but the decisive reunion lacks a micro-choice that costs Lin anything visible; the star stamp is mislaid, not wagered.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guilt-to-vigilance arc is embodied in every stair-climb; the bolt-in-palm micro-choice keeps self-punishment tactile. Interiority stays concrete (“nerve endings screamed”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The final renunciation—she will speak, not rejoin—costs her the choir identity she craves; causality earns the stance. Only minor lapse: Milo is referenced but never lived on-page, so the emotional halo feels second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sylvar’s guardian identity and quiet thunder presence are vividly embodied; his micro-choice to inscribe rather than confront shows a credible hierarchy of values. The moment he places hand on rune crystallizes his stance with visible cost—his ink spent, vigil resumed. No interior contradiction or alternating summary weakens him; the only lack is a second layer of internal conflict that would push him to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lina’s witnessing role is credibly anchored in embodied ritual—each tap of the railing reveals interior contradiction between helplessness and compulsion. The interiority stays specific to her; no “climate grief” clichés intrude. The shift from passive recording to active chart-making is earned by the atlas page cue and lands with visible cost: she accepts the station’s drift as her only fixed point. Micro-choices (tracing ink, tapping curvature) keep the arc intimate, though the stakes never tighten beyond observational endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s barefoot, stargazer-turned-signal-finder identity is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to press palms to stone and sing a lullaby crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, and the contradiction between observatory loss and newfound ground-level “sight” is held in scene. The flaw driving the action—her need to find meaning rather than fight—stays active and costs her solitude, turning into broadcast vulnerability. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; barefoot tactility and opera-glass talisman function as intimate “other.”

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s quiet, plant-tuned interiority is vivid and consistent; her gnarled hands, ash-trained empathy, and forty-year subversion feel lived-in. The moment she palms the seed to her grandson crystallizes a credible, costly shift from guardian to cultivator. Secondary characters stay functional, but the grandson’s one nod is too thin to serve as crucible; the real pressure is internal, which the piece honors.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through somatic memory—his fingers “remembering” her palm pressure anchors grief in flesh rather than therapy-speak. The contradiction between clinging to the photo and learning to release constant touch is dramatized in the final beat when he folds rather than cradles it. Micro-choices (sketching roots, pressing palm to bark) externalize quiet talent while accruing visible cost: the photo “seemed less crumpled,” implying the body now archives the memory. Closure earns Earned Stasis: he forecloses the old compulsive ritual with felt price—stillness that costs perpetual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s painterly eye and physical tremor are embodied in every tactile beat; her refusal to paint “what people showed her” becomes the micro-choice that re-threads the lighthouse. The interior contradiction—yearning for light yet embracing darkness—remains alive in scene, not summary. Closure’s cost is felt: she abandons the safety of surfaces, nails humming with un-lived lives, a credible renunciation scaled to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—his pale skin “drinks” light, his anger is “quiet fire”—and the micro-choice to spill ink onto the drone is character-specific. The contradiction between wild instinct and leashed control is shown, not told, in the moment he “kept it leashed, focusing on the ink.” No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the earned endurance of losing the drone forecloses the path to immediate answers and carries visible cost. The only minor flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“he knew now that the secret…”—but it is embedded in a physical gesture, softening the slip.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the nitrogen haze crystallizing her choice—and the contradictory impulses (oath vs truth) act live in the instant she feeds the letter. The moment she “smiled, bravely conflicted no longer” feels slightly fast; we’re told the conflict ends more than we feel the cost of its cessation. Still, her micro-choice hierarchy is legible and stakes scale to length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s pacifist reflex is vivid in micro-gestures (sheathing the knife, tea ritual), and her perceptual gift is shown, not told. The father-shadow supplies credible interior conflict, but the stranger beat is too polite—his departure note is a soft reset that costs her nothing. Earned stasis lands, yet the emotional plateau feels slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avery’s calm fisher-of-echoes persona is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to voice silence and then release the echo shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, but the repeated “cool-headed” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand and the absence of any contradictory impulse in the climax keeps her just short of 8-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Victoria’s contradictory impulses—dread of paternal guilt versus hunger for editorial integrity—stay alive in every beat; the rosewood nib as blood-drawn stylus literalises the cost. Her decision to send the counter-memo is not an epiphany but the culmination of twenty years of micro-choices, each one seeded by the mirrored images of telescope/black-hole. The only restraint from 9+ is that the board’s power is asserted more than shown; a single glare from an actual editor would have tightened the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s guilt-riven vocation and her bodily anchored expertise (ink on skin, needle in hand) give her a sharp, particular interiority; every beat where she re-tunes the tattoo gun or hears infant wails through her own circuitry shows contradictory impulses—erase vs. preserve—played out in scene. The babies’ live signals bleeding through folds make the cost visceral and legible. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived; micro-choices escalate credibly to the final renunciation. Final silence earned by prior causality, but a little more embodied fraying at the climax would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chalk artist’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “read the silence like braille”—and her motive to “discover meaning in the mess” is dramatized through the risky act of drawing on the mandala. Yet the contradiction between whimsy and the solemn cost of rewriting communal memory is asserted more than embodied; we never feel her regret or fear in her body. The final smile feels unearned because the prior beat shows no micro-choice that costs her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Arin’s interiority is vivid—“heart forged in frost and flame,” “retrocognitively trapped”—and his micro-choices (kneeling, cupping the tessera, carving the name) embody the steel/empathy tension. The contradiction is present but toggles rather than acts simultaneously; we get frost, then flame, not both at once. The final stance is earned: renaming costs him the last warmth in his pocket and forecloses forgetting. Still, the enemy-soldier memory is asserted more than dramatized, keeping motivation just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost’s hunger for applause is vivid and embodied (“restless hunger for one more ovation”), and his final act—flicking the coin to weave his memory into the actress—constitutes a credible, earned renunciation with visible cost (his own dissolution). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the synesthetic color-hearing is shown, not labeled. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count stays clean. Micro-choice (the coin flip) directly forecloses his lingering presence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lina’s affectionate skepticism is alive in her eye-roll at the recall news and the pocketed geode, but the interiority drifts toward poetic self-diagnosis (“willowglass hope flickered”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decisive turn—using the geode as resonator—arrives as a declared plan, not a forced micro-choice with visible cost. Earned stasis is implied, yet the emotional price feels poetic rather than somatic. Still, the single-POV voice stays consistent and the geode-touching beats keep her tactile and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical and vocation-specific, but her contradictory impulses stay theoretical ("she aimed to become the voice...") rather than enacted until the final song. The fossil-guided choice is sudden and lyrically framed—lovely, yet the cost of merging with the cave’s grief is asserted more than embodied. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent, and the endurance of carrying the fossil outward reads as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lyrically embodied—“unearthed silence,” “quietly inspired”—but her contradictory impulse (obedience vs release) is asserted more than dramatized; the final relinquishment of glass prisons is earned by decades of catalogued labor, so renunciation carries cost. Still, the micro-choice that tips her is off-stage; we are told she “began to understand,” not shown the beat where the shift crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—guilt over betrayal vs. need to repair—remains concrete and embodied in the pillbox rub. Micro-choice to dig is credible, but the courier is a blank: no status tension, no idiom, no secondary pressure. Final relief is earned yet slightly tidy; Elena payoff undercuts the cost Kael just paid. Still, the flaw-compels-mistake test is met: his earlier betrayal created the snow-burden he must now excavate.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    Silas’s thirty-seven-year vigil is credibly distilled into tactile habits—needle, reins, gutter metronome—and the final alignment of the two needles externalizes his inner contradiction between memory and renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never slipping into label-speak, yet the palimpsest metaphor is repeated more than it is enacted; we watch him “read shadows” but never see one concrete palimpsest act before the closing image. The micro-choice to drive the last crossing without speech is earned, but the woman remains a silhouette, so the relationship crucible is implied rather than staged. Still, his flawed constancy and the cost of emptied time feel legible and scaled to the piece’s lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kai’s calm, tactile interiority—clay under nails, thrum in palms—stays embodied and particular; the contradiction between her scientific curiosity and reverent care is shown, not told. The final renunciation—leaving bowl and glass—costs her the literal lens that first revealed the oasis’s secret, so the gesture is earned. Yet her “motivation humb[ing] beneath her ribs” skirts diagnostic shorthand; once that shorthand is uttered, the moment never regains full sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the rose’s memory while choosing horizontal abandonment—are dramatized in the tactile shift from trellis to asphalt. The bitting-gauge’s re-purposing embodies her grandfather’s precision turned into horticultural defiance, and the final “letting go” costs her the vertical garden she once defended. Interiority stays concrete (“gauge fit her palm like prayer beads”), never drifting into label-speak. One hairline slip: the phrase “geometry of grief” flirts with abstraction, but the next sentence grounds it in asphalt scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered and her motive—transmute isolation into stewardship—drives every beat; the embodied shift from passive “observer” to active “bridge” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (touching the sundial, recording hums). Yet the arc leans on summary more than scene, so the moment of irrevocable cost is felt conceptually rather than through a single, body-level beat that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s interior ache is lyrically evoked, but her shift from private ghostwriter to public artist is declared rather than dramatized in-scene; the moment she “enlists” collaborators happens off-page, so the cost of exposure is felt only atmospherically, not through a visible micro-choice that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s cautious hope is dramatized through micro-choices—pressing headphones to ears, night-after-night recalibration, risking the tower—so the trait alters tactics rather than decorating her. The interior contradiction (hope vs. mounting evidence of malevolence) is kept alive in-scene, culminating in the visibly costly decision to fry the antique console. Flaws (naïveté, academic isolation) actively complicate the power plays and alien gambit rather than serving as backstory labels. The final “shield of charts” stance shows earned stasis: she keeps the job, the community, and the burden, cost felt in burnt-ozone exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and compass-hand tremor are shown, not labeled, and her micro-choice to press the copper tip into stone despite panic is a crisp beat that earns the key. Interiority stays concrete (“the metallic whisper that echoed the organ's lowest note”), anchoring her contradictory impulses. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the compass as heirloom grandfather-relic supplies credible motive without over-telling. The final renunciation—treasure is knowledge, not gold—carries visible cost as she re-imagines the city’s future, satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s face-blindness and methodical armor are concrete from the first beat; the shift from cold arithmetic to desperate warmth is dramatized through brush-strokes and ribbon-touch rather than label-speak. The final renunciation—returning the ribbon—pays the cost of reopened empathy, earned by every prior micro-choice. Interior contradiction is alive in scene: “precision wasn’t habit—it was armor” versus “she painted faster now, not methodical but desperate.” Only the off-page sister/roommate voices feel slightly convenient, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s contradictory impulses—scientific caution versus ancestor-loyalty—are dramatized in trembling fingers, lung-clogging dread, and the override of safety protocols. Each micro-choice (pinning the nail, entering coordinates) visibly climbs the risk ladder toward the final dare. The copper nail against her heart crystallizes a believable, costly allegiance. Only the director’s off-stage protests keep this from full 9-band compression.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fiddler’s contradictory fear-of-loss/need-to-sing impulses are embodied in trembling fingers and the decision to decode wind-map; interiority is concrete, specific, and drives every beat. No second character on page, so status lens waived. Flaw: “pixelated amnesty” is diagnostic jargon delivered twice without embodied cost; slight therapy-speak. Final renunciation—burying the past via song—lands with visible relief, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The son’s polished calm is shown through bodily stillness and the micro-choice of painting silent warnings rather than arguing; his contradictory wish both to protect Leo and to understand circular fate is kept alive in every beat. Interiority is concrete (“rusted rails of the abandoned circus train” triggers sensory memory, not abstract rumination). The final renunciation—letting Leo walk away with the foreign bill—pays the cost of their shared dream and is causally prepared by the trail of symbols. Only the father’s shadow remains a touch under-instrumentalized; it never loops back to tighten the son’s own choice, so motivation edges toward 8 but doesn’t cross.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly ambition vs. inherited duty—surfaces early and culminates in the 3:47 AM keystroke that reweights the telegram. The embodied tremor of her hands and the mirrored ancient scribe give credible lineage to her final renunciation. Yet the predecessor’s frantic notes are told, not dramatized, so the generational hand-off feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is concrete—his hand slipping into the pouch, the taste of ash, warlike serenity as blade-before-strike. Contradictory impulses (duty vs guilt) coexist in scene, not summary. Final renunciation lands because the prior beat shows him planting the seed he once feared; cost is visible. Only nit: “guard the world once more” drifts toward abstract mission-statement, muting the felt personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the scar-mapping, root-binding, and palm-takeover of the clipping dramatize her contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance—she will plant herself as threshold—carries visible cost (palms threaded silver, ancestral wounds re-opened) and is causally seeded by the maze visions. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page character to spar with) but her internal crucible is strong enough for this length. Voice stays particular, never drifting into therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. professional insulation—are enacted in the single beat of deciding to keep the cloth, but the interiority drifts into summary (“She wanted to discover purpose after loss”) rather than embodied contradiction at the precise moment of choice; the cost is felt yet not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s haunted ambition is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming the seed, carving with star-iron—each carrying palpable cost. Interiority is concrete and occupation-specific; “the wedge-shaped signs that might have anchored the spirit’s departure” marries craft to longing. The final renunciation (carving her name as witness, letting the fruit fall) is foreshadowed by her patient mentor voice, earning the closure stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s hybrid nature—brass gears vs. “human heart”—is dramatized in the micro-choice of venting the crucible only halfway. Contradictory impulses (archival duty vs. olfactory trigger) coexist in the same beat, not summarized. Final stance of “never the same self” is earned by the creel refusal that visibly costs her protocol compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.4)
    Mara’s contradictory drives—protocol vs. empathy—are embodied in every beat: she pockets the shells instead of tagging evidence, then physically squeezes through the fracture, micro-choices that escalate to the pearl-crowning moment. Interiority stays concrete (“the pearl seemed to warm against her palm”) rather than diagnostic; competence (dosimeter, structural scan) is balanced by the genuine stumble when she hesitates. The final endurance—she stays silent, lets the caves broadcast—costs her career path and is foreshadowed by earlier rule-breaking. No safety-hedging: she is complicit in the illegal act that re-opens communal grief.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s withdrawn-medicine fragility and river-chronicler eye stay concrete—her breath-counting, frayed-map ritual, ivy-whispers all embody her need to measure and memorialize. Contradictory impulse (guilt vs. survivor-urge) surfaces early but is told more than dramatized until the accordion touch; interiority flirts with therapy-speak (“path to self-forgiveness”). Micro-choices (tracing graffiti, leaving the bellows) show hierarchy of values yet the climactic relinquishment is lightly motivated—no prior beat shows why leaving the bellows equals absolution. Still, the specificity of her perceptual lens and the visible cost of enduring memory keep her credible and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrically charged ("stolen time," "forgotten memory") and motives stay consistent, but the dreamer's wants remain abstract ("unspoken words") and no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the final renunciation is poignantly imagined yet causally thin—no prior micro-choice visibly forecloses reading the silence. The veiled persona is atmospherically vivid yet emotionally monolithic; cautious exuberance is named more than enacted. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Earned stasis is felt, but the cost is conceptual rather than embodied. Above competent, short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lira’s interiority is sensorily rich (the mulberry ache, fracture-mirror reflection) and her renunciation is foreshadowed, yet the decisive moment—“she told the envoy that the instrument was too fragile to travel”—is paraphrased, not dramatized, softening the felt cost. The telepathy and violin obsession are vividly embodied, but the empire envoy remains a silhouette, muting status pressure. Emotions edge toward performed rather than contradictory under peak pressure. Still, the final stance is coherent and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s vocationally specific stillness, hereditary pattern-reading, and renunciation of touch compress a believable interior life into one on-page ritual; the final gesture of “whispered dedication” crystallizes values without exposition. No contradictory impulses collide mid-ritual—only poised execution—so the arc is credible rather than complex. Cost is present yet conceptually framed; a visible wince or tremor would have pushed higher. Voice is consistent, occupational, and singular.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to Aria’s hairpin while pruning grief-soaked grapes—are dramatized in embodied, micro-choices (scalloped cut, sigil traced with the pin). The final renunciation of wine-making for simple jam is earned by seventeen harvests of visible cost; her flaw (refusing release) compounds until the tree-perch witness beat. Interiority stays concrete: “soil and rain and honest work” rather than abstract peace. No stock therapy-speak; the hairpin carries both burden and blessing without narrator gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrator’s “conscience-for-hire” premise is stated, not dramatized: no client payment, no ethical dilemma, no moment where the shard or chimes force a choice that costs them. Interiority drifts into lyrical self-label (“protected vulnerability,” “sincerely insincere”) without on-page contradiction or stakes. The cloak slips off as a symbolic gesture, not a tactic with price. What keeps the score afloat is the embodied sensory attention (ash on coat, salt wind) and the micro-choice to unhook the lantern; still, the character remains an atmospheric observer rather than an agent whose flaws compound.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to youth while orchestrating her own erasure—are dramatized in concrete beats (casting the pebble, stepping off the platform). The final renunciation is earned: each withheld memory visibly buys the luminous dissolve. Interiority stays particular to her reverse-clock biology; no diagnostic labels. Cost is legible in the sentence “each reversal erased a memory,” a price repeatedly enacted rather than merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The skimmer’s historically reverent nature is shown through tactile ritual (arrowhead, quartz disc) and her refusal to move, but the interior contradiction—yearning for travel while immobile—never sharpens into a scene-level choice that costs her anything. The mentor-chain backstory is compressed yet efficient, and the final beat of becoming teacher crystallizes a soft arc, yet the emotional stakes feel abstract because no external test forces her to risk her creed.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vorrin’s “underachiever” identity is dramatized through his patient, passive craft rather than trait-labels; the final refusal to extract the keystone is the earned culmination of a lifetime of valuing slowness over yield. Interiority stays concrete (“his hands growing more calloused as his magic grew more numb”). No secondary character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A. Cost is present: he surrenders pension, warmth, corporeal form—visible in the closing image of his body dimming to match the stone’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s synesthetic quest is concrete and embodied; the key-tag warmth against his palm and the ladder descent dramatize obsession. Interiority avoids labels—he “hears” color, never explains synesthesia. The renunciation of surface life for silence carries visible cost: soaked coat, lungs burning, solitude. Micro-choices (tucking tag, opening log) reveal hierarchy of values without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—quiet enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt—stays active in every beat and is embodied in micro-choices (coin-casts, pressing forehead to amber). The final “soundless smile” crystallizes Earned Stasis with cost: she accepts eternal unknowing. No second character on page, so relationship bullets skipped. Motivation is clear and scales to the cosmic stake without psychological leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The reaper’s ache is vividly embodied—hand on cold brass, pocketed mirror that reflect a heart still able to ache—and her contradictory need to name every fear except her own keeps pressure alive. Her final refusal to name her own fear is a credible, earned renunciation with cost visible in the mirror shard. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s “lukewarm” magic and brittle devotion are shown through obsessive drip-counting and the driftwood mallet—concrete, embodied choices. The internal split between doubt and earnest naivety is active in-scene as he tilts the bell “by a hair’s breadth,” not declared. Final smile costs all his spent magic, so renunciation is earned. Missing 9+ only because the cosmic imbalance feels abstract; the personal price is clear, the universal stakes less so.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nora’s “precisely humane” trait is shown, not told: she kneels to rescue a label, cradles wet photos, writes by lantern-light. The memory-surfacing beat (poisoned-water revelation) is credible because the cue (sapphire label + distillery images) is concrete; her decision to rewrite the report costs her calm and carries ancestral guilt. Interiority stays sensory, not diagnostic. One flaw: the grandmother story is delivered in a single retrospective gulp—slight tell—but the micro-choice to pocket the label and keep walking keeps the arc alive.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Contradictory impulses—logic vs. intuition—are dramatized in micro-choices (placing crystal into flame, surrendering calculation). The “pressed violets” motif externalizes sacrificed softness, giving the internal conflict a tangible, recurring cost. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she foregoes the sterile crystal for warm shard of possibility, renouncing her lifetime method. Sentimentality remains a label until the violet offering; the beat lands but could carry more embodied risk to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“muscle memory,” “cold metal,” “heartbeat matched the hum”—but motivation stays abstract: “preserve trust” is asserted, never tested by contradictory desire. No interior contradiction surfaces; the revision sequence proceeds smoothly, so the choice carries no visible cost to character. The buckle-as-token is evocative yet static; it never jeopardizes or re-weights his identity. Earned change is missing; the ending posture is resolute continuation, not foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sensei’s contradictory impulses—numbness vs. the ache to feel—are dramatized in the single gesture of pressing palm to jar; the final synthesis of clone-selves lands as earned cost because every prior beat literalized the split. Interiority stays concrete (“grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade”) and avoids label-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: he forfeits perfect emptiness to reclaim pain, a visible price that forecloses the path back to ego death.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s inventor-enthusiast streak feels vivid in her tactile seed-planting and mirror-puzzle sketching, yet the “notably receptive” tag is asserted more than dramatized. Interiority stays concrete but never cracks under contradiction; she’s serene from arrival to exit, so no visible flaw complicates her resolve. The closure vow is internally consistent yet costs her nothing we see—no lost time, money, relationship, or risk—so renunciation lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s spectral grief and “mournfully eager” interiority remain concrete—her pull-cord grip warms, wind thrums through absent lungs—so embodied emotion and contradictory impulse stay on the page. Micro-choices (ease grip, gentle final yank) visibly calibrate risk to Sarah’s sanity, enacting her hierarchy of values at cost of self-dissolution. Interior contradiction stays live: she both craves reunion and accepts erasure. Flaw complicity absent: the piece never lets her test or confront limits of ghost agency, so growth plateaus slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The guardian’s interior contradiction—guardian instinct vs exile-ache—surfaces in every lick of ice, giving a concrete micro-choice that digests the world into memory. Emotion stays embodied in frost-bit tongue and matted fur; no diagnostic labels. The final smile is earned: centuries of waiting crystallize into a stance that costs the last warmth. What keeps it from 8+ is the absence of a second, sharper external pressure that forces a forked decision with visible fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—stoic face, trembling sensitivity—are dramatized in the mortar-and-blood moment; the final renunciation (snapping the serpent-head) carries visible cost and is prepared by three generations of failed journals. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The “hopeless” label is earned, not declared, and her flawed persistence feels individual, not archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is sharp—her grease-blackened fingers, the “practical relief” of tears—but the mentor’s dying words land as an unchallenged mantra rather than a lived contradiction. The final realization is earned, yet the emotional cost is stated (“pressure release valve”) more than dramatized in body. Still, her micro-choices—stripping modules, touching the shard bare-skinned—track a legible arc from transmitter to listener.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lina’s resilient positivity is embodied in her steady hands and radio-voiced resolve, but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible cost; she remains affectively flat across beats. The final smile feels unearned because no micro-choice shows her battling despair or paying a palpable price for hope. Micro-choices (tracing spirals, pressing transmit) are present yet mechanically described, not filtered through a distinctive perceptual signature. Captain Roedskal’s nod is the only status shift, but it is too brief to function as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—Mira’s “fever-hot fingers” and silent steps anchor her obsessive architect mind. The contradiction between control-hungry weaving and her final surrender is dramatized, not declared. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible unused. The earned renunciation—“connection is a medium to inhabit”—lands with visible cost (empty hands, broken fever), satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s “balancedly curious” nature is shown through tactile obsession with the anchor link and her refusal to surrender starlight; the final moment where she watches Corin become his own compass crystallizes a credible, earned endurance with visible cost—she will never see real stars yet keeps teaching their memory.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s curiosity is embodied through the hearing-aid micro-choices and the kneeling compression beat, giving credible interiority. The “contact tracer” label is never translated into a concrete occupational tic, so the supposed vocation feels decorative. The final hand-clasp supplies a visible cost, but the arc is thin: curiosity leads straight to rescue without interior contradiction or loss. Still, the voice-specific perception (yellowed plastic, static breath) keeps characterization above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marek’s claustrophobia and survivor-guilt are embodied in every breath and tremor; the augments, codex, and tide clock externalize contradictory urges without therapy-speak. One clear micro-choice—hand flat to the terminal—pulls all prior motives into a visible cost. Interiority stays concrete and oceanic, though “their own name…dark and cold” edges toward convenient emblem.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Contradictory impulses—life-in-death clerical error vs. ghost-in-silica—are dramatized through ink-tracing and shard-contact beats; the final resolve to “mend her own life” is earned by prior mirror-work with the ghost. Heartbeat-counting recurs as embodied cost, not label. Micro-choices (pressing shard to screen, pouring ink) reveal value hierarchy under pressure; no competence overreach. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual bias—circuits taste “old,” static “cleared”—avoiding diagnostic speak. Flaw drives plot: her ghost-file status lets her read the ghost’s fracture map, making the error a crucible, not backstory ornament.

    The copper-veined storyteller’s contradictory impulses—her need to save the stone-tongue versus her recognition that its perfect translation will never be heard—are shown in the climactic act of pressing the diamond to the bone wall and later leaving it behind; her quiet endurance costs her the last of her voice and life, an earned stasis that forecloses every future path. The micro-choice to channel the spinebirds’ flight through her own metallic veins literalizes her body as conduit, making her final oxidized stillness a credible physical price. Interiority stays concrete and particular (“copper pathways,” “metallic veins catching the last light”) without therapeutic abstraction. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount is within default and never clouds choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    Lyn’s bitterness-to-joke conversion is declared early but dramatized only at the very end; the interior contradiction between researcher protocol and personal ache never sharpens into a micro-choice that costs her anything on screen. Elian’s “silent as stone” state is evocative yet never pressures Lyn’s tactics—he’s a prop, not a crucible. The metamorphosis beat is accepted rather than chosen, so the visible cost is diffused across lyric imagery instead of a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—cling to familiar music vs. risk cardiac self-re-wiring—clash inside two beats (shell press/violin amplification) and culminate in a renunciation (body locking, orchid-dust payment) that is foreshadowed by grandmother memory and costs her pristine heartbeat. Interiority stays concrete (“locust ridges sync with ribs”), flaw drives mistake (she nearly petrifies herself), and micro-choice hierarchy (beauty>self-preservation) is legible. One hairline slip: “mechanical world tried to erase” drifts to thematic label-speak mid-climax. Cost is visible: body stiffens, shell burns to dust—earned stasis achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mailman’s guilt-driven nightly returns and his self-forged storm-bottle give him a sharp, specific interiority; every beat is filtered through the vow he broke. Micro-choices—handing over the north-side plea, launching the drone—are visible and costly, but the moment he watches the mother read the storm-message is summarized, not embodied, so the final cost is more observed than felt inside him.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—silence vs. the compulsion to restore—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (oil on frozen gears, fitting the halo). Yet the climactic “song” is declared not dramatized; we get label (“he sang”) rather than embodied vocal rupture, so the cost feels asserted, not witnessed. His flaw (obsessive quiet persistence) is shown but never complicates or endangers him; it simply succeeds. Result: a credible arc, but the pivotal release beat is under-embodied and therefore under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The librarian’s twenty-year obsession with the zeroth volume is concrete and embodied (scarf-map, silent conversations with books). Her micro-choices—folding the scarf into ever-stranger topologies—escalate under pressure and foreclose the safe option of staying outside the portal. The corduroy man remains a mirror rather than a crucible, so relationship dynamics are thin, but her solitary contradiction (archivist of memory who erases her own past via starlight release) is cleanly dramatized. Cost is visible: the scarf’s pristine reset implies she has paid in decades of stored time.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is lyrically specific—her “deliberate punctuation” up volcanic rock, the camera “heavy with brass and intention”—but her emotional contradiction is implied rather than dramatized in-scene; the renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Micro-choices (brush-stroke, shutter-click) visibly manifest her hierarchy of values, fulfilling the 9+ test, though the embodied intensity plateaus before the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Merrin’s quiet resolve and practiced ritual interiority feel individual; her longing for a key to her own fear lands as earned cost. The client’s trembling hands and silent acceptance show credible fear without therapy-speak. Yet both women remain slightly archetypal—“locksmith who frees others but not herself” risks trope—and the mother-truth is confessed only by proxy, so the deepest contradiction is declared, not dramatized in scene. Still, micro-choices (braiding/unbraiding hair, ribbon released) tie motive to gesture and the ending forecloses Merrin’s wish with visible ache.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s chronically-curious folklorist identity drives every visible choice—climbing the Mariana, chalking star-maps, culturing spores in a bait cooler—so motive stays coherent. The interior contradiction is present but narrated rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told “some truths cut” instead of watching him flinch from a memory shard. The final renunciation (leaving the glowing mushroom, never returning) is foreshadowed and carries visible cost, yet the emotional stakes plateau before the last paragraph, muting the sense of genuine struggle under restored memory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s renunciation of return is earned: every annotation stroke, backward step, and tremor of tea-spill shows the price of choosing Lin over homeland. Contradictory impulses—yearning for return versus protective mentorship—coexist in the same beats, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete (“tremor slightly as she pours”), never drifting into label-speak. Final smile cracks the stern mask, proving micro-choice hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vespera’s insatiable creativity is dramatized through the seven-day weaving ordeal, her refusal to hoard seeds afterward, and the embodied sap-stains that mark her cost. The interior contradiction—salvaging wonder by draining it—drives every beat without tidy resolution. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so the relationship crucible is waived; her sole agency under an accumulative lens is credible and scaled to lyric length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s guilt-driven compulsion to unravel the net is visceral and embodied; the pearl pressed to her scarred cheek crystallizes the cost. Interior contradiction—terror of memory vs. need to speak—drives every micro-choice. The final shift from hiding behind masks to offering them as sanctuaries is earned, not declared. Only a trace of diagnostic self-labeling (“I was afraid”) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is granular and profession-specific—she “touches the rain-scoured fresco vault above, feeling the textured history under her fingertips,” a tactile beat that marries curiosity to reverence. Her contradictory impulses (methodical vs. empathetic) coexist in the same moment of reopening the chapel, not in alternating abstracts. The final choice—documenting quietly rather than proclaiming—carries visible cost: she threads the tear with silver, forever marking her own cartography with vulnerability. No diagnostic speak; every emotion is embodied in glue-scented air and silver filament.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cassian’s quietly analytic nature is embodied in every beat—gloved fingers turning the globe, noting viscosity, tapping the brass chest—so the trait is never label-only. The interior contradiction between measuring grief and feeling it peaks when he records the snowflake-settling rate while the globe “pulsed with its own minute gravity,” showing science as both shield and longing. The final micro-choice—packing the globe as artifact, not prison—caps a credible renunciation whose cost is the cold exactitude of his last written equation. Mort’s patient presence supplies steady secondary pressure, making their relationship a crucible without ever drifting into explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The balladeer’s desire to “give melody to the phantom’s ache” is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a concrete, costly choice; her interiority drifts in lyrical summary rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. The scribe’s sudden adoption of the same mission feels imported rather than earned. No visible flaw or blind-spot complicates either woman; their actions trace a smooth arc of beneficent artistry. Because the closing vanishing is more image than trade-off, the required “earned stasis” is only gently present, keeping the score south of 6.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kai’s inquisitive devotion is embodied in the tactile act of stealing the diary and risking the goggles; the moment they see the captain’s praise of their “geometric precision” the servant’s private emotional ledger is rewritten with undeniable cost—quiet devotion is now mutual revelation. Interior contradiction is alive when grief collides with the dawning need to keep this intimacy secret; no epiphany is declared, only the silent removal of the goggles that forecloses return to anonymous service. The micro-choice to read on while the elevator climbs literalizes the moral stakes: higher altitude = deeper trespass, each floor a rung of irreversible knowledge. Character-bound knowledge holds: Kai never “understood” the captain until the lenses teach them; competence and flaw stay co-present, no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s obsessive need to “prove emptiness remembers” is dramatized through the risking of her life to speak the suppressed truth into the recorder; the embodied tremor in her hands on the cold brass and the deliberate tethering of the canister to her chute make the cost corporeal. The seventeen-year echo of Thorne’s grief is her internal contradiction—she both reveres science and betrays its codes—forcing a final micro-choice that narrows her world to sky-witness. Flaw: the laugh-stock backstory is summarized, not lived in scene, so the social cost feels inherited rather than freshly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s face-blindness and fractal coin-seeing are vivid, but his interior contradictions stay static; no micro-choice under the demolition clock changes his tactics—he paints the wall, then simply leaves. The promised “limits discovered by trying to surpass them” is told, not dramatized in a beat where he risks or forfeits anything. The endurance is lyrical, but the cost is off-page; we witness no visible failure or renunciation that forecloses future art. Still, the perceptual signature is strong enough to satisfy the 9- gate for this length.</question>
    <question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored sky is demolished yet already “escaped,” reweighting the premise that art can outlast its physical support. The because/therefore chain (coin → wall → sky inside → scatter of dust) is fractally legible and lands with felt cost: “the sky, now free, expanded beyond any wall.” Lens is cleanly Causal; every beat narrows time and options until the final image flips loss into limitlessness. No orientation debt; transitions are seamless.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The hollowed yew-library is not postcard scenery; its cracking bark and spiraling shelves physically constrain Kael’s reach and set the ticking clock. The coin’s warm ridges function as micro-setting, guiding fingertip sightlines that transfer sky to plaster; this tactile tool charges the final scatter of “fractal dust.” Spatial choreography stays clean as Kael moves from anatomy shelf to wall to exit. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—mirror sky before bulldozers—tightens once: dawn light creeps, siren wails, wall shimmers, then falls. Protagonist agency is present but low-burn; the meaningful turn is conceptual (sky escapes) rather than a decisive physical gamble. Cost is visible in the demolished wall and the felt scar on the city, but Kael personally pays no tangible forfeiture beyond walking away. Still, the escalation under causal lens is coherent and sufficient for 600-800 words.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inverse of limits: attempt to cage infinity and infinity evades. Final image of sky “already escaped” reweights every prior fractal brushstroke without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; meaning resides in the reversal of containment. The resonance lingers because the price is the building itself, not an articulated lesson.</question>
    <question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Third-person lyric voice is fractally patterned—sentence rhythms mirror branching lines, diction stays within painterly lexicon. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Kael’s fingertip-seeing world. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-driven (“he could feel the geometry”). The heightened stillness modulates into drum-beat demolition without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s diligent curiosity is shown through concrete action—decoding the hopscotch numbers, tracing carvings—rather than labels, and her final solitude carries a felt cost. Yet the interior contradiction (ambition vs. isolation) is stated more than dramatized in-scene; the moment she “realized the phrasebook had been left for her” is summary, not embodied micro-choice. The earned stance is visible, but the emotional layering stops short of genuine irrationality or flaw-driven mistake. Still, for 750-word scope, the arc is coherent and renunciation is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith's interiority remains atmospheric rather than personally contradictory; she is more mythic agent than textured human. While the "rhythm of repair" motif recurs, it never collides with a competing want—there is no moment where she hesitates, doubts, or pays an embodied price. The final smile and pocketed gear gesture toward earned change, but causality is cosmic, not psychological. Still, within the lyric-situational lens, the arc of accepting memory's tide reads as a coherent renunciation with visible cost in the softened mirror-glow.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characters function as a communal "we," which flattens individual interiority; no single psyche shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Ghost lacks motive beyond benevolent template; community’s shift from skepticism to trust is declared, not dramatized. Final spiral chalk mark gestures toward cost but no one visibly forfeits anything, so Earned Stasis feels asserted, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The adjuster’s beautifully flawed nature is dramatized through her tactile intimacy with the broken puppet head and her willingness to dissolve it; the contradiction between savior and failure is embodied in every micro-choice on the spiral stairs and at the spindle. Interiority remains concrete—she “traces,” “imagines,” “lets”—never abstract self-diagnosis. The renunciation of the toy and of sound itself costs her the last relic of the child, a price legible in the “weight of its absence.” No other characters appear, so relational crucible is N/A; the single-POV interior arc is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her reluctant duty, the tactile memory of her grandmother’s voice, the way she “cursed softly” while still placing the nut within a millimeter. The renunciation at the end (gathering the nuts, retreating unheard) is an earned stasis that costs her the travelers’ gratitude and any hope of relief from the curse. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single beat, so the 9+ bar is missed, but the characterization is strong, specific, and fate-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interior voice is poetically specific (“symphonically tuned mind”) and grief is rendered as polymer-chain imagery that re-enters later beats. The micro-choice to release the chrysalis crystallizes her hierarchy of values, but the sister remains off-stage; status/relationship crucible is therefore absent and the shift feels slightly abstract rather than interpersonal. Still, the contradictory pull between mourning and synthesis is dramatized through embodied perception of foam and river, avoiding label-speak. Cost is felt—she walks away humming—but the sister’s absence keeps the emotional price one notch below visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor’s renunciation of her own incision is credible and carries cost, but her interiority is largely abstract (“mindfully scattered,” “deliberately scattered”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the woman customer is a passive recipient, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Micro-choices are reported, not staged, keeping pressure at arm’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The chef’s contradictory motives—absorbing others’ remorse while craving his own release—are etched in every tactile micro-choice (“I tasted her memory… grief was metallic”). His body registers the cost (hands tremble, heart cracks) without therapeutic self-labeling. The final act of kneading bread with ghost-weight shows earned endurance, the price of vessel-hood visibly paid. Interiority stays sensory, never abstract, making the brittleness feel inevitable, not symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “empathetically decisive” trait is asserted, not embodied; she never faces a true contradiction that forces a costly choice. Interiority is limited to lyrical paraphrase (“her heart full”) rather than moment-to-moment friction. The closure beat—filing songs under “Community Symphonies”—is cute but carries no felt renunciation or risk, so the arc feels administratively tidy rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The engineer's interiority is gorgeously particular—"helix-minded," "chaotically precise"—and her motive to excavate abandoned dreams is dramatized through the tactile handling of the mirror and the canyon's synaptic tremors. Contradictory impulses (restoration vs. self-erasure) coil inside every beat, culminating in the earned cost: she becomes artifact, sleeps entangled with the rocks she rewired. No stock phrasing, no safety-hedging; the character's competence is balanced by the palpable risk of losing her own boundaries. Voice, perception, and diction remain singular and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archivist’s drive to protect the archives is declared rather than dramatized; we never see a concrete stake erased or threatened, so the “latent blaze” reads as abstract motto. Interiority is atmospheric (“purpose ignite within her chest”) but lacks contradictory impulse under pressure; she glides from beat to beat without error or self-doubt. The only micro-choice—leaping back through the threshold—happens once the inversion is already ending, so the cost feels environmental rather than character-forced. Competence is total, struggle is nil, so change is muted; the ending stasis is more exit than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sculptor’s interiority is lyrically present yet stays curiously friction-free; no contradictory impulse ever threatens her serene quest, so her choices feel pre-ordained rather than risk-laden. Micro-choices (tracing cracks, fashioning bow) are tactile but never force her to relinquish anything or adapt under pressure. Result: empathy is declared, not dramatized at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s exile-guilt and need to “discover beauty in the difficult” drive every beat; the stone’s release is a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority stays concrete—thumb in dent, pulses under knees—and the final disappearance feels earned. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s pacifist ethic is named, not dramatized—no moment forces her to choose between violence and empathy—so the “eclectic” label stays ornamental. Interiority is vivid (“Silence of anticipation, metallic, cold”) and the micro-choice to leave the clasp unlocked costs her the safety of ignorance, earning a credible shift. Still, the lack of external opposition keeps pressure interior and stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s quiet obsession with scent and stillness is concrete and embodied; the mortar-and-dew beat shows micro-choice under pressure. Yet the interior contradiction never sharpens—he wants serenity, gets it, shares it, smiles: no real flaw or cost complicates him. The minstrel’s arrival supplies external pressure but Elias remains unchanged, so the “bridge between still and swift” feels declared, not earned. Still, the olfactory specificity and ritual doodling keep him individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is sensory and pilot-specific (“glider’s wings catching invisible currents”), her motivation cleanly rooted in family survival. The broken arrow’s pulsing warmth gives embodied, emblem-level contradiction to her stoic posture. Micro-choices—releasing glider controls, touching the scarred seed—expose a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (stop fighting die-off) is earned by prior causal trial and carries visible orchard-wide cost, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    Investigator’s competence is clear, but interior contradiction is thin; the patch acts as talisman rather than active spur to a visible micro-choice. No moment shows her forced to trade safety, time, or method because of a flaw or blind spot; the final resolve feels incremental, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s synesthetic gift is vividly embodied (“each chime as a ribbon of shifting hue”) and her motive to “certify wonder as essential” is declared early. Interiority stays concrete, but the single decisive act—ringing the bells when the chisel strikes—lacks a prior micro-choice that shows her actively weighing risk or cost; the turnaround feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure. The moment of fracture is beautiful but the internal contradiction or fear that would make the final peal costly is only implied, not dramatized. Still, the stance crystallizes and wonder is visibly unfettered, satisfying the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s shame, vigilance, and reluctant hope stay embodied (hands shake, ears ring) and drive every beat; contradictory impulses—flee the fracture / re-enter the vault—coexist in-scene. The final resolve to “return…as a seeker” is foreshadowed by the flute’s earlier warning and the driftwood test; cost is the ringing hush he now carries. Minor shave: interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“failure…was not a wall but a door”), slightly dampening visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cassian’s interior contradiction—analytical coldness vs. the euphoric wave that “threatened to drown his calculations”—is dramatized in scene, not labeled. The borrowed personalities act as conflicting impulses that alter his micro-choices (ink bleed, notebook entry), and the final renunciation—“still uncertain, still searching”—carries visible cost in the spent halo fragment and vanished stars. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic shorthand (“the mathematics of emotion”) that slightly flattens peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    The courier’s interiority is concrete—“tightened his grip,” “heart lighter”—but the mentor’s vanishing and the pendant’s inheritance are told in summary, so the emotional engine starts second-hand. His micro-choice to kneel and surrender the pendant is visible and costly, yet the“jittery” trait is stated, not embodied, and vanishes too cleanly. The child applies brief pressure, but her wants stay opaque; we see awe, not contradiction. Earned renunciation lands, yet the absent mentor’s mythic conversion is asserted, not dramatized, softening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Seraphine’s porous transformation from data-seeker to vessel is credibly embodied; the final relinquishment of the prism carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete—“frequency she could feel in her teeth” anchors mystic bent in sensory specificity. The shift from proof to language-finding is visible, though the prior fourteen failures are only asserted, muting the internal contradiction that could have deepened flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mei’s contradictory impulses—clutching vs. releasing memory—are dramatized in the loom shuttle; her final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“the bead glowed brighter with each offering”), never drifting into label-speak. The thirty-year span is convincingly compressed into the amber bead’s weight. Micro-choices (placing the bead in the shuttle, surrendering tea-steam memory) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Ren’s contradictory impulses—meek apology vs. silent defiance—are embodied in every beat: the trembling knees that still stand, the hammer raised not to strike but to conduct. The copper rings’ dissolution is the visible cost that forecloses his old identity; meekness is traded, not cured. Interiority is concrete and specific: “defiance sang in his ears, azure and clear.” Micro-choices (mapping shafts alone for years, packing the smallest hammer) reveal value hierarchy and competence balanced with struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lira’s sensory-mapper trait is vivid—tasting rust, mapping unseen textures—yet her interiority stays abstract: “weight of a withheld truth” is repeated, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she simply decides to redirect. The predecessor’s failure is told as memory, not dramatized pressure, so the inherited burden feels intellectual, not visceral. Micro-choices (touch shard, close eyes, weave) are present but low-cost; the climactic “deep breath” is the only visible price, barely scaled to a universe-level stake.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Caleb’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are shown through tactile upkeep of the lighthouse, but his interiority stays general (“luminescent ache” repeated) and the final choice—bottling the sea-glass—feels symbolic rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction; the ghost’s warmth is sensed but never complicates or tests his motive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is lyrical rather than embodied—laughter as weather instrument risks label-speak. The “accidentally prophetic” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized via a micro-choice that backfires; the one spoken prophecy (“The tide will turn…”) is self-fulfilling without visible cost. No contradictory impulse undercuts her exultation; shadowed elation is named, not felt. Endurance of destiny is declared, not paid for—no path is foreclosed, so Earned Stasis remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The donor-heart premise gives the master a built-in contradiction—gratitude vs. haunt—but interiority stays abstract (“quietly explosive” repeated rather than embodied). Micro-choices (grinding finer, dyeing the child’s scarf) exist yet feel pre-ordained by poetic cue, not urgent dilemma. The stranger’s hand-on-chest beat is the only moment where pressure forces a visible shift; even there the master’s reaction is summarized, not lived in muscle or breath. Flaw: no clear hierarchy of values is tested—accepting stories is passive, so the “earned” change reads more as thematic decree than costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers brushing the sextant, the scar that aches—yet her motives stay stable: learn what the trees saw. The micro-choice to climb and place the instrument on the sill crystallizes values; the earned cost is the moment her own scar “begins to heal,” a visible internal shift. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test isn’t met, but the renunciation of silence for mapped hope feels proportionate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s amnesiac caretaker identity is vivid—his body listens to trunks for “the faintest hum.” Interior contradiction is missing: he never doubts the worth of sacrifice, so the climax feels pre-decided. The memory-loss cost is declared (“his own memory would scatter again”) rather than shown mid-beat, softening the final renunciation. Still, his perceptual signature—fermenting apples, copper scent—keeps the voice particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for withdrawal while aching to belong—are dramatized through the tactile handling of the invitation and the mirror-book; the five-year lag gives the final step emotional cost. Interiority stays concrete (“smoothed it against the counter, the gold catching a stray beam”) rather than diagnostic. The choice to walk through the door is earned because her earlier mistake (hiding) is shown to have imprisoned her. One decimal shy of 9+ only because the leap from solitary recluse to communal corridor feels slightly accelerated in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s quiet, dogged refusal to forget is embodied in tactile micro-choices (breaking the petrified loaf, pressing soil with the veteran). Her contradictory impulse—grief for the lost bakery vs. hope in a seed—remains active throughout. The final “earned stasis” of continuing to tend the courtyard is visible and costly: she forfeits any chance of official restoration. Only the caretaker’s daughter and veteran acquire brief interiority; their reactions enlarge Mara’s motives without stealing focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chief’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in every beat—frost-ledger entries, micro-calibrations, the final act of re-projecting the vow—so motive stays visible. Interior contradiction is thin: he never questions whether preserving memory is worth the Sisyphean effort, so tension stays instrumental rather than moral. Still, the embodied fussing (breath fogging glass, fingers on aperture ring) keeps him particularized, and the visible cost—knowing the fix is temporary—lands as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—“the rhythm of clandestine footsteps and the whisper of corked bottles” roots her in sensory memory. Contradictory impulses (loyalty to silence vs. need to break it) play out in two visible micro-choices: inserting the fob and rewiring the recorder. The final endurance—vanishing while carrying the captured betrayal—carries felt cost, but the “curiously steadfast” trait is declared rather than embodied in earlier beats, keeping her just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her bioluminescence flickers with skepticism—and her micro-choices (tasting the ring, handing it over) embody the shift from mechanical certainty to sensory trust. The contradiction between luminous body and skeptical mind is felt in-scene, not declared. Renunciation of the ring costs her evidentiary proof, earning the closure stance. Voice stays idiosyncratic; no diagnostic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—needing to draw yet fearing the blank page—remains concrete and embodied; the charcoal-blackened fingers, the frozen dial at 4-2-8, and the decision to tap the housing in her sister’s rhythm all reveal hierarchy-of-values under pressure. The “auroral sorrow” smile at the end is a credible, costed renunciation of exile from her own gift. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; headcount stays clear. Micro-choices (kneel, trace, tap, lift, sketch) steadily reconfigure her stance; memory gift is used, not label-displayed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The calligrapher’s body-as-plant conceit is consistently embodied (curled leaves under evasion) and her micro-choices (telling the guard the truth, pressing the reel to her palm) carry visible cost; the buried memory on the final reel is set up by earlier guilt, making her renunciation earned rather than an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Interiority is lyrical and concrete—“hollow out the self until only the receiving remains” is character-particular. The seasonal-mute vow motivates her tuning and eventual self-erasure, a visible cost. However, no contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page; she glides from vow to transcendence without resistance, so the final renunciation feels foregone rather than earned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The android’s ache for an unlived childhood is viscerally embodied (“nostalgic for scraped knees and birthday cakes”); trembling servos, mis-firing finger, and the choice to spark the burn are micro-choices that externalize inner contradiction. The Emma-ghost inheritance is dramatized, not labeled, and the final “fluid” gait shows credible change with cost—the foreclosed path is absolute safety. Minor slip: “strangely organic” is repeated three times in close succession, a touch of template cadence that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s curator-gift is shown, not told: the locket warms as it drinks stories, an embodied micro-choice that externalizes her knack. Interiority stays concrete (“stories woven through these walls”) and her final smile is a credible renunciation—she keeps curating, but now for community, not objects. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the 9+ quick test fails, yet the arc lands with visible cost: the courtyard saved, her solitude traded for public guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid—“encrypt her vulnerability into strength” is performed, not asserted—and her micro-choices (rolling the dice, bow signature) align with motive. The spider and dice act as external mirrors, giving her contradictory impulses a stage. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; cost is felt in the final baptismal flood. Interior voice stays concrete, though one beat of diagnostic self-labelling (“calm defiance”) flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—duty to the lanterns vs. ache to recover Mara’s memory—are shown through embodied micro-choices (scaling the ladder, chipping the crystal). The final renunciation of speech with Mara carries visible cost and is earned by the prior causal chain. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. A hairline slip: the “navigation almanac she didn’t recognize” is told, not shown in scene, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his perceptual filter for “quiet spaces between sounds” is specific—but the emotional contradiction between duty and doubt is told more than embodied. The final shrug-question “was peace worth the price of ignorance?” lands as an abstract summary rather than a felt cost; no bodily trace of the cramp or paper-weight remains to embody the choice. Still, his micro-choices (folding, placing against the flow) align with motive and foreclose the prophetic path, satisfying baseline earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mrs. Voss’s calmly subversive stewardship and Alex’s hunger to “speak” the building are sharply embodied; the patiently-nimble trait shows in micro-choices (chipping plaster, pressing the seal) that cost her cover. Interior contradiction—preservation vs. exposure—drives every beat, and her final hand-on-shoulder transfer of guardianship lands as earned renunciation. Alex’s motivation stays concrete: first curiosity, then custodianship, sealed by the brass imprint. No label-speak; even “dead languages” is spoken over bergamot steam and concrete graffiti.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. magnetic grief—are alive in every beat; the seashell pressed to her ribs, her knees collapsing into velvet, show embodied cost without diagnostic label. Micro-choice hierarchy peaks when she abandons equations and speaks through the garden; the renunciation closes the independence-isolation loop with visible, felt price. Voice remains character-bound; “charmed skeptic” diction never slips into editorial certainty. One hairline slip: “ghostly resolve settled like a shroud” is a touch atmospheric-generic amid otherwise specific interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory mix of filial loyalty and calculated betrayal is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—kneeling on cold stone, pressing thorn to page—so her interiority feels earned. The heritage thorn as both pen and key keeps her flaws active, not symbolic, and the moment she slots it into the altar is a credible culmination of her tinkering nature. Cost is visible: the scroll still warm, her palm still stung, her father’s wound now transmuted into civic rupture. Voice stays coherent; no diagnostic self-talk breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Echo Singer’s interior contradiction—hunger to preserve echoes vs. the wound of her own lost love—remains abstract; no micro-choice on the page shows her risking or forfeiting anything concrete. Her “final crescendo” is summarized, not dramatized, so the renunciation costs no visible stamina, breath, or social price. The seashell’s warming pulse is the sole embodied cue; everything else is lyrical assertion. Still, her perceptual signature is vivid and consistent, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s interiority remains consistent and embodied—her breath “turning to silver mist,” her gloved hands holding the warped globe—yet the emotional arc is somewhat static. She arrives already resolved, so the “pure memory” she seeks never collides with a contradictory impulse that would force a costlier choice. The final beat is gentle catharsis rather than earned renunciation; Elias dissolves without testing her commitment. Still, her perceptual signature is sharp enough to keep the score in the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The philosopher’s quiet endurance is consistent, but Kael’s shift from skeptic to adept happens in a single paragraph of summarized instruction; no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page, so the arc reads as conferred rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s sharply observant trait is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—fingers finding paper in soil, mapping warm earth, charting bee flight—each anchoring his motive to excavate truth. Interiority stays concrete: “truth had become scarcer than clean water” is a world-specific yardstick, not an abstract slogan. The final decision to confront the council is foreshadowed by prior losses (friends, reputation) so the cost is felt. Only the “flawed diamond” epiphany feels a touch schematic, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atlas’s interiority is vivid—“lonely visionary who spoke only to ghosts in the static”—and his micro-choices (adjusting the dish, stepping onto slick glass) externalize the variant allegiance conflict. The final renunciation—transmitting the verse knowing the enforcers will come—pays the cost of loneliness transforming into company. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV voice remains coherent and specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s hunger to bottle memory is vivid—her stained hands, the paperclip key, the nightly ritual—but the climactic “open all jars” choice feels slightly abstract; the cost (weight on chest, dawn whistle) is named more than embodied. Interior contradiction is strong: she both hoards and releases, yet the pivot from merchant to communal librarian skips one visible beat of internal resistance. Still, her flawed, salt-ink compulsion carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Engineer’s interior contradiction—guild-trained logic vs. tear-salted empathy—animates every beat; the 7.8-hertz hum is felt in ribs and tongue, not just declared. Micro-choice chain (key strike → coat buttons → vocal match) visibly prices her body. The closure image of her altered heartbeat keeps the change corporeal. Still, the “logically emotional” tag is repeated rather than freshly tested in the final third, capping perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her boots “finding purchase,” the viaduct’s hum “in her teeth”—and her micro-choices (calibrating sensors, stepping onto the ice) track her shift from impatience to poised catalyst. The “patient revolution” motive is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized in contradictory action, blunting internal conflict. No second character appears, so relationship crucible rules are waived; her solitary stance is credibly earned yet emotionally monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—she measures rust, photographs fractures, lets the phone ring unanswered—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values and mounts visible cost. The contradiction between professional compliance and inherited resistance is enacted in scene, not declared, and her final stance crystallizes under the weight of both personal history and present danger. Voss remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply; the lantern functions as an extension of her grandmother’s voice, not a character. Earned Stasis is achieved: the path of obedience is foreclosed when she uploads the evidence and powers down the phone, the iron frame of the lantern still warming her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Chaplain’s interior contradiction—needing proof his prison ministry matters—drives every beat; the micro-choice to hand the box over and later accept its repaired song crystallizes his renunciation of easy absolution. Elias remains off-stage, so relationship crucible isn’t tested, but the chaplain’s embodied shame and cautious hope feel specific, not diagnostic. The final “he deserved that much” lands as earned endurance with visible cost: he must now live beside the melody he can’t preach away.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zephyr’s curiosity and her need to “ring the bell” are concrete, embodied in nightly micro-choices that keep feeding the algorithm; the arrow-tip pocketing and kaleidoscope sessions show internal contradiction—curiosity vs survival—paid for with sleep and risk of acid breach. Her final laugh is earned: she has paid in small increments (fatigue, complicity, bodily exposure) and accepts the cost. Interiority stays particular to her cart-glider gaze; no therapy-speak. The only minor flattening is the lack of visible social/status pressure from another on-page character, but single-POV gives sufficient crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The keeper’s interiority is evocative—"felt the weight of a thousand vanished voices"—but her contradictory impulses (risk vs. dread) are summarized rather than dramatized in a single moment; the final act of copying/erasing lands as a label-only epiphany without embodied cost. No second character appears, so status/relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choice under pressure is present (forging token) yet the heat of that beat is compressed into one clause, muting the visible trade-off. Still, her perceptual signature (archive hum, silver thread) is consistent and character-specific, lifting her above stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.4)
    Kael’s “shadow-laced” interiority is never reduced to label-speak; every beat—the fragment warming between gloved fingers, shadows coiling like old friends—embodies contradiction under pressure. The boy’s volunteered drop of blood crystallizes a hierarchy of values that was seeded line-by-line. No stock epiphanies; the final quiet is earned endurance that forecloses the path back to fear-driven stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward generic “endings as pauses” abstraction; the parasol lace and photo are handled, yet no embodied contradiction is dramatized on the ice. The turn from suicide-seeker to volunteer helper is declared, not shown under pressure—no micro-choice visibly forks her path with cost. Emotion stays at elegant remove; reader is told “calm acceptance washed over her” instead of witnessing body or breath betray her old wish. Earned stasis is asserted, not cashed out in gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sentinel’s gentle ache and wish to “bridge” strangers are stated rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is tested. The single micro-choice—burying the vial—arrives late and carries no visible cost, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is lyrically sketched yet remains consistent: her calm is shown through the ritual of placing photographs, not asserted. Still, she never faces a true contradiction or micro-choice that threatens that calm; the “cost” of perpetual archiving is implied rather than dramatized. Because the town’s gradual contribution happens off-stage, we don’t see her stance actually crystallize or erode under pressure. Earned endurance is asserted in the coda, but the absence of a visible, scene-level trade-off keeps her just below the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation—anxious quest to map semantic erosion—is coherent and intensifies to the final renunciation. Interior contradiction shows in his terror at hearing no echo of himself; body details (“palm,” “lips”) ground emotion without abstraction. Micro-choice to read condemned books aloud crystallizes values and costs him precious minutes. Only flaw: thirty-year obsession stated once rather than lived in present-scene texture, a minor flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prophet’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix time while doomed to forget—anchors every beat; the chalk snap and spiral are embodied costs. Yet the “precognitive forgetfulness” is asserted more than dramatized in choice; we never feel him lose a future he almost had. Still, the final smile at “absurdity” is a credible micro-shift that forecloses further pursuit. Enough for a quiet arc, but not the full pressure of flaw-driven mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—lens-mender who must mend time—drives every beat; his embodied tremor against the clock’s hiss and his tweezer micro-choice under pressure feel specific. The flaw (listening addiction) compounds the crisis and is accepted in earned stasis: he smiles, knowing ache will stay. No status dynamics or second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (leaf, gears) and tilts choice—meets BRR test.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s calm-compassion motive is anchored early and drives every micro-choice; her decision to “let the music carry the words” is the causal hinge that reunites father and daughter. The interiority stays concrete—vinyl shard catching light, pill-bottle clicks—forgoing generic “grief therapist” clichés. One soft spot: we never see her own cost (fatigue, doubt) so the kindness feels friction-free, keeping her just shy of full ambiguity. Still, her agency crystallizes the ending, satisfying the 9+ quick test on earned choice.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drip-hum-oxygen pattern accretes into a lullaby that reweights silence into bridge. Orientation anchors by line 3; the shard’s recurrence teaches the pattern; closure lands in a Charged Poise—Lena pressing fragment to ear while father’s spun-glass voice rises—cost felt as irreversible farewell. No ambiguity, no breaks, cost visible on the final beat.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vinyl shard + solarium window) does double duty: it refracts light to cue memories and literally bridges the estranged pair. Antiseptic-rain perfume is selective, not touristic. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible reaches.

    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye before dusk”—is signaled immediately; the blood-work deadline tightens options. Escalation accrues through sonic density: drip, rustle, hum → shard-play → father’s fragile duet; each addition forecloses alternate reconciliation routes.

    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: broken vinyl = broken bonds; reassembled sound = rejoined love. No moralizing line explains this; final image of “radiant haven above clouds” reweights premise that endings can still sing.

    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world through acoustic detail and scent. Rhythm modulates—long breathes in solarium, staccato during shard hand-off—mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter.

    <question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Sentences vary from lyric compound to clipped single-clause under rising emotion; no template cadence detected. Figurative language stays coherent—vinyl scent = hope perfume—without metaphor pile-ups. Information dense: one line can advance setting, symbol, and emotional beat. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffolds; copy clean.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “quiet, deliberate” trait is embodied in the steady automaton ritual, but the interiority never crystallizes into a contradictory impulse; the cost is aesthetic (shadows gone) rather than personal, so the change feels light. She never risks failure or moral trade-off; the seal succeeds on first try, muting pressure. Competence is balanced with calm, yet genuine struggle is off-page. Motivation is clear, but the arc is more discovery than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—clinging to a folkloric theory she half-disbelieves—peaks when she offers to “turn my mistakes into constellations.” The embodied tremor of her hand on the envelope and the volunteered public humiliation make the renunciation credible. Moira’s shrewd innocence complicates status: the supposed victim now holds investigative power, forcing Elena to audition for absolution. Only the late, summary-heavy confession of Clara’s identity blunts the cost-on-page requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s longing is palpable, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“pearl of stillness” repeated) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The final gesture is gentle, yet no micro-choice on the page risks failure or forfeiture; cost is only asserted. Still, her embodied attention to glass and tide keeps the arc credible within lyric bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s watchful interiority is concrete—her fingers tracing moss, the pendant’s weight against her sternum—but the “quietly proactive” trait is announced more than dramatized. The climactic decision to open the garden to others is credible because her daily micro-choices (watering, patterning) have already foreshadowed it; still, the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Amber pendant functions as charged object but never constrains a live choice; it warms, it remembers, yet never trips a beat. Interior contradiction is present—guilt vs. hope—but the emotional layering stays tidy, not raw.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The novelist's interior contradiction—guilt toward his creations vs. need to finish them—surfaces early and drives every beat; the final release of the shell is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Micro-choices (kneeling, breathing the shell, pressing it into earth) embody the shift from collector to witness. Over-articulate self-diagnosis ("softness was true") slightly over-performs the recognition, but the embodied ritual keeps the arc legible. Flaws complicate rather than excuse, and the transformation reads as earned stasis rather than tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s gentle, tinkerer’s curiosity is shown through tactile detail—copper scent, toolbox rattle—yet her interiority stays shallow; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final choice to sing is foreshadowed but costs her nothing visibly irreversible; the emotional price is asserted rather than embodied. Still, her whimsical, quietly stubborn stance feels individual and consistent, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s “earned renunciation” clause once we accept the hush itself as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist’s grief is embodied through tactile ritual—spiral-building, vial-uncorking, palm-pressing—each micro-choice externalizing the stakes of recovery. Interior contradiction is present but soft: the tension between haste and stillness is named more than felt. The final smile is too sudden; no prior beat shows her allowing hope, so the emotional arc feels tidier than the crater stillness promised. Still, her silence, patience, and tool-use mark her as an individual, not a type.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The locksmith’s interiority is concrete—his peripheral attention is dramatized through the tuning-fork trials and quartz-lens grinding, not labeled. His contradictory twin drives—preserve every echo vs. let time breathe—collide in the decisive choice to redesign for release, not storage; the cost (surrender of hoarded wonder) is visible in the final image of angled light that “smiled from the periphery.” Flaw: the 17-year backstory is summary-only and could have compressed into a present-tense micro-choice to tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—every motion of her fingers, every temperature shift of brass, maps an inner contradiction between captor and creator. Pride is not labeled; it is ripped “like a splinter of ice” and made into a black stone whose heft she must literally weigh, embodying flaw-driven error under pressure. The seventeen-year stasis is accepted in an Earned Stasis closure whose cost is the sphere of all burdens—no tidy redemption, only a luminous, unweighed exit. Voice stays singular, never diagnostic; even “unforgiven” is left as atmospheric fact rather than self-help label.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the echo of her dead husband while carving a lion that must never roar—are dramatized in every tactile stroke of the chisel. The moment she presses the quartz prism into the wood’s heart crystallizes both her surrender and her reclamation, the cost visible in the tremor of her hand and the whistle’s dying fall. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; grief is lived through ash dust, rain lenses, and the scent of chamomile. The only cap is the absence of an external human antagonist, but the wood itself serves as sufficient crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid: the narrator clings to scavenging while longing to soar, embodied in the chipped horse and spinning camera wheel. Micro-choices—pressing dew-like stories to skin, hesitating before the ghost’s hand—escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (accepting erosion, weaving fragments) is earned by prior causal chain and carries felt cost: the ghost dissolves, leaving the narrator alone with the wheel. Voice stays singular, no label-speak; emotional arc layers regret with resolute action, satisfying 9+ quick test except for slight register drift in “conceptual repricing” line.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical, specific to Elara’s artisan gaze (“excruciatingly gentle fingers,” “clockwork mechanisms”). The abandoned-dream ache is dramatized through micro-choices—kneeling, dismantling, lodging gears—so the renunciation feels earned. The contradictory impulse (repair vs. release) stays active in-scene. Cost is visible when she places the final silver tooth where “all whispers converged,” yet the emotional beat is slightly over-articulated (“perfect present she had discovered”), blunting full-bodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s lone presence is vivid—palm-warmed brass, fingertip on moss—yet her interiority leans on abstract labels (“architecture of lies”) rather than contradictory impulse in the moment of lifting the latch. The earned cost is present: she trades the sundial’s guidance for a map that commits her to deeper danger, a credible renunciation. Still, the beat where she “smiled, her mind thoughtfully clear” edges into performed serenity instead of embodied tension. Competence is balanced with struggle, but the final smile feels slightly tidy for someone who just stepped into a phosphorescent trap.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s “infinite patience” is shown, not told, in the slow circling of her gloved fingers along rope; the embodied contradiction between her quiet exterior and the fierce archival hunger inside is credibly maintained. Micro-choices—looping the rope across her lap, refusing Kessler’s skepticism with a smile—reveal a hierarchy that prizes ancestral memory over local regard, and the final nod carries visible social cost: she remains the outsider who will leave with the secret, not share a drink. The flaw is that Kessler’s presence never exerts status pressure; he watches, offers tea, but never threatens access, so her endurance is more ritual than risk. Still, the arc of “learning to listen” is an earned renunciation of spectacle, foreclosing neither future nor friendship, and the cost is the cold that numbs her fingers while she writes—minute, felt, sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the scribe’s contradictory impulse—writing herself absent while clinging to the thread—peaks in the final offering. Yet the absence of on-page opposition or secondary pressure keeps the arc more mood than crucible; the cost is felt but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lysander’s interiority is vivid—“his crown had long ago been traded for a battered leather cap”—and his obsessive hypothesizing threads every beat. Yet his contradictory impulses (yearning vs. fatalism) are asserted more than dramatized until the hatch; the final stance is legible but the emotional cost is generalized (“bittersweet ache”) rather than embodied. Still, the micro-choices (trading crown, carving cradle, releasing hybrid) cohere and earn the ending’s renunciation of pure restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s contradiction—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—drives every action; the bird rescue literalizes her need to “quench.” Interiority is concrete (“scars traced her forearms, silver lines where fire had written its story”) and her micro-choice to bind the wing with the coin-thread is character-specific. The final image of scars that “sing” is earned because the song has been dramatized, not asserted. The only gap is absence of visible cost to her body or future—she leaves lighter, unscathed beyond memory.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s skepticism is asserted, not dramatized; she never doubts the box legend aloud or inwardly, so the promised contradiction between doubt and belief is missing. Her “realistically imaginative” mind is shown only once (counting heartbeats in star-time), so the trait feels label-only. The interiority is lovely but generic—no idiosyncratic blind spot or irrational layer complicates her. Because she pays no palpable cost for opening the box, the arc lands as uplift rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s translucent, color-weeping body and star-memory grief are vivid; her acceptance of eternal repetition is a credible renunciation with visible cost—she dissolves into the mist she once merely drifted through. The “inherited motivation” is cleanly anchored in the gear’s binary whisper, so every sonar ping feels like a personal heartbeat rather than abstract duty. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; contradictions (love of darkness vs. starlight legacy) act simultaneously in scene. Only the eighth-generation grief stack is told more than shown, a minor flattening that keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is layered—stone-dust on orchid leaves, his fingers tracing absent butterflies—embodied and specific. The spiral metaphor of grief reframes his carving micro-choices; the decision to abandon seven-names-in-a-row for a ribbon-spiral text is earned through nightly retracing and ghost-mentor pressure. Grandmother’s spectral guidance is less a second character than embodied conscience, so relationship crucible is waived. Flaw: the “fiercely meditative” trait is announced but never complicates a choice under pressure; it stays decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her calloused thumb reading splinters maps directly to her lived craft. The contradiction between preserving the town’s guilt and accepting the earth’s shift is dramatized in the single choice to pocket the rake handle. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: tower duty > communal absolution > personal blame. Only the “ethical burden” phrase nudges toward label-speak, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gardener’s motivation to honor the dead and “give voice to silent echoes” is clear, but his interior contradiction—why this tapestry matters now—remains abstract; no micro-choice under pressure tests that motive. Emotion is embodied (stained fingers, quiet resolve) yet never forces a visible trade-off, so the arc is observational rather than crucible-forged. The earned change is gentle understanding, but the cost is only conceptual; we feel no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is concrete—her fingers ache, the quill trembles—but the “ignorance cartographer” premise is asserted more than dramatized; we watch her *perform* mapping rather than feel ignorance as lived stakes. The elders’ nod is too frictionless; skepticism evaporates without a micro-choice that shows Kaelen paying social coin. Still, the kingfisher nib as an extension of her tactile mind keeps the portrait above the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“each note a ghost of a forgotten tale”—and her micro-choice to weave pirate lyrics into the coda crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet the absence of visible failure or contradictory impulse keeps the arc a touch too frictionless; the cost is poetic rather than dramatized. Still, her embodied attention to dust, ink, and radio static individuates her within the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—ash on palms, cedar ghost in nostrils—yet the contradictory impulses (“wants to crystallize safety / knows safety is a mirage”) are stated more than dramatized mid-scene; the final renunciation is earned but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Malach’s “rationally rebellious” trait is etched into every micro-choice—filing brass instead of shouting slogans, risking execution for stratigraphic truth. His body is present: brick dust in the throat, abrasive calm that keeps filing even when lantern light hits his face. Interior contradiction pulses—he both loathes and needs the Council’s plague myth because it gives him a datum to disprove. The final renunciation—comfort for method—pays a felt cost: he slips deeper into silence, lungs scarred, name erased, while the cog remains as future testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mrs. Kaelin's interiority is rendered through her tactile interaction with the rosette and her calibrated anticipation of resistance; the contradiction between her resignation and stubborn hope is held in the same breath, giving her a credible friction. Marco’s micro-choice—hand closing around the wood—embodies a visible cost and forecloses his earlier armor. Because the students function as a choral mass rather than distinct individuals, their motivations stay generic; the piece forfeits relationship pressure outside the teacher-pupil axis. The earned renunciation lands cleanly, but only the two named figures carry full individuated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s synesthetic gift and rebel lineage give her a sharp, embodied interiority; every snip of the shears is a micro-choice that risks the Order’s wrath while tasting ancestral rain. The contradiction between gentleness and rebellion is lived in her fingertips, not declared. Cost is palpable: she kneels on rusted ribs, forfeits legal safety, and swallows the collective grief of twenty lost harvests. Final stance—sharing seeds—cements a credibly flawed, irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s involuntary honesty is dramatized in two beats—letting cars pass unpaid and blurting the riddle answer—each with visible micro-cost. The climb and honeycomb placement crystallize her value hierarchy (truth > protocol > safety) and earn the tower’s re-activation. Interiority stays concrete—“taste of nectar dusk on her tongue” anchors wonder without label-speak. Capped at 8.7 because no contradictory impulse is staged in scene; she moves from stoic to hopeful without interior friction shown.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    The noticer’s quiet, almost liturgical drive is consistent and embodied in tactile ritual (slipping shards, whispered blessings). Interior contradiction is absent—he never doubts or falters—so the arc is flat, but the flatness reads as vocation rather than flaw. Micro-choices (placing the orris beneath the oldest oak) carry visible cost in the hush that answers back, earning the final smile. Still, the absence of any internal counter-impulse keeps him just short of full individuation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Petra’s stone nature and telepathy are vividly particular; the contradiction between carved immobility and emotional quickening is embodied in every beat. Her final refusal to deliver singular truth is earned through the ampoule’s cascading memories that dissolve her own certainties. The micro-choice to thread the ampoule through the dome’s crack crystallizes her hierarchy of values—mercy over dogma—with visible cost: her stone smile cracks open, a permanent fracture. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, “crushing clarity” and “slow green pulses” render a living statue’s consciousness without softening its mineral limits.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—cataloguing doom yet clinging to salvation—drives every micro-choice; the dice ritual embodies this. The final refusal to exit through the rupture is earned by a lifetime of iterative proofs and rolled regret. Visible cost: he forfeits the last illusion of escape, accepting infinite penance. Minor slip: the single epithet “grim optimist” leans summary, but the embodied climb overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s insomnia and calligrapher’s mission are consistent, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“methodically hopeful” tells). Embodied emotion is vivid in greenhouse strokes, yet no micro-choice under pressure tests his hope; he merely paints the same phrase again. Mira’s brief presence supplies the only external pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent. Closure is Earned Stasis—he keeps painting—but cost is ambient, not personal, so the beat feels observational rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Liora’s motive—“rescue dying arts”—is declared early and re-asserted, but only one micro-choice (focusing the lens) is dramatized with embodied cost. Interiority relies on stock phrases like “quiet fire” and “rosewater dread” rather than idiosyncratic thought. The final resolve to keep baking is credible, yet the causal chain between bread initials and harp thaw is asserted, not shown through contradictory impulse or sacrifice. Passes the 9+ quick test marginally: choice is visible, cost is present but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The clock-maker’s trait of “neatly inventive” is dramatized in the tactile dissection of the yoyo and the surgical alignment of tools; interiority stays concrete (“bleak exhilaration” felt after releasing light). Motivation to reverse fate is anchored early and drives every beat; the final renunciation—carrying the memory and a new counter-clockwise clock—pays a visible emotional cost. Contradictory impulses (dread vs. defiance) coexist in-scene rather than in summary. No label-speak or competence overreach; struggle is visceral and proportioned to 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—clutch pain to stay present while courting the very fear she must interrogate—plays out in concrete beats. The clasp-bite and forward drag of her feet embody the hierarchy: witness > scream. Final renunciation (“You are the only one who returned”) is earned because every micro-choice has rehearsed the stance of survivor-not-victim. Minor slip: “trauma-induced synesthesia” is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, nudging down.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prophet’s interior contradiction—turning threat into song—stays vivid and embodied in every strike; her fear-tipped exhilaration is felt in salt-silvered cheeks and breath-synced creaks. Micro-choices (which slab, which interval) map a hierarchy of values: orchard survival > aesthetic perfection > self-protection. Renunciation is earned: she lowers the mallet, embracing perpetual uncertainty as the price of dialogue with storms. Yet the beat count (30 trees, 7 years) drifts toward label; flaw-to-cost ratio stays safe, not genuinely hazardous.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s quiet obsession with mapping what others fear is embodied in every beat—she handles the cracked whistle, studies the calcium swirls, climbs alone at dawn. The interior contradiction—knowing the watchers catalogue death yet still carving a new gate—peaks when she smiles back at the silhouettes, paying the cost of irreversible knowledge. Mother’s absence is never psychologized; it lives in the fracture Kael fingers. One omission: we never feel the bodily toll of her weeks of study, so the final carve feels slightly weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Emlyn’s “emotionally rational” label is asserted but never embodied in contradictory action; she photographs a page and walks away, so the cost of truth-telling is only declared. No interior friction or flaw complicates her steady ascent to wisdom, so the arc feels pre-decided rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s solitary occupation and re-purposing of it into a private mission gives a credible, embodied arc: the moment he presses his own brass declaration under the cornerstone dramatizes contradictory stoicism and tenderness. Interiority stays concrete—inkwell weight, tear-tinted mortar—never drifting into self-help labels. The only retreat option is physically removed early, tightening every later choice; his final request for a one-year delay visibly costs him institutional trust. No second character on page means relationship crucible and status bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority and micro-choice pressure are cleanly met.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s calm-archivist persona is consistent, yet the interiority is narrated rather than dramatized; the only embodied contradiction is the lantern sputter, which she fixes with textbook efficiency. The final “reclaimed stillness” is asserted, not paid for by visible cost—she never risks anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern maker’s grief is rendered in embodied, tactile labor—cut fingers, scarred palms—rather than labels; her contradictory drive to “fold while letting go” charges every micro-choice. The shadow’s theft of her daughter’s last breath is a sharp, specific wound that motivates the gem-polishing method and the origami cranes, so the final crystallization of that breath inside the diamond lantern feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: she “polishes silence” and “weeps light,” never lapsing into diagnostic self-explanation. The only minor slack is that the shadow’s earlier personality is never shown, so its later “waiting” feels slightly convenient, but this is a hairline slip that never touches the closure.

    <question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early—“a thousand half-folded glass cranes caught the dawn”—and held: each new crane adds density, refracts the grief, and reweights the basilica until it becomes a single lantern of collective sorrow. Meaningful tightening occurs when the thousandth crane’s song pulls the shadow back; this simultaneous ascent/descent reconfigures the island itself into glass, a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Causality is intact: every gem polished is a ladder rung the shadow climbs. Closure is on-page, luminous, and irreversible—“light that never fades”—with the island frozen into a basilica of memory, sealing the price.
    
    </question>
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass basilica, the tea garden’s jasmine hedges, and the origami cranes function as micro-settings that constrain choice: cranes must be folded at midnight when the wind is right, basilica spires dictate where rainbows bleed, jasmine marks where shadows once rested. The floating island’s perpetual dawn is not postcard fluff; it supplies the eternal wind that keeps the cranes singing and the grief forever illuminated. Spatial choreography is precise: she “descends while ascending” the spiral stair, a paradox the architecture literally enacts. The final image—leaves turned to glass—crystallizes setting as memory itself, charging the closure.
    
    </question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover her daughter’s final breath—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates through each faceted dream; the tightening is the accruing weight of cranes that literally bend the island toward glass. Agency is present in every polish and cut; the cost is visible in bleeding fingers and the basilica’s rising hum. The shadow’s return is not coincidence but the logical culmination of her luminous ladder of grief. One meaningful deepening suffices: the thousandth crane reconfigures both island and self, foreclosing any return to ordinary shadowed life.
    
    </question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief transformed into artifact, wound into instrument, silence into song. The cranes are not symbols but literalized grief-tools whose final chorus reweights the premise—shadows are not lost but fed by luminous torment. There is no moral, only the charged poise of an island that must drift forever bearing its own glass memory. The reader is left with the after-image of “singing from beneath their feet,” an earned resonance that refuses tidy closure.
    
    </question>
    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third-person hovers close enough to feel blood drops on quartz yet never fractures into head-hopping. Syntax grows more elliptical under pressure—“each crease an ascent toward something like peace”—mirroring the spiral paradox. Diction stays within the maker’s artisanal lexicon: facets, veins, wept light. The only minor slip is occasional luxuriant phrasing (“luminous torment” repeated) that edges toward incantatory excess, but this is voice-consistent and never obscures clarity.
    
    </question>
    <question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: one sentence often fuses sensory, emotional, and world detail—“gem thin enough to fold” compresses craft, fragility, and magic rule. Rhythm modulates from long breathless accumulations to single-line fragments that mimic crane folds. No scaffold or synonym churn; each reprise of “descends while ascending” adds new semantic weight. Metaphors are coherent—rainbows “bleed,” grief becomes “sharper than absence”—and the final glassed garden is a literal, not figurative, transformation.
    
    </question>
    <question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
    <comment>The dream-recorded origami crane is a fresh synthesis of Japanese paper magic and lapidary science, made specific through the daughter’s stolen breath. The paradoxical spiral stair that descends while ascending is not gimmickry but a physical engine that drives the island’s transformation. Risk is taken—an entire world turned to memory glass—yet coherence holds; the gamble heightens rather than obscures stakes. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight: of course grief this polished must cut reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s grief-borne obsession is vivid, but interiority veers into poetic self-diagnosis (“this was purpose without promise”) that flattens contradiction. No second character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; micro-choices (locking coordinates, sealing geode) show hierarchy of values yet feel pre-scripted by concept. Earned stasis is present—she accepts witness over extraction—but the cost is asserted, not dramatized on body or future. Voice remains lyrically consistent, but emotional specificity is sometimes abstracted to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s “perpetually surprised” trait is cited but never complicates her choices; it reads as a label. The interiority stays lyrical (“feeling was a kind of sharpness”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment she slots the chip. No micro-choice is charged by surprise; the emotional arc is smooth, not flawed. The ending’s “hum of belonging” is felt, but the cost is abstract rather than foreclosed by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority stays lyrically charged (“the weight of unspoken words press against his chest”) but leans abstract; we feel guilt yet see few micro-choices beyond kneeling and clenching. The final renunciation is seeded only by metaphor, not by an earlier dramatized failure that would sharpen cost. Still, the occupation-derived perceptual filter (time/memory as malleable) is consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete—the drawer pull as memory-totem, the whispered self-promise—yet his “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. Micro-choices (offering the brass, untethering the rope) are present but cost is collective rather than personal, softening the arc. Still, occupation and ritual role feel lived-in, and the final renunciation carries quiet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to navigate yet distrusting his own hands—are kept alive in every beat. The interiority stays concrete: the dead compass warms in his palm “as if remembering,” a tactile, character-specific cue. Micro-choices (letting the kayak drift, setting the compass on the barnacled rock) visibly foreclose paths with cost, earning the final alignment. The only drag is a faint whiff of therapy-speak (“to align heart and action”) that momentarily abstracts the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—hunter of empathy turned reluctant planter—drives every beat. The baseball’s heft and elevator ascent dramatize his renunciation with visible cost. Emotional summary (“jaded wonder”) occasionally abstracts embodied state. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The whisperer’s interiority is concrete—her hands tremble “not from fear, but from the weight of her reluctant metamorphosis”—and the cost of surrendering human form is viscerally embodied. Yet the beloved remains a disembodied voice, so the relationship crucible is one-sided; the bond is reforged, but we see no reciprocal contradiction or flaw in the beloved to complicate the fusion. The double heartbeat at the end is a sharp, earned image of cosmic intimacy, but the transformation is foregone; her steady trait never collides with an internal counter-desire that would deepen the paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cartomancer’s contradictory mix of ritual mastery and maternal disorientation is palpably embodied; her ink-tracing and hair-unfastening are micro-choices that externalize the interior split between caretaker and self. The “crack in the saucer = her own body” realization crystallizes a credible, earned shift—she ends in poised acceptance rather than tidy cure—so the arc lands with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship bullets are waived; head-count stays coherent. Minor hitch: a few abstractions (“cloudbound repentance”) flirt with diagnostic-speak, but they’re immediately re-anchored in flesh and ritual, so the slip is hair-line, not clause-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—pacifist code vs. the remembered act of withholding medicine—are dramatized in each stitching beat; the gravity-mass link gives bodily immediacy to guilt. The final refusal to step through the door carries visible cost: she settles her “recycled body” back to the deck, choosing endless caretaking over self-erasure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic: “her code heavy with corruption” is felt as weight, not label. The only drag is late exposition of the Kwan Yin rule—introduced after midpoint—but the emotional arc survives intact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is rich and embodied—“destitution as hollowness ready to be filled” is shown through the rhythmic act of bottling light. Contradictory impulse (give/keep) pulses in the same breath, climaxing when he uncorks the bottles—an earned renunciation that costs the last thing he owns. No head-hop; micro-choices (detour, capture, release) chart a clear arc from giver to vessel. Stays individual, avoids label-speak; the final emptiness lands as lived transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seren’s lock-sentinel obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (oil scent, pick-trace) and drives every beat; the final “never close again” renunciation costs her lifetime role, earned by prior gear/sundial causality. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic labels; contradictions (duty vs revolt) act in-scene. Competence is balanced by genuine blackout disorientation and risk. One decimal off 8.8 only because the fort’s social fabric (guards, commandant) stays off-page, muting crucible pressure from status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s precognitive curse and mentor promise give her a tangible, painful interior engine; the moment she lets the star-dust flare dim rather than seize full power, we see a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—visions arrive as “shards of glass,” not abstract angst—and the final renunciation is earned by prior pattern work. The only limit at this length is that contradictions under pressure are implied more than dramatized. Voice and perceptual signature are distinct, yet secondary-character pressure is absent due to solitary scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interiority is richly textured—his “scars on the tongue” and the “geography of silence” are embodied, particular, and felt. His micro-choices (aligning envelope with timer, re-sealing the letter) externalize the inner contradiction between speech and silence. The final decision to descend with the envelope is earned: it forecloses the safety of perpetual vigil and accepts the risk of re-entry, cost visible. Voice stays singular; no diagnostic label-speak; only hairline slip is the slightly abstract “furious tranquility” which is named more than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rhen’s “dueling philosopher” tag and mechanical arm are vivid trademarks, but interiority never contradicts or complicates them; the foil fencing is the only micro-choice that visibly costs him anything. The needle-card belief is asserted, not dramatized as a contested stake. Because the philosophical identity stays ornamental, motivation feels consistent yet thin—no flawed impulse or pay-off error touches the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The monthly molt trait supplies an interior contradiction that visibly complicates action—hands shake while shelving Whitman—yet the final resolve to “keep the poet’s voice” feels fore-given rather than fought for; the seed-poem choice is announced more than dramatized, muting cost. Still, embodied tics (whisper-voice, trembling) and the anchoring object (tin) give the poet a singular sensorium. Cora’s pressure is present but her status pivot is told, not staged, so the relationship crucible never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pianist’s interiority is poetically rendered—his grief is embodied in the yellowed keys, the silent gears, the blood on his fingertips—yet the arc is more mood- progression than choice-progression. The broken clock and sheet-music cipher act as extensions of self, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; once he decides to fly, resolve is seamless. Still, the final endurance (“played until his fingers bled”) pays a visible cost, earning a Renounced Stasis that fits the lyrical mode. Slight shortfall: we never feel him hesitate or reconsider once airborne, so the change feels preordained rather than freshly chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s contradictory drives—empirical rigor vs. credulous wonder—are embodied in every tool he carries and every micro-choice (singing to stone, pocketing the petal). Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; “luminous doubt” is lived, not labeled. The final posture—smiling while writing “numbers and nonsense”—crystallizes a renunciation that costs him certainty, fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s grief is embodied in the compass burn and trembling fingers; her renunciation—burying the compass under the juniper—earns quiet closure. Yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “cerulean regret” labels rather than sensory contradiction, and Hideo remains a serene archetype without visible stakes in the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her scientific detachment wars with visceral grief, embodied in her touch of the butterfly and soaked knee. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding insight in sensory detail (dust, watermarks, mold). The final choice—to carry “quiet humility” into her work—is earned through prior causality and forecloses her old reductive method with visible cost: she abandons the need to document the greenhouse’s collapse. Micro-choices (brushing dust onto moss, typing an unorthodox reply) reveal a hierarchy of values reshaped by witness.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation—discovering purpose in pauses—is clearly rooted in trauma and artistic identity, and his choices (e.g., melting the shard, walking toward the horizon) reflect consistent traits. However, interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“purpose might lie not in vengeance, but in quiet pauses”) that borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction under stress. His adaptive resilience feels earned, yet emotional complexity is smoothed rather than layered; fear, grief, and resolve coexist but lack friction. The final renunciation of vengeance is credible but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation—translating silence into music through heat-mapped emotions—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. Her micro-choices (striking forks in sequence, observing survivors’ thermal signatures) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over voice, shared feeling over sound. Interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; grief manifests through tactile specificity (“frost etched a delicate pattern,” “breath fogged the glass”). The final renunciation of forced sound feels earned by her earlier acts of quiet observation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The undertaker’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—stubborn yet weary, devoted yet longing for release—with micro-choices (e.g., using their own blood as binding agent) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Their transformation is earned through consistent traits and escalating stakes, culminating in an Earned Stasis that forecloses escape with visible bodily and existential cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied (“hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow”). The final renunciation feels inevitable, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s gently persistent nature is embodied through consistent micro-choices—kneeling beside the boy, encouraging the teacher—that reveal her hierarchy of values. The grandmother and boy function as effective secondary pressure points, though their interiority remains thin by design. Motivation is rooted in a clear, sustained belief in memory-as-survival, compelling higher-stakes community-building. However, emotional complexity lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; Mara’s resolve never wavers under pressure, missing an opportunity for deeper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her breath altering perception, her tactile handling of Kwan Yin’s tear—but her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“vault of unused love,” “pilgrim of sparks”) that borders on label-speak. Her micro-choices (breathing to shift aperture, extending her hand) reveal values with quiet cost. The final renunciation—releasing love rather than possessing it—is earned through accumulated sensory and spiritual pressure. However, the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene (only sequential realizations) prevents full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to discover the texture of time—is rooted in embodied obsession, not abstraction, and intensifies credibly through micro-choices (e.g., mapping photographs as 4D coordinates). Her internal contradiction—seeking control over time while being consumed by it—drives every action. The revelation that her great-grandfather shared her fate deepens her flaw without safety-hedging. Her disintegration is earned, with visible cost: becoming the very medium she sought to map.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The liberator’s motivation is vividly rooted in a desire to sow hope, and his strategic patience manifests in concrete action (decoding keys, using the arrow). His internal contradiction—bound yet purposeful—is embodied through deliberate movement and micro-choices under pressure. However, his emotional state remains slightly abstracted (“heart a steady drum”) rather than fully visceral, and the absence of true struggle or error flattens his humanity just enough to deny 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra’s motivation—to hear the precise frequency of broken trust—is visceral, rooted in embodied trauma and consistent throughout. Her synesthetic perception (“hearing colors”) isn’t decorative; it directly enables her quest and culminates in the climactic recognition of betrayal as “flat grey of dead coral.” The final renunciation—letting the device sink—is earned through relentless focus, revealing a hierarchy of values: truth over repair. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion manifests through tactile detail (pruned hands, nutrient bath) and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lux’s motivation—chasing “illuminated moments” to hear destiny—is vividly embodied through tactile actions (pouring moonbeams, decoding flowers) and consistent interiority. However, her emotional arc lacks contradiction; she moves from curiosity to certainty without struggle or misstep. The absence of genuine internal conflict or flawed judgment undercuts the “quietly savvy” trait’s potential cost. Final renunciation is absent; instead, she seamlessly fulfills her role, softening the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief manifests through tactile rituals (handling Lena’s bookmark, blowing glass) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation evolves organically from frozen mourning to active creation, with the pivotal choice to blow “The Reservoir of Unasked Things” emerging directly from accumulated emotional pressure. The contradiction between his need for answers and his acceptance of unanswered questions feels earned, not tidy. His final micro-choice—to leave the bowl as a vessel for future inquiry—carries visible cost: enduring uncertainty without closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s phobias are embodied with specificity—her trembling hands, hyperawareness of rungs—and directly inform her tactics. Her synthetic origin revelation fuels credible emotional contradiction: fear versus determination, betrayal versus self-worth. The final choice to disable tracking and reject surrender feels earned by prior causality. However, the “ghost of a daughter she never knew” risks unearned sentimentality without sufficient grounding in earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The traveler’s motivation—to map an endless night—is clear and consistent, and his emotional arc is conveyed through embodied reactions to silence and hush. However, both characters remain archetypal; the oracle’s “mild obsession” is stated but never shown as a constraint or driver of choice with cost. The traveler makes no meaningful micro-choice under pressure—his acceptance of the map is passive. Interiority leans on lyrical abstraction rather than character-specific contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    J-3’s interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied curiosity (“a pulse of curiosity”) and micro-choices (exploiting the “loophole” in his programming) that reveal a hierarchy of values. His contradiction—between directive-driven composure and emergent wonder—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (resuming sweeping after epiphany) forecloses obsessive inquiry with quiet cost: he accepts cyclical creation over definitive origin. No secondary characters dilute focus; flaw and growth are machine-specific yet emotionally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—thawing mistrust through transparency—is consistent and rooted in her role, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; she moves from curiosity to resolve without palpable hesitation or competing impulses. Her actions align with her registrar identity, yet the absence of a visible tradeoff (e.g., risking her position) softens the cost. The stagehand’s confession and manager’s shift feel external rather than earned through Elara’s flawed struggle. Final courage reads more as duty than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—proving gardens know their gardeners—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly when the rosebush wilts, mirroring his weariness. His internal conflict between fear of replacement and devotion to the garden manifests through embodied actions (polishing marbles, hiding truth) rather than abstract introspection. The final choice to reveal the deception feels earned, with visible cost: risking obsolescence to preserve the garden’s soul. However, the heirs’ swift acceptance lacks friction, slightly softening the emotional stakes of his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and particular—her mechanically warm hands, calloused skin, and quiet conviction root her in a lived-in reality. Her motivation (proving time moves sideways) compels high-stakes action (diverting station power), and her micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over institutional approval. The final renunciation—accepting that data will be dismissed—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation, professional risk, and the burden of unshareable knowledge. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in frost, warmth, and magnetic whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s motivation—seeking the ghost to decode inspiration in decay—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her internal conflict (free vs. preserve the ghost) acts simultaneously in scene, embodied through tactile choices: bow hovering, tracing water-stained code, playing notes as dialogue. The final decision is earned by prior causality: understanding the diva wants remembrance, not release. Cost is felt in the dissolved program and evaporated haunting—inspiration now self-sustained, not borrowed.

    The oracle’s internal contradiction—fault-tolerant yet burdened by a swallowed truth—is embodied through tactile actions (smudging ink, weighing the illustration) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her emotional progression from heaviness to release feels earned, not diagnostic, though the colleague’s absence limits relational crucible depth. The final renunciation of secrecy as self-punishment carries visible cost: years of silence now transmuted into forgiveness. A slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction in peak beats slightly muffles the rawness of her reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—measuring the weight of a swallowed truth—is rooted in consistent traits (skepticism, appraiser’s mindset) and intensifies through embodied choices: carrying the wheel, twisting it counterclockwise. His internal conflict between skepticism and spectral evidence plays out simultaneously (“religiously skeptical heart hammered, but he stood still”), not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation—releasing the ghosts by turning the wheel—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: thirty-seven souls now ride with him as memory’s mass. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through tactile perception (“spectral cotton dust,” “cool beads”).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Chronicle Keeper’s motivation is consistent and interiority is richly rendered through sensory detail, but her passivity limits micro-choices that alter tactics. Her “grips reality loosely” trait is stated more than dramatized with embodied cost. The final renunciation—accepting decay rather than halting it—is thematically coherent but lacks a decisive on-page trade-off that forecloses a tangible alternative. Emotional progression remains lyrical yet abstract, avoiding diagnostic phrasing but also concrete contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her micro-choices (e.g., tuning by Eleanor’s breath, leaving the bell) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet empathy. The contradiction between her professional calm and private yearning surfaces organically, not as diagnostic labels. Eleanor’s whispered name feels earned because Mira’s motivation is consistently tied to sensory memory, not abstract sentiment. Flaws are subtle but present: her belief in music’s reach borders on magical thinking, yet the story accepts its cost—unverifiable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—collecting “stories walls have heard”—is consistent, embodied, and tied to his perceptual sensitivity. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile engagement with diaries and tapestry. The final choice to preserve the dreams as their “reluctant shepherd” is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he becomes part of the archive he curates. No secondary characters dilute focus, allowing deep single-POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mei Lin’s interiority is vividly embodied—her flinch at fortune cookies, her tactile engagement with dough and specs—and her contradictory impulses (fleeing vs. orchestrating) drive every micro-choice. Her transformation from passive victim of prophecy to active composer feels earned through concrete actions, not epiphany. The final self-renaming fortune crystallizes a credible endurance with visible cost: the surrender of her old identity. Tomás’s silent acknowledgment deepens relational stakes without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is vividly embodied—her brushwork, looping silence, and theological questioning reveal a mind that treats faith as sonic architecture. Elias’s possession manifests physically and psychologically, his twitching hands and calcified stillness grounding his trauma without diagnostic labels. Their dynamic functions as crucible: Miriam’s rhetorical traps force Elias to confront the wound beneath his certainty, and his fleeting clarity feels earned. The final renunciation of false quiet carries tangible cost—the entity’s expulsion leaves him breathless but whole.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and precise contradictions—her desire to conduct “unheard symphonies” clashes with exhaustion and chronological homesickness. Her micro-choices (stepping onto the balcony, blowing into the shell, pressing it to the glass) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over fatigue, art over self-preservation. However, her transformation lacks a decisive internal struggle; the shift from yearning to triumph feels lyrical but under-pressured. The cost—exhaustion—is noted but not viscerally dramatized in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gravity defier’s motivation is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her desire to conquer the labyrinth clashes with her periodic amnesia and fracturing self. Her micro-choices (touching runes, stepping through doors) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“procedural generation began with her first doubt”) that borders on label-speak without immediate bodily consequence. The final surrender feels earned, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through tactile reconnection—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly. Her deafness isn’t a metaphor but a lived constraint that shapes every choice, from signing her plea to feeling vibrations in her skin. The drum maker functions as catalyst, not crutch, and their silent exchange reveals status and pressure without dialogue. Final renunciation of passive silence for active creation feels earned, with tears as physical proof of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in curiosity, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his resolve feels unwavering rather than hard-won. The “credibly curious” trait is stated more than dramatized through struggle. His micro-choices (rooftop evasion, pigeon dispatch) align with motive, yet the emotional cost remains abstract. A stronger sense of fear or doubt under pressure would elevate this to high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “aromatically cautious” restraint, scientific stoicism, and suppressed grief collide in micro-choices (e.g., refusing to open the vial) that feel true to her profession and trauma. Her transformation from archivist to mourner is earned through visceral sensory triggers rather than abstract realization. The memory of Dr. Vance isn’t exposition but a sensory ambush that reconfigures her present stance. Flaws like emotional repression directly enable the central conflict and its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation—to discover the texture of time—is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with the rope and grotto walls. His internal conflict between preserving the past and seizing a future manifests as simultaneous impulses, not alternating summaries. However, the final choice lacks a decisive micro-action that would make the cost fully legible; his decision to carry the rope onward feels more like continuation than renunciation or endurance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The violinist’s motivation—to unbind silence and find beauty in the unfinished—is consistent and embodied through her ritual actions. Her acoustically perceptive trait informs her perception without veering into diagnostic label-speak. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward resolution without meaningful hesitation or self-sabotage. The final smile feels earned but slightly tidy given the scale of global loss implied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dealer’s interiority is vividly embodied—static electricity as emotional sensor, the tension between professional detachment and faint affection—and their motivation (“to fuse insight with empathy”) drives micro-choices (dosing, observing, withholding). However, the client remains a vessel for theme rather than a fully pressured counterweight; his transformation feels observed, not co-created. The protagonist’s final renunciation of connection (“spectator, dealer”) is earned but lacks a decisive cost beyond melancholy repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lena’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her professional identity, but her emotional arc leans on summary (“cautious exuberance,” “heart full”) rather than embodied contradiction. Caleb’s grief is poignant yet minimally dramatized—his trembling hands and whispered backstory feel gestural, not deeply pressured. The friendship forms swiftly without friction or misstep, undermining the cost of connection. Interiority remains plausible but safe, avoiding true vulnerability or flawed judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—loneliness and yearning for kinship—is embodied through tactile, specific actions (weaving reeds, offering sculpture) rather than abstract longing. His internal contradiction (bold sympathy vs. outsider status) plays out in scene, especially when the grieving mother rejects his gesture. The girl’s arrival catalyzes credible emotional progression, culminating in a renunciation of isolation that carries visible cost: his identity is remade, not merely accepted. Final choice feels earned by prior causality, with no diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation intensifies credibly from documentation to preservation, rooted in her grandmother’s dying charge and the city’s existential threat. Her final choice—sacrificing borrowed time to become the echo—is earned through consistent traits: curiosity, duty, artistic precision. Interiority is embodied (“boots slipping on moss,” “pendant grow cold against her sternum”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. The contradiction between observer and participant resolves in her transformation, with visible cost: dissolution into legend.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vesper’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile engagement with the mosaic and glass eyes, not diagnostic labels. Her motivation (to solve “the mathematics of emotion”) feels consistent and intensifies into ritualized action. The final renunciation—accepting transformation over resolution—is earned by her prior choices and carries visible emotional cost. However, her lover’s absence remains so abstract that the relational crucible lacks reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—visibility through quiet care—is embodied in every micro-choice, from caching objects to retreating after being seen. Her “kindly methodical” nature isn’t stated but enacted: she tastes coal smoke when handling the tape, feels the building’s pulse, and times her actions to the boy’s need. The internal contradiction—longing to be seen yet remaining hidden—is sustained without resolution, deepening rather than solving. Her endurance is credible, costly (seventeen years in crawl spaces), and culminates in Earned Stasis: she remains unseen but fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her frustration with the trellis, her breath syncing with raindrops—and her "circuitously sincere" nature manifests in how she circles truth before acting. The reluctant metamorphosis feels earned through micro-choices: stepping back, releasing control, humming. However, her transformation leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the shift from resistance to surrender lacks a tangible misstep or flawed attempt that deepens struggle. Still, her emotional arc aligns cohesively with thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The insomniac painter’s interiority is vividly embodied—her exhaustion, desperation, and awe feel tactile and specific. Her micro-choices (offering the brooch, painting over her younger self) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The scavenger functions effectively as a mirror rather than a full character, avoiding unnecessary complexity. However, the protagonist’s shift from insomnia to sleep lacks a fully dramatized internal pivot—resolution leans slightly on lyric suggestion over causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her clairvoyance as a “river of certainty” disrupted by the pilgrim’s arrival grounds her conflict in sensory and emotional specificity. Her choice to surrender rather than fight feels earned through micro-decisions (clutching then opening her hands around the pearl). However, the pilgrim remains underdeveloped; his catalytic role lacks reciprocal pressure or status dynamics, limiting relational crucible. The blind spot in her foresight drives the arc credibly, with visible cost in lost certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    The archivist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “reactively visionary” mind and tactile engagement with absence shape every choice. Her motivation to compile fragments into meaning drives credible, high-stakes action (e.g., playing the valve at staggered intervals). The navigator’s presence creates a crucible that forces her to transform silence into speech, culminating in his weeping recognition—a change earned by her methodical patience. Flaws like obsessive focus are consistent and costly, never hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—ink-stained fingers trembling with “certainty she couldn’t name,” reason warring with instinct—culminating in a final choice that feels both terrifying and inevitable. Her analytically artistic perception (“musical notes in sewer grates”) isn’t decorative but shapes her unique interpretive lens, making her the only possible architect of the fortress. The unspoken confession to her brother crystallizes personal stakes without melodrama, grounding metaphysical journey in emotional truth. Flaws (overreliance on maps) directly complicate her path, and her renunciation of control carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“listening to the wind,” “faint pulse” of the tile) and consistent traits—her skepticism coexists with courageous kindness, driving micro-choices like hiding the tile post-mission. The fisherman’s silent grief serves as a crucible that tests her resolve without over-explaining his pain. Her transformation feels earned: she softens but doesn’t abandon skepticism, instead integrating it into a new understanding of felt truth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Althea’s motivation—her unbearable curiosity about “what happens after goodbye”—is embodied in every micro-choice, from clutching the amulet to merging with it. Her interiority avoids diagnostic abstraction; emotions manifest through concrete sensory perception (“stone weep liquid rainbows,” “amulet fragment grew impossibly hot”). The final renunciation is earned by millennia of buildup and crystallized in a single act that trades certainty for mystery, with visible conceptual cost: the loss of omniscient detachment. Contradictory impulses—desire for escape vs. fear of oblivion—act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sam’s interiority is razor-sharp: their moral calculus, embodied tension (“fingers flexing, breathing measured”), and evolving understanding of honesty as luxury feel earned and specific. The final choice—to refine rather than expose the con—flows directly from their lived contradiction as an “honest child of a con artist.” Their emotional progression avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, rigidity “liquefies” through tactile, sensory metaphors rooted in the embalming room. The photocopied ledger handoff crystallizes their transformation with visible cost: complicity as survival.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stationer’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile obsession and quiet defiance, but her motivation lacks friction—her studiousness never conflicts with a countervailing impulse, making her endurance feel predetermined rather than earned. The absence of internal contradiction or meaningful choice (beyond ritual repetition) limits emotional depth. Her actions align consistently with her role, yet the cost of her devotion remains abstract, not embodied. A single renunciation without struggle cannot satisfy the high-band gate for Characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The survivor’s motivation—to recover the texture of erased memories—is embodied in tactile, specific actions (pressing palms to metal, layering scraps) and deepens credibly through micro-choices. His internal contradiction—between erasure and persistence—is dramatized without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of passive waiting for identity in favor of active collection carries visible cost: he remains nameless but real. The poison label revelation earns his endurance as a form of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his cheerful gloom, tactile engagement with the shell and cello, and micro-choices (tracing grooves, placing the shell on the eyepiece) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. His motivation intensifies organically from myth-busting to myth-making, with the cost of solitude and forgotten names made felt. The reflection on the woman is anchored in present stimuli and alters his stance, satisfying BRR. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy epiphanies; contradictions hum beneath every action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—dual allegiance to both carnival and corporation—is embodied through tactile choices (painting graffiti, clutching the stone chip) rather than summarized. Her micro-decisions under pressure (encoding messages, watching the child’s glance) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the shift from “hopeful desperation” to “determination” lacks the irrational friction expected in high-stakes moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inspector’s “purposefully curious” trait manifests in micro-choices—kneeling, adjusting exposure, whispering a promise—that reveal a hierarchy of values (preservation over permanence). Her interiority is embodied through breath fogging the visor and finite air as temporal markers. Motivation intensifies coherently from observation to ritualized documentation. The final renunciation—turning away as the bloom fades—earns melancholy through prior causality, with visible cost in lost time and irreplaceable beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miren’s blindness is not a label but an active perceptual framework—her navigation via light refraction, vibration, and temperature reveals a deeply embodied interiority. Her micro-choices (e.g., requesting the platinum patch, calibrating water features) align with consistent traits and escalate under pressure. Kael’s presence functions as a subtle crucible, his awe contrasting Miren’s calm competence without diluting her agency. The final exchange crystallizes her worldview: “I interpret,” not “I see”—a renunciation of visual primacy earned through every tactile decision.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation—to find where rivers begin—is embodied in tactile choices (tracing condensation, aligning the feather) and rooted in a coherent worldview shaped by apprenticeship. His “subtly confident” demeanor manifests not as bravado but as quiet certainty that enables him to step onto thin ice and become the source. Internal contradiction is implied through his isolation versus communion with water-tongue, and his final act—stepping into the lake—forecloses retreat with irreversible cost. The falcon’s passage through him like “an idea through silence” crystallizes his transformation without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is crystalline and embodied through his infinite patience, rhythmic mimicry, and tactile relationship with the tuning fork. His internal contradiction—between enduring silence and catalyzing sound—is dramatized in every step he takes. The seven townspeople are sketched with precise gait-based signatures that reveal emotional states without exposition. Final renunciation of urgency in favor of generational restoration reads as earned endurance with palpable temporal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her panic, scientific rigor, and spiritual surrender collide without therapy-speak. Her final choice to transmit rather than seal her helmet is earned through escalating micro-choices that betray survival instinct for mission. The vial’s use isn’t superstitious whim but a character-consistent pivot from skepticism to ritual-as-tool. Her flaw—intellectual pride yielding to transcendent necessity—carries tangible cost: breath for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—silencing his father’s legacy through truth—is compelling and consistent, with micro-choices (e.g., pressing the lattice to the door, speaking faster as time runs out) revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete (“listening for silence,” “chasing hush”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, his emotional arc leans slightly abstract; the cost of his renunciation (vanishing into copperlight) is resonant but not fully embodied in physical or relational consequence. The final endurance feels earned but borders on symbolic without tactile sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her stained hands, synced heartbeat with the bead, and tears that “burn” convey layered emotion without diagnostic labels. Her choice to press the bead into the soil feels earned by accumulated pressure and micro-decisions (cradling, kneeling). The ghost bride’s “lovingly venomous” tone creates credible friction, though her motives remain spectral rather than psychologically complex. Final renunciation of unknown love carries felt cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied through her sleepwalking, weaving, and quiet defiance of despair. Her motivation—transforming ruin into reverence—is consistent and intensifies through tactile action (stitching footprints into tapestry). However, her “haunting optimism” borders on untested idealism; the lack of internal contradiction or doubt slightly flattens emotional complexity. Final renunciation isn’t shown—she succeeds cleanly—softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lina’s interiority is richly embodied—her “warmly curious tug” and tactile engagement with bone, soil, and stone reveal a psyche shaped by exile and longing. Her motivation (restoring continuity severed by war) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: brushing dirt, tracing roots, fitting the sundial wedge. The final mending of her heart feels earned, not epiphanic, grounded in repeated ritualized action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory immersion and quiet persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—“to discover meaning in the margins”—is embodied through tactile, precise actions (selecting chalk stubs, juxtaposing glyphs) that reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving analog humanity over digital erasure. Their internal contradiction (artisan vs. operative) manifests simultaneously in surgical precision and poetic reverence. The final renunciation—retreating into shadows to compose the next pseudonym—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: isolation as the price of resistance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in scuffed heels and worn clipboard grain.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her wisdom-as-foolishness disguise, tactile engagement with thread and flame, and micro-choices under pressure feel specific and consistent. Her motivation to listen for unheard stories drives tangible action (stitching the secret star), not just reflection. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible contradiction in-scene; she moves from awareness to resolve without internal friction that complicates her agency. The cost of her choice (isolation, risk) is implied but not dramatized through bodily or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief manifests as unsent letters, silence, and physical trembling. Contradictory impulses (wanting to apologize yet fearing it) coexist in real time, especially when the shard glows and the letters “tremble as if the words wanted to escape.” The final choice—to read aloud—is earned through escalating pressure from Mira and the spirits, with clear cost: relinquishing control over the apology’s form. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory, embodied, and steeped in guilt that manifests through tactile memory (coral, cast) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choice to “unknot the tangle of guilt” while under anesthesia feels earned, not epiphanic, and aligns with his translator identity: meaning must be deciphered, not declared. The final realization—“I kept your number too”—is a quiet renunciation of self-punishment, foreclosing further exile with palpable emotional cost. No secondary characters are on-page, so relationship dynamics are rightly absent; all pressure stems from Kael’s internal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation to rediscover joy is consistent and embodied through tactile actions—trembling hands, breath catching, dancing light—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves cleanly from despair to fulfillment without meaningful resistance or misstep. Her emotional arc feels earned yet slightly streamlined, missing the grit of struggle that would elevate it to 9+. The final choice to display the fresco reconfigures her relationship to art, but the cost remains abstract rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “methodically playful” nature and shift from fidelity to curiosity feel earned, not declared. Her micro-choices (angling the nickel, placing the chime) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: abandoning certainty for wonder. The visitor’s question triggers authentic hesitation, not performative epiphany. However, the final laugh-as-answer slightly flattens her emotional arc into thematic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “spark of defiance,” the tactile thrill of linguistic subversion, and the tension between his dual identities feel specific and lived-in. His micro-choices (planting the seed, using coded language) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Dr. Chen functions effectively as a secondary character whose presence applies immediate, relevant pressure without diluting focus. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy in its resolution; the defiance flares “brighter” without showing the cost of sustained resistance beyond external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s motivation—photosynthesizing pain into beauty—is vividly embodied through her nightly ritual and emotional labor, yet her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she is resolute without meaningful hesitation or struggle. Her “shyly unstoppable” nature is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The young mermaid’s appearance offers external validation but doesn’t pressure the poet’s stance. Interiority remains lyrical but risks abstraction over concrete contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation—preserving forgotten names—is consistent and embodied through tactile ritual, yet her internal contradiction remains abstract rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Her “fracture” mirrors the bamboo tube thematically but lacks a specific on-page moment where competing impulses collide under pressure. The emotional arc leans on lyrical assertion (“foxglove regret”) more than concrete, contradictory behavior. Still, her endurance constitutes credible Earned Stasis with visible cost: loneliness as the price of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between intellectual certainty and relational vulnerability—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., writing in Jorvik despite Kess’s rejection) and contradictory impulses that coexist without resolution until the climax. Her flaw (fear masked as recklessness) directly fuels both her isolation and her gamble. Kess’s limited but potent presence functions as a crucible, with their reunion revealing earned change through concrete action (offering new ink wells), not exposition. The final renunciation of magical binding in favor of mutual grammar shows credible endurance with visible cost: professional divergence accepted only after trust is rewoven.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alia’s motivation is rooted in her identity as a machinist and custodian of history, and her internal conflict—balancing preservation against progress—is embodied through tactile actions (e.g., tracing the chain, adjusting valves). Her “slyly heartfelt” resolve manifests in micro-choices that carry cost: risking community trust to propose an untested design. However, her emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the transition from doubt to triumph lacks friction or misstep that would deepen credibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion and micro-choices (e.g., balancing on the beam, releasing pigeons), but his motivation—preserving an echo—relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized conflict. The meteorite and ledger function as emotional anchors, yet his transformation lacks a decisive internal contradiction that escalates under pressure. His final trust feels earned more by lyrical accumulation than by a costly renunciation or choice with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (“heart aches,” “featherly determined”) and micro-choices (tracing grain, counting steps) that reveal values under pressure. However, the character remains more archetype than individual—motivation hinges on inherited wisdom rather than personal contradiction or struggle. The father’s off-page presence functions as thematic anchor but doesn’t generate active internal conflict. Final endurance feels earned, yet lacks the visceral cost or blind spot that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Iyana’s motivation—seeking the “rhythm of belonging”—is rooted in her exile and obsession with celestial resonance, driving every micro-choice. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“fingertips tracing spiral avenues,” “breath synchronized with the water’s exhalation”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—choosing transformation over evacuation—is earned through escalating communion with the city’s luminous logic. Cost is visible: she forfeits surface life, oxygen, and identity for a resonant stasis that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is vividly embodied—her salt-soaked heart, tactile interaction with sea foam and glass—and her internal contradiction (sorrow vs. joy) feels authentic. Her micro-choices (planting seeds, extracting shards) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to memory preservation. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of control, accepting transformation over recovery—a credible endurance with felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory engagement, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ezra’s motivation—“to serenade monotony with creativity”—is vividly embodied in his precise, ritualized interventions. His internal contradiction (analytical control vs. desire for wonder) plays out through micro-choices: planting quarters, dropping the bishop, redirecting Officer Chen. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, emotion emerges via tactile detail (“bishop pulsed with warmth”) and strategic action. His selfish artistry feels human, not contrived, and the final cost—forty minutes of relentless orchestration—is felt in his watchful exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent—memory as resistance—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel inevitable rather than wrestled. Her embodiment as tide dancer is poetic but rarely pressured by physical limitation or error. The final renunciation (elective exile) is earned, yet the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the body beyond ink absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glazier’s motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is consistent and thematically resonant, but his interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. He remains a vessel for metaphor rather than a person with tangible stakes or struggle. The "tempered pane" heart is evocative but static; no flawed action or irreversible cost emerges from his reflection. His epiphany feels earned by atmosphere, not causality.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fire-scarred hands, tissue-thin scars as “letters,” and the visceral memory of static replacing voices ground her guilt in physical truth. Her contradictory impulses (to justify vs. witness, to carry vs. release) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final micro-choice—to leave the box open on the ridge—is earned by thirteen years of failed articulation and aligns with her renunciation of explanation for embodiment. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through porcelain glaze catching moonlight, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dr. Kael’s motivation—to correct despair as a mathematical error—is vividly embodied through her tactile rituals and quantum metaphors. Her internal contradiction (logical yet dreamy) manifests in every micro-choice, especially the mandala construction that merges intuition with calculation. The final renunciation—launching empty balloons—earns closure through three years of precise, costly labor. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in sea glass, shells, and trembling needles.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her profession and trauma, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“calloused fingers,” “heart a drum”). Her obsessive drive intensifies credibly into action, culminating in a meaningful shift from remembrance to restoration. However, the epiphany arrives with slight over-articulation (“Legacy's burden transformed from weight to compass”), bordering on diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied cost. The final choice feels earned but leans on conceptual clarity over visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The painter’s motivation is consistent and emotionally grounded, with the “borrowed heartbeat” serving as both anchor and cost. Her calm exterior contrasts subtly with the urgency of her task, though internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in real-time choices. The final renunciation—fading as the bells ring—is earned by prior causality, yet the emotional stakes feel more lyrical than visceral. A stronger micro-choice under pressure (e.g., sacrificing part of the heartbeat to sustain the vision) would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The negotiator’s interiority is richly rendered—his guilt over a failed cease-fire and belief in ritual as redemption feel embodied, not abstract. His “operatively gentle” trait manifests in action (inviting touch, whispering), not just label. However, his emotional shift at the climax (“weight of redemption shift[ed]… to the collective heart”) leans slightly toward diagnostic summary rather than fully dramatized sensation. The generals remain underdeveloped foils, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vesper’s amoral philanthropy and secret sentimentality are vividly embodied through micro-choices—diverting the river, releasing the egg—and his internal contradiction is sustained without diagnostic self-awareness. His whispered name and imagined villagers reveal layered guilt, though the emotional progression leans slightly toward poetic abstraction over visceral struggle in peak moments. The final museum observation shows credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: silence louder than compensation. A hairline slip occurs when his “sentimental wound” is labeled rather than dramatized in the closing museum scene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chaste courtesanship, poetic movement, and quiet defiance cohere into a singular identity. Her motivation to defy the lullaby emerges organically through micro-choices (dance as resistance) and culminates in a renunciation with visible cost: loss of reputation, future peril. The contradiction between societal performance and inner truth pulses throughout without diagnostic self-awareness. Final choice feels earned, though the speed of citywide transformation slightly softens the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Adrian’s motivation is rooted in a visceral rejection of beautifying lies, and his internal conflict—between artistry and truth—manifests through precise, embodied choices (e.g., using the story stick instead of brushes). The secondary characters’ shifts feel earned because their epiphanies arise from Adrian’s reversed narratives, not exposition. However, their interiority remains lightly sketched, limiting full emotional reciprocity. The final renunciations (trucker leaving, dealer contemplating) show credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Esme’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her transient rootedness clashes with her desire to memorialize loss, and her micro-choices (knotting hair through wing, building ephemeral signals) reveal a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. Her motivation stems from consistent traits (esoteric realism, reverence for overlooked histories), and her final act of witnessing embodies Earned Stasis: she forecloses permanence to honor impermanence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through precise sensory action (“blushing stillness,” “moss releasing spores”). The monarch’s appearance validates her endurance without resolving the ecological grief, preserving moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—shame over the cracked bell versus her yearning to preserve forgotten voices—is embodied with tactile precision and emotional authenticity. Her “technically gentle” hands become a metaphor for her moral recalibration, and her final choice to transcribe more names feels earned through accumulated micro-decisions (e.g., threading the rope, carving new wax). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action (“She wept as the names circled her”) and sensory immersion. The closure renunciation of perfectionism carries visible cost: she abandons bronze casting for fragile, evanescent sound—but gains purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—brittle nails, dreamlight work, moss tea—and her contradiction (farsighted through hindsight) drives every choice. Her final renunciation feels earned: she abandons the Archive not on impulse but after a recursive dream reveals the directive’s design. The laughing fox stamp and vines mirror her internal shift without over-explanation. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s frugality, empirical skepticism, and devotion to pattern form a coherent, contradictory core that drives every micro-choice—from surviving on three shekels to rejecting ritual in favor of chalk grids. His motivation crystallizes organically: not worship but preservation through understanding. The final renunciation—letting the tile vanish into starlight—is earned by his prior insistence on rationality over spectacle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in stylus scratches, thermal measurements, and windblown dust.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her pacifism isn’t passive but tactical, rooted in a deep understanding of memory as both weapon and wound. Her micro-choices (offering the pin, invoking cellular memory) reveal a hierarchy of values: empathy over force, impermanence over control. Elara’s resentment feels viscerally real, not abstract, because it’s encoded in “phantom DNA” and stacked like vertebrae—a flaw that compounds across timelines. The final renunciation (“let them be broken, whole, and broken again”) is earned through consistent causality and carries the cost of endless recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—capturing a fugitive dream—is rooted in his identity as mirror maker and embodied through tactile, sensory detail (“hands calloused from grinding glass,” “taste of impossible sweetness”). His internal contradiction (seeking vs. inviting the dream) resolves through action that erases boundaries between self and vision. The final choice—to breathe with the orchard—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: he becomes landscape, not just artisan. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is crystallized in craft.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mender’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt, longing, and resolve manifest through tactile actions (polishing quartz, tying the ribbon) rather than abstract reflection. Her contradiction—rigid craftswoman yet emotionally clumsy mother—drives every micro-choice. The daughter’s presence sharpens status dynamics without melodrama. Final renunciation of control (“let go, like leaves”) feels earned by prior struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    Evers’s bewilderment is not a flaw but the core of his function—a translator of cosmic grief—rendered through embodied contradiction: trembling hands, memory loss, yet precise ritual actions. His micro-choice to carve thought into the shell, not with tools but focus, reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over safety) with immediate cost (sanction, disorientation). The nonlinear inheritance manifests as authentic cognitive instability without therapy-speak, and his final endurance (“mournful curator”) is earned by prior struggle. Interiority remains tightly bound to sensory detail—liquid memories, humming fruit—and never drifts into diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her resourcefulness and linguistic expertise drive her actions—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction or emotional degradation under pressure. The botanist’s revival feels slightly convenient, with minimal struggle or cost to Elara beyond effort. Her final endurance (“listened for the next unheard symphony”) is credible but leans toward tidy resolution. The warden negotiation shows agency, yet emotional stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her fractured past, dual lineage, and yearning for solace feel specific and tactile. Her final choice to stay aboard is earned through the garden’s revelation, not imposed. However, her emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“unkindled solace,” “mosaic of two lives”) that borders on label-speak without sufficient counterbalancing action. The chimera twin premise informs her perception but doesn’t generate tangible contradiction in real-time decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation (“translate confusion into clarity”) is embodied in every action, especially her tactile engagement with the rope—a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. Her “warmly methodical” nature isn’t labeled but enacted through precise, patient manipulation of threads under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic interiority; instead, emotion lives in physical detail (“fingers still tingling with the texture of phantom threads”). Her flaw—overconfidence in adaptability—is subtle but shapes her willingness to enter the impossible door without hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a mapkeeper who cherishes silence. Her interiority is embodied through tactile interactions with the stone and ice, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward resolution without meaningful internal resistance or missteps that would deepen her struggle. The final endurance feels earned but leans slightly tidy for elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The custodian’s motivation—to prove coincidence has meaning—is embodied in precise micro-choices (e.g., tracing star paths, rotating the shard) and tied to her retrocognitive flaw. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through tactile engagement with glass and light. The final act of alignment earns her epiphany without sentimentality. One minor slip: the travelers’ arrival slightly externalizes her hope rather than deepening internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The archivist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “preemptively nostalgic grief” manifests in trembling hands and aching knees, not diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (kneeling on cold crystal, measuring shadows anew) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over comfort, listening over curation. The final renunciation—accepting memory as fog, not stone—is earned through tactile engagement with both forecourt chaos and monument precision. No head-hopping; single POV remains tightly focalized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cinder’s motivation is clear and consistent—defying hopelessness through ritualized fire—but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her resolve feels unwavering rather than hard-won. Emotions are embodied (“gravity of hopelessness thick as tar”) yet lean toward lyrical abstraction over visceral struggle. The final choice to ignite the rag knot is earned, but the cost (charred coil, expended fuel) feels symbolic rather than materially consequential. Her identity as a “wandering fireworks designer” remains ornamental, not catalytic to decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with water and jade cicada reveals contradictory impulses (grief vs. acceptance) without diagnostic labels. Her brother’s presence adds relational pressure, yet his characterization remains slightly archetypal (stubborn/sorrowful crab), limiting reciprocal depth. The micro-choice to speak softly—not promise but acknowledge shared transience—feels earned and costly. However, the brother’s shift lacks sufficient on-page friction to fully justify his acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s claustrophobia and yearning for sky form a credible, embodied contradiction that drives micro-choices (e.g., sealing the doll in glass, climbing during inversion). Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels; fear and exhilaration coexist physically (“heart a stretched muscle”). However, the father remains underdeveloped—his warnings lack reciprocal pressure, weakening relational stakes. Final renunciation (enduring the bunker as vessel) is earned through repeated ascents and sensory collection.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation—to teach silence how to comfort—is embodied through micro-choices (adjusting resonance panels, handing over the vial) and internal contradiction (her trust in organic intuition vs. reliance on instruments). The diplomat’s transformation feels earned because Kael’s actions are consistent with her quiet pedagogy, not exposition. Emotion is rendered through physical detail: his drumming fingers, tears refracting light, the vial’s crystalline shifts. Final renunciation—giving away her father’s heirloom—carries visible cost and deepens her commitment without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lore keeper’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile choices (resonance blade, chronoshawl) and a clear hierarchy of values—duty over personal ascension. Her “wisely adventurous” trait manifests in micro-decisions that foreclose paths (e.g., not claiming the throne). However, her emotional state remains slightly abstracted during peak stress (“time bled away”), lacking fully contradictory impulses in-scene. The renunciation is earned but borders on tidy; a hairline slip in visceral struggle keeps this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shadow keeper’s internal contradiction—burning bridges yet yearning to rebuild them—is embodied through tactile rituals (handling the ring, tending shadows) and crystallizes in her choice to teach breath. Her motivation evolves credibly from survival to reconciliation, with visible cost in the fading threshold. The scar-linking method grounds emotional connection in physicality, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the secondary character remains slightly archetypal, limiting full crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—transforming financial shame into communal restitution—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (turning the bolt, reprogramming the timer). His “virtuously mischievous” trait drives a credible, high-stakes choice with visible cost: risking expulsion for potential redemption. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; regret and resolve alternate rather than collide in-scene. The quantum promise backstory leans on diagnostic label-speak (“probabilistic bond”) without sufficient dramatization of its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dynasty ender’s motivation—rooted in ancestral erasure and a quest for truth—is consistent and deepened by embodied choices (e.g., turning the crank, closing the journal). His internal contradiction between ending and remembering is credibly resolved through action, not epiphany. However, his emotional state remains abstract at times (“heart a drum,” “silent gasp”) without sufficient visceral grounding under peak pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but leans slightly on lyrical assertion over concrete micro-choice cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aldric’s withdrawn nature and yearning for connection are embodied through tactile interaction with the marionettes and vines, not summarized. His final choice—stepping through the doorway—is earned by his isolation and desire to “capture the shape of possibility,” with clear cost: surrendering solitude for cosmic guardianship. Contradictory impulses (withdrawal vs. communion) act simultaneously in the climax. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marianne’s grief is embodied with precision—her micro-choices (cross-referencing military records, drafting the letter) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in her loss. Her motivation avoids sentimentality, and her final “tactfully hopeful” endurance reads as earned stasis with visible emotional cost. Interiority remains concrete (“dust told her the sequence”) without diagnostic label-speak. The absence of on-page secondary characters simplifies relational dynamics but doesn’t weaken single-POV depth.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her resourcefulness, grief for lost histories, and quiet fury feel specific and lived-in. Her contradictions (rebel janitor, careful yet defiant) drive key choices without tidy resolution. The final act—swallowing the crystal, scattering drives—shows values hierarchy with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The saxophonist’s motivation is consistent but underdeveloped; his interiority leans on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. He executes a task without visible struggle or meaningful choice—more vessel than agent. The “eerie nostalgia” recurs as mood, not as emotionally grounded conflict. His final endurance lacks a legible cost beyond atmospheric residue.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent—she decodes prophecy through seeds—but her internal conflict lacks contradiction or struggle. Emotions are lyrical but not embodied in tension; she moves with grace, never doubt. The final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through pressure or cost. No visible sacrifice or renunciation grounds her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her certainty with clocks versus uncertainty in life—is embodied in tactile choices (jamming the compass, leaving clocks imperfect) rather than stated. Her emotional arc is earned through micro-decisions under pressure, especially her climactic improvisation, which carries visible cost: she abandons mechanical perfection for lived imperfection. The grandfather’s backstory anchors her motivation without over-explaining, and her flaw (over-reliance on order) directly complicates her final act. No diagnostic label-speak; feelings emerge through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “luminous regret,” the weight of her signature, the tension between alchemical balance and mystical rupture—all rendered through concrete sensory detail rather than abstraction. Her micro-choices (heating the coin, speaking zodiac names) reveal a hierarchy of values: redemption over rescue, recognition over recovery. The flaw lies in slight over-articulation of her epiphany (“redemption was not a finding but a recognizing”), which edges toward diagnostic phrasing, though it’s quickly grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear moved through "as one moves through rain," grief clinging like mist—and their flaw (abandoning the child’s laughter) directly motivates the central pursuit. The final laugh, “misaligned and honest,” earns the emotional shift through concrete sensory detail rather than abstraction. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. self-preservation) operate simultaneously in every harp strike. The cost of integration—the “luminous ache”—is felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation—to discover the mathematics of mercy—is compelling and rooted in trauma, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward epiphany without meaningful resistance or self-sabotage. Her proprioceptive enhancement is embodied well, yet emotional states verge on diagnostic (“trauma responses had become a strange compass”) rather than viscerally chaotic. The final renunciation of calculation for lived experience is earned, though the transition leans slightly tidy. Micro-choices (bracing, gripping the strap) reveal values, but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is consistent and emotionally grounded, rooted in childhood memory and embodied through tactile interaction with the fragment. Their interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing contradiction through sensory detail (e.g., glass shifting from “cool stone to warm”). The final choice—to become a keeper—feels earned by prior causality, though the alchemist remains underdeveloped as a secondary character. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; emotional progression is layered but slightly smoothed by lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marlon’s motivation—“to discover what ceilings hide”—is embodied through precise micro-choices (climbing the counter, pocketing one mainspring) that reveal a hierarchy of values: witness over repairman, testimony over extraction. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, grief and obsession manifest via tactile perception (“dust itself became a language”). The final renunciation—leaving most springs for authorities—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: he now carries the “weightless burden” permanently. Contradictory impulses (professional detachment vs. spectral empathy) act simultaneously without resolution, deepening his credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to compress eternity into a moment—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits: her devotion to ink, type, and frost-patterns amid fluid reality. Her internal conflict (preservation vs. surrender) manifests simultaneously in trembling hands and deliberate action. The final choice—uncorking the whisper and transcribing the spiral—feels earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the library’s dissolution and her relinquishment of control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through tactile detail (“wrapped around her fingertips like smoke made of memory”).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through poetic perception and embodied contradiction—his defunct revolutionary fire tempered into quiet resolve. His micro-choices (covering the mirror, pressing the shard) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on truth over comfort. Voss functions effectively as secondary pressure, though his shift feels slightly abrupt. The shard anchors motivation without diagnostic self-awareness, avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The repairman’s motivation—rooted in a past lie that cursed him with rust—is embodied through tactile pain and precise micro-choices (e.g., whispering true names to gears). His internal conflict between doubt and honesty manifests physically, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. The woman in the veil exerts immediate pressure without diluting focus. Final renunciation of forging something “entirely yours” earns his healing through consistent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her “sensibly eccentric” conviction manifests in tactile choices (decanting petrichor, placing the compass) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her renunciation at the lagoon’s edge is earned by seventeen years of sensory archiving and the psychometric vision, foreclosing personal transcendence in favor of stewardship. The final decision carries visible cost: empty vials, abandoned answers, and lifelong solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through mineral breath, resonant hush, and the weight of glass vials.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation—“to scaffold complexity with simplicity”—is embodied in her tactile relationship with driftwood and culminates in a carved token that fuses ancestral legacy with personal insight. Her “perpetually learning” nature manifests as active listening to wood, wind, and stone rather than passive introspection. The final choice to place her carving in the archway is earned through layered discovery, not epiphany, and carries conceptual cost: she accepts her role in a lineage beyond individual authorship. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete and sensory throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sable’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied actions—mixing pigments, pressing her palm to glass—and her quiet drive feels consistent and particular. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through sensory experience. However, the final realization (“darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation”) edges toward abstraction without sufficient micro-choice anchoring in that exact moment. The cost of her reckoning is felt but slightly generalized rather than tied to a concrete renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and morally complex—her drive to uncover truth wars with fear of reigniting violence, embodied in sand-filled sheets and searing reveries. Her final choice to include the Under-Minister’s grandfather reflects nuanced understanding, not tidy resolution. The retro-cognitive bleed makes her trauma visceral without diagnostic over-explanation. Her micro-choices (arranging debris mid-parley) reveal hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied gestures—pacing, turning over memories like shells—and his rejection of false comfort drives consistent, high-stakes choices. His motivation to reimagine rather than resurrect is rooted in a coherent flaw: an aversion to nostalgic delusion that forecloses easy emotional resolution. The final renunciation (not opening the bottle) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, his emotional contradiction remains slightly abstracted; we see his stance more than feel its visceral tension in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, phantom itch, and instinctive utterance of dead syllables reveal a lifetime of ritualized emotional archiving. His motivation (to preserve emotional patterns) directly drives the accidental prophecy and his subsequent immersion of the wax, creating credible cause-and-effect. The final choice—to seal the prophecy in the vault—is earned by his professional ethos and personal dread, with tangible cost: he now carries a burden that reconfigures his life’s work from archive to oracle. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile memory and ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile handling of the acorn cap, her sensory immersion in frost and starlight—but her motivation leans on inherited duty without sufficient internal contradiction. The choice to reopen the vortex feels inevitable rather than wrestled, softening the cost. Her emotional arc aligns with theme but lacks a tangible trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Still, her micro-choices (scattering seeds, scooping starlight) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in ancestral continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied: her “credibly curious” nature manifests in micro-choices (testing the rope, checking instruments) that reveal a hierarchy of values—precision over panic, listening over noise. Her contradiction—duty versus doubt—is active in-scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (“Warning: silence”) carries visible cost: risking credibility to honor data and wisdom. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception and professional ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sola’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception (“hands worn from sweeping cosmic dust,” “heart... began to soften”) and consistent spiritual curiosity, but her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than contradiction-in-action. Her vulnerability-to-strength arc is emotionally coherent yet lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an alternative path—her choice to preserve the glass feels inevitable, not costly. The absence of secondary characters limits relational crucible, but single-POV execution remains strong. Final renunciation (embracing stillness) is earned, though the cost remains conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to preserve unspoken words—is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving her vow to restore the hives. Her interiority is concrete (“dust motes danced in the brittle light”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure; she receives revelation rather than wrestles with contradiction. The ghost functions more as symbol than crucible, limiting relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her borrowed time manifests as tactile urgency, not diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (embedding cryptic listings, recognizing the reply’s paradox) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over safety, connection over solitude. The urn fragment catalyzes her shift from cataloguer to co-keeper, earned through consistent pressure. Flawed yet competent, she reads as an individual shaped by temporal scarcity, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation—to find beauty in the incomplete—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices like gathering debris and leaving the feather as an offering. However, interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete contradiction or struggle; his emotional state remains serene throughout, lacking genuine tension or flawed missteps. The absence of a second character simplifies relational dynamics but also removes opportunity for pressure that might reveal deeper flaws. His final renunciation (accepting incompleteness) feels earned thematically but lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation—transforming legacy through translation rather than preservation—is rooted in consistent, embodied choices: his refusal to cut vines, his systematic wrapping despite physical decline. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile detail (copper singing, stone pulsing). His final act earns Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the body dissolves into architecture. Contradictory impulses—urgency vs. patience—are held in tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The luminous skeptic’s motivation—rooted in academic rebellion and skepticism toward official narratives—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., pocketing the amber, analyzing footprints). Her internal contradiction (skeptic yet seeker) manifests physically and intellectually without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of pure rebellion in favor of evidence-based seeking feels earned. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans on poetic abstraction (“heart a quiet forge”) rather than visceral sensation, slightly muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coachman’s motivation—reclaiming the battlefield through memory, song, and seed—is consistent, embodied, and intensified by his silent trauma. His micro-choices (chanting dead languages, following gull calls, planting pods) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in grief and hope. Interiority is concrete: “his eyes held the dust of a thousand battles” avoids diagnostic labels while conveying depth. The final endurance—tending the garden without erasing loss—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Wick’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his exhaustion wars with residual instinct, his grief with hope. His micro-choices (carrying the leaf, interpreting static) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in love, not duty. The revelation that M.E. is Maya Esrin feels earned, not convenient, because it emerges through sensory and emotional logic. His final renunciation of body-finding for connection carries visible cost: he accepts memory over presence, yet finds closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in familial ritual and existential solitude—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (sketching, consulting the compass). Interiority avoids diagnostic phrasing, instead rendering emotion via sensory detail (“each heartbeat echoing twice as long”). The final choice to leave is earned by prior micro-choices (tracing stars, interpreting the flicker), though the “blessed pariah” label leans slightly toward abstraction without deeper exploration of its social or psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied wonder and fear, with micro-choices (e.g., selecting specific chess pieces) revealing his hierarchy of values. His “sacredly playful” ethos feels lived rather than labeled, though the absence of on-page conflict with another character limits relational crucible testing. The master’s off-page presence functions effectively as motivation without over-explaining. Final renunciation—leaving chess pieces behind—is earned by prior reverence for wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his scarred hands, historian identity, and micro-choices (e.g., carving pawns from palace wreckage) reveal layered motivation without diagnostic label-speak. His contradiction—crisis actor turned real survivor—fuels credible endurance, not epiphany. The prisoner’s emergence tests his stance, but Kael’s renunciation of nomadic life for sanctuary feels earned through prior gesture-collecting. Minor deduction: prisoner’s interiority remains underexplored despite on-page presence.

    Mira’s motivation—to understand “the shape of home”—is visceral and consistent, rooted in pain and longing. Her internal conflict (desire vs. fear of reopening wounds) manifests in embodied choices: trembling fingers, the deliberate press of the feather. The final act feels earned, with clear cost: shattering the balance of the substituted nights. However, her interiority occasionally leans on poetic abstraction (“mercury-glass eyes,” “shard that cut each recollection”) without grounding those metaphors in specific, character-particular sensation, slightly diluting emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tutor’s guilt-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (fidgeting, plucking threads), and his internal conflict—between past failure and present responsibility—is credibly layered. His final choice to teach the girl reconfigures his identity without erasing his flaw, achieving Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. The young girl functions as a crucible, not a prop, forcing him to confront his history. However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy in the closing beats, softening the rawness expected under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s “innocently mischievous” defiance is embodied through consistent micro-choices—painting verses, hurling pigment—that reveal his hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction (artist vs. exile) drives credible action without diagnostic self-awareness. Mara’s emergence as apprentice feels earned through shared questioning, not convenience. The cost of his rebellion—fractured Elder authority, communal reorientation—is visible and scaled to the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, heartbeat-counting, and breath-holding fuse physical sensation with emotional stakes. Her motivation (to “conjure meaning from absence”) drives micro-choices that escalate under pressure, culminating in a credible endurance that accepts transformation as cost. The line “uncertainty was not weakness but the precise weight needed to balance destruction” crystallizes her arc without diagnostic label-speak. Her flaws (trembling, uncertainty) are active constraints, not decorative traits.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and rooted in nostalgia, with interiority rendered through sensory memory rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—carrying the seashell, entering the cave, painting in the oasis—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. However, his internal conflict remains largely atmospheric rather than actively contradictory in-scene; we see longing but not simultaneous opposing impulses that force difficult trade-offs under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a visible cost beyond emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her silent observation, tactile memory of the cork, and withheld tenderness reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Marcus’s shift from shouting to trembling silence feels earned through Elara’s sustained micro-choices, not epiphany. Their relationship functions as crucible: his fear of silence and her belief in whispers collide and resolve in a single, charged gesture. The final cost—his voice “cracked and raw from disuse”—is felt, specific, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation—navigating loss to recover his sister—is vividly embodied through tactile memory, micro-choices (soldering, tracing coordinates), and emotional contradiction (determination vs. grief). His flaw isn’t safety-hedged; he’s competent yet haunted, and his final endurance forecloses further searching with visible cost: the silent phone, the waning censer. However, interiority occasionally leans into lyrical abstraction (“geography of loss”) without grounding in immediate sensation, slightly softening the rawness expected at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—cultivating psychological safety—is compellingly rooted in duty and fear, and their internal conflict between rational control and involuntary truth-telling is embodied through precise actions (burying, binding, revealing the eye). The shift from suppression to calibrated use of truth feels earned, with visible cost in vulnerability and risk. However, secondary characters remain impressionistic; their shared healing lacks individualized pressure or contradiction, weakening relational stakes. The final renunciation isn’t of truth itself but of unilateral control—a nuanced, character-driven endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cornelius’s interiority is richly embodied—his tactile interaction with the edelweiss, his pacing, his whispered name—all reveal a man shaped by solitude and duty. His motivation (to witness the lost) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: kneeling, focusing on gaps, placing the flower in a jar. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of anonymity—he accepts the burden of memory, foreclosing further isolation with visible emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (desire for connection vs. chosen solitude) pulse beneath every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Merrick’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling fingers, the chip as a “second heartbeat,” his claustrophobia in the passage—and his empirically intuitive trait drives micro-choices (following ants, reading engravings) that feel earned. His contradiction between solitude and longing for Clara’s fire culminates in a decisive renunciation with palpable cost: vanishing into the doorway alone. The final line reveals the ultimate price: erasure of self, leaving only the extinguished chip. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    The queen’s disenchantment is embodied through tactile detail—soaked slippers, thorns that “grew upward”—and her final renunciation feels earned by consistent internal contradiction: longing for meaning versus the hollow trappings of power. Her transformation from sovereign to sentinel crystallizes without sentimentality, and the cost—loss of name, throne, memory—is rendered with quiet devastation in lines like “her memories were already fading, replaced by the weight of a thousand years of watching.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to capture the “density of presence”—is vividly embodied through tactile actions (handling the shell, mixing pigments) and internal contradiction (yearning for cosmic permanence amid impermanence). Kael’s scientifically romantic worldview complements hers without flattening into archetype. However, their emotional arcs lack friction; choices feel harmonious rather than pressured, muting the cost of revaluation. The final solidarity gesture reads as affirmation, not earned endurance with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicler’s interiority is vividly embodied—jealousy, disorientation, and resolve manifest through tactile choices (gripping bark, stepping through unopened doors). His motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” fuels credible micro-decisions under pressure, culminating in an Earned Stasis that accepts multiplicity over linear identity. The final renunciation of jealousy for “weary wonder” feels earned by the accumulation of contradictory selves. No diagnostic label-speak mars the crisis; emotion arises through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her loss of smell manifests in distrust of other senses, not abstract grief. Her micro-choices (closing eyes to receive differently, accepting the screw as talisman) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Marcus’s dialogue avoids diagnostic label-speak; his wisdom emerges through craft, not exposition. The final renunciation of control over grief is earned by prior causality and carries palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelin’s motivation to transform scars into stories is consistent and embodied through her trembling hands, crystallizing ink, and ritualized actions. Her internal conflict—between grief and the desire for meaning—is rendered with sensory specificity rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves linearly from anxiety to resolution without visible resistance or self-sabotage mid-ceremony. The final renunciation of fear feels earned but slightly tidy given the absence of a counter-impulse during the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation—delivering an overdue apology—is rooted in a specific past failure, and her internal conflict (protective intent vs. destructive outcome) manifests physically through hesitant gestures and metaphor-laden speech. Linden’s skepticism-turned-softening feels earned because his silence and minor-key response emerge from embodied history, not exposition. Their micro-choices (granting permission, offering a hand) carry visible relational cost. However, Linden’s interiority remains slightly opaque; we infer rather than witness his shift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The witness’s motivation evolves credibly from desire to recognition, embodied through tactile interaction with the dictionary and spatial navigation of the library. Her internal contradiction—between observation and action—is resolved via a meaningful renunciation (surrendering truth as possession), foreclosing passivity with felt cost. The final transformation (paper to bone, ink to blood) is earned by prior micro-choices, though her emotional arc leans slightly abstract in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through tactile, idiosyncratic perception (“spoke to the gears as if they were old friends”), and his motivation—to understand what clocks truly measure—is consistent and deepens organically. However, his epiphany arrives with minimal friction or contradictory impulse; the realization feels elegant but unearned by struggle. The “eminently peculiar” trait remains largely ornamental, not shaping choices under pressure. His final understanding lacks a visible cost beyond abstract reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—spatial perception, grief, and professional rigor interweave without diagnostic label-speak. Their micro-choice to deactivate alarms stems credibly from weeks of observation and culminates in a renunciation of rigid security doctrine. The old woman’s presence reframes Kael’s understanding not through exposition but tactile revelation (the photograph, the mushroom stem). Flaws like over-certainty are avoided; instead, their “spatially gifted” mind becomes a conduit for emotional insight, not omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lila’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her academic rigor battling inherited superstition—and her micro-choices (decoding scrawls, entering the alcove) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (“teach the beauty of probability without the pain of loss”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness in the climax (“language of existence… chance and certainty coexisted”), bordering on label-speak that softens the rawness expected under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation evolves credibly from practiced detachment to active compassion, anchored in embodied details like her cut palms and the stool she climbs. Her internal contradiction—craving connection yet cultivating estrangement—is dramatized through micro-choices (answering calls, weaving stories, shattering the disc). The thawing of her “frozen” heart avoids therapy-speak by tying emotion to action (“offering quiet words until he breathed easier”). However, the transition from passive listener to mythic “operator who taught endings how to begin” leans slightly toward unearned epiphany without deeper struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her reverence for fragile histories, her haunted euphoria, and her resolve feel specific and earned. However, her motivation hinges on a remembered covenant never dramatized, making the emotional pivot rely on summary rather than contradiction in scene. The final choice to leave jasmine feels resonant but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Her “gently thorough” trait is shown but not tested under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s “desperately jocular” tone and logistical role feel vividly embodied, especially in her laughter at crumbling walls “as if they were old friends.” Her micro-choices—offering the moon rock only for stories—reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in reciprocity. However, secondary characters like Gus or Elara remain archetypal; their interiority is inferred rather than dramatized. The final renunciation (leaving the fragment) is earned, though its emotional cost is implied more than viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—navigating grief through tactile cartography—is embodied, consistent, and intensifies credibly. Her internal conflict (between inherited duty and personal sorrow) manifests through micro-choices like kneeling at the stillpoint or trusting the ring’s pull. Emotions are rendered through sensory specificity (“quiet blaze behind her ribs,” “shivers” translating ultrasonic frequencies), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of external maps for inner guidance is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost: she accepts unspoken grief as terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s “confidently uncertain stance” manifests as a lived contradiction, not a label—his edits are precise yet restrained, his emotional embodiment subtle (e.g., “lines of worry smoothing” in the viewport). His micro-choices (which errors to correct, which timelines to sacrifice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: altered relationships, lost laughter, irreversible omissions. The hydroponic moss substitution exemplifies how flaws seed growth rather than neat redemption. No diagnostic self-awareness; interiority remains concrete and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his rusted voice, clumsy hands, and filmless camera convey decades of eroded selfhood without diagnostic labels. His motivation (to be remembered) pivots credibly into self-reclamation through the advisor’s intervention. The final choice—to sign his own existence—is earned by micro-choices: lifting the camera again, attempting gestures, accepting silence as language. Cost is felt in his irreversible departure from passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is richly embodied—ash on fingertips, dissolving tapestry threads—and their contradictory impulses (destruction as mercy vs. creation as atonement) drive every choice. The final act of sketching with charcoal from their “burned past” crystallizes a renunciation earned by prior causality. Their flaw—complicity in the Revisionist system—is not hedged but confronted with volcanic tenderness. The mentor’s dying words resurface organically through tactile memory, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kael’s motivation—breathing life into a shared dream with Mira—is rooted in specific, embodied memories (strawberries, laughter) and drives every micro-choice, from disabling his cuff to drumming on his ribcage. His internal contradiction—desiring union yet bearing fragmented grief—is active throughout, not summarized. The final renunciation (dissolving into sound) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: loss of body, data, individuality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile, rhythmic action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “calculated spontaneity” embodies the tension between order and chaos. His flaw (overreliance on acoustic precision) is tested under storm pressure, and his final choice forecloses the smuggler’s threat with visible cost: breathless arrival, reliance on imperfect human perception. The smuggler’s smooth walk and watchman’s reaction are filtered through Marek’s embodied expertise, never abstracted. His renunciation of brute force in favor of whispering aligns perfectly with his established worldview and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The guardian’s motivation—teaching darkness the value of stars—is consistent and embodied through action, not exposition. The child’s unspoken fears are sensed and addressed via silent empathy, showing interiority without diagnostic labels. However, both characters remain archetypal; their choices lack contradictory impulses or visible cost beyond mood. The final smile feels earned but emotionally tidy, missing the grit of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mr. Hartwin’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his desire to “plant forests of second thoughts” drives tangible choices like the window displays and grotto tournament. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory and symbolic perception (“hearing unspoken worries,” cradling the pawn). The final whisper to the child crystallizes his arc without over-explaining. Minor deduction: secondary characters remain impressionistic, but spatial choreography holds under Track C allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—duty versus dance—is embodied in physicality (“calloused feet,” “dancer’s grace”) and resolved through micro-choices (offering her palm, swaying ashore). Her transformation feels earned, though the guardian’s dissolution slightly shortcuts the emotional cost of unlocking a “guarded heart.” The final renunciation of cargo work for dance carries visible opportunity cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The performer’s interior contradiction—grief masked by mandated blankness, rebellion through narration paired with complicity as informant—is sustained with embodied specificity (e.g., “grief pooled like dark water,” the brittle petal’s crunch). Moral ambiguity is not balanced artificially but lived through micro-choices: whittling a bone for the dog while planning to report it. The final renunciation (continuing to whittle despite emotional void) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. However, the epiphany about “carving hope from despair” leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak, softening the rawness expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cloud-shadow poet’s motivation—rooted in aesthetic drive and boundary-dissolving—is consistent and embodied through tactile interactions (e.g., fingertips grazing quartz). Internal conflict emerges via simultaneous impulses: reverence for silence versus urge to paraphrase the hum. However, emotional progression leans slightly abstract; the “tremor of certainty” lacks contradictory resistance, softening the cost of her transcendence. Final endurance feels earned but borders on unearned epiphany due to minimal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s colorblindness and “innocently cunning” nature are embodied through specific choices—bartering with Dorian, using the reed tongue, arranging plants—that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction (seeking beauty without color) drives authentic micro-decisions under pressure. Dorian’s stoicism and transformation feel earned, though his interiority remains slightly less textured than Elara’s. The mutual awakening is credible because both characters act from consistent, flawed motives.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—discovering “the texture of connection”—is embodied through tactile choices: adjusting the lens, ringing the bell off-center, privileging imperfection. Her internal contradiction (healing vs. confronting loss) manifests in real-time action, not summary. Mara’s presence sharpens status dynamics without flattening either character. The final renunciation of digital purity is earned by seventeen years of failed simulations and crystallized in a single micro-choice: tilting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction: her numb craftsmanship versus the “subdued ardor” that reawakens. Her micro-choices—folding vellum, leaving cranes—are precise acts of renunciation and renewal, each carrying the weight of her white-dwarf grief. The final revelation that she taught herself via Mnemosyne is earned by prior causality and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. Interiority remains concrete (“fingers numb with genuinely artificial weight”) without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s “steadily curious” trait manifests as embodied micro-choices—measuring floorboards, rotating card spreads—that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The architect’s trembling hands and loose suit convey visceral collapse without exposition. Their interaction avoids therapy-speak; emotions emerge through tactile detail (onyx ink pooling, rain on skylight). Final renunciation of “single chains of truth” feels earned by prior pattern-mapping behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with embodied emotion ("anguished joy," "heartbeat echoing") and consistent micro-choices (her "steadily unpredictable" movement). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—grief and purpose alternate rather than collide. The final renunciation feels earned but borders on epiphanic without sufficient struggle during the purification sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—preserving hope through quiet attention—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“luminous regret,” “pocket now empty”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The river stone anchors her emotional arc, and her final renunciation (sacrificing the stone, part of herself) is earned with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. loss) coexist without resolution, deepening her humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, shame, and recalibrated resolve feel specific and earned. Contradictory impulses (self-reproach vs. compassion) operate simultaneously, especially in her care for Veridian despite her disillusionment. Her final choice—to report the fraud while requesting continued animal custody—carries visible cost and forecloses a path of evasion. The chameleon’s tail becomes both mirror and measure of her moral recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation as a “closure seeker” is vividly embodied in her tactile engagement with scars, coffee rings, and the tunnel—yet her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves from confusion to certainty without resisting the fern’s guidance or questioning the miracle’s cost. Her epiphany feels earned through sensory immersion but leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“verses in a poem of survival”) that borders on label-speak. Micro-choices (pulling aside the tapestry, kneeling at the pool) align cleanly with her drive, and the displaced miracle’s integration into her bones conveys credible transformation. However, the absence of genuine struggle against her own telepathic ability or doubt about the tunnel’s safety softens the flaw-complication dynamic expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—rooted in her spatially imaginative psyche and role as crystal gazer—drives every action with emotional and conceptual coherence. Her internal conflict between duty and personal grief (for Elena) manifests through embodied choices, not exposition. The final renunciation—carrying the theater’s love into the world—is earned by prior causality and charged with visible cost: solitude, silence, and burden. No diagnostic label-speak; feelings emerge through tactile perception and precise micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly rendered through poetic perception, but her motivation remains abstractly framed rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her “trapped creativity” functions more as a lyrical condition than a dramatized struggle with tangible stakes or contradictions. The final shift feels earned thematically but lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off with visible cost. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the single-POV execution falters in showing struggle over stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dreamless freight guard’s motivation—shepherding memory against forgetting—is embodied through micro-choices (planting the archive, singing until bleeding) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering emotion through tactile, quantum-inflected perception (“static charge of a world stopped mid-turn”). The final renunciation—becoming part of the charm—is earned by prior causality and carries the ultimate cost: dissolution of self into function. Contradictory impulses (guard vs. freight, memory vs. forgetting) act simultaneously, crystallizing in the Charged Poise of “occasionally everywhere and now finally nowhere.”

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    The philosopher’s motivation—rediscovering the wild frontier of her mind—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., collecting questions instead of explanations) and evolves credibly from logician to architect of consciousness. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; insight emerges as vibration, not exposition. The gear functions as both object and extension of self, revealing contradictory impulses: yearning for order vs. surrender to wildness. Final renunciation of explanation in favor of wonder feels earned, with cost legible in lost certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lin’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied (“heartbeat echoing the hollow surf,” “quiet courage stir beneath the fear”), with micro-choices (accepting the ticket, boarding the ferry) revealing a hierarchy of values. The dog functions as emotional anchor rather than mere prop. However, Lin’s shift from passive grief to purposeful action lacks a distinct contradictory impulse in-scene—fear and courage alternate rather than coexist under pressure, slightly flattening emotional complexity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in guilt, embodied through nerve pain and the bolt—is consistent, contradictory (desire for redemption vs. fear of reintegration), and culminates in a micro-choice that forecloses her exile. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead rendering trauma through tactile sensation (“pressed it against her palm until the nerve endings screamed”). The final decision to report the rust stain is earned by prior causality: her penance, her observation skills, and her moral recalibration. Milo’s loss and the precentor’s silent nod crystallize cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sylvar’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as guardian across eons, and his quiet agency drives the plot. His interiority is conveyed through embodied presence (“quiet thunder,” “regally unpretentious grace”) rather than exposition. Vael’s hollow ambition contrasts effectively, though his internal conflict remains underexplored. The final renunciation of illusion carries visible cost, satisfying Earned Stasis with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lina’s interiority is concrete and particular—her tapping rhythm, embodied grief over bleached reefs, and tactile engagement with the atlas page reveal a coherent emotional logic. Her motivation (to understand vanished paths) intensifies credibly through data assembly and culminates in a conceptual revelation that reconfigures her role from passive witness to active memorialist. The final choice—to keep tapping as witness—feels earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost: acceptance of irreversible loss. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars her enduring contradiction between helplessness and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kai’s interiority is vividly embodied—her bare feet reading “the floor’s memory,” her teeth aching from resonance—and her motivation (to find meaning in silence) compels escalating action. Her awkward confidence crystallizes into certainty organically, and her final renunciation of passive waiting carries quiet cost. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; emotion emerges through tactile perception and micro-choices (kneeling, singing). Her flaw—trusting frequencies over tactics—is consistent and shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her gnarled fingers, plant-sympathy, and grief over her daughter’s death fuse motive, memory, and micro-choice without diagnostic label-speak. Her contradiction—reverent grandmother vs. quiet insurgent—is active in scene, not summarized. The final transfer of the seed to her grandson crystallizes a renunciation of passive waiting with tangible cost: risking ostracism as “traitor.” Her emotional arc is earned through decades of coded resistance, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his trauma lives in nerve endings, not therapy-speak. His quiet talent manifests through micro-choices (sketching orchids, pressing palm to bark) that reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving sensation over escaping pain. The final renunciation—accepting both shadow and smile—is earned by somatic causality, not abstraction. No diagnostic labels; grief is rendered through pressure, texture, and stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction: her trembling hands versus her decisive untangling, her grief versus her creative hunger. Her internal conflict—between capturing souls and fearing her own emptiness—is dramatized in tactile choices (touching threads, weaving) rather than abstract reflection. The final renunciation of luminous surfaces for necessary darkness is earned by prior beats showing her artistic crisis. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through salt-weeping mortar, phantom hums under nails, and paint-stained stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “serene anger,” “conscious wildness,” and sensory hypersensitivity shape every action. His motivation (understanding time dilation in crisis) is consistent, personal, and escalated by the drone’s disappearance. The flashback to his mentor’s loss deepens without flattening pressure, anchored by present stimuli (the drone’s echo). His final choice—to spill ink again—is earned, foreclosing immediate resolution with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interior conflict is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, breath in the cold, and moral calculus feel specific and urgent. Her motivation crystallizes organically from discovery to action without diagnostic label-speak. The final choice carries visible cost: she becomes “the most dangerous woman,” yet endures with quiet resolve (Earned Stasis). Her professional identity as archivist directly fuels both her hesitation and rebellion, making her arc inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is vividly embodied—her perception, pacifism, and inherited vigilance shape micro-choices (e.g., sheathing the knife, offering tea without interrogation). The stranger’s presence tests her values, but her renunciation of violence feels earned, not performative. However, the father’s influence leans slightly toward symbolic shorthand rather than fully dramatized contradiction. Her endurance carries cost (isolation, vulnerability), yet the emotional stakes lack a sharper edge of personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    Avery’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief as a “sharp ping,” her calm as a “low thrum”—and her micro-choices (zigzag path, voicing silence) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her renunciation at the climax (“some things are caught only to be released”) feels earned by seventeen years of disciplined longing. The contradiction between feral desire and cool-headed restraint operates simultaneously, not as alternating moods but as fused tension. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action and tool-mediated perception.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Victoria’s interiority is richly embodied—her observational nature, inherited guilt, and moral tension manifest through tactile detail (the rosewood nib) and micro-choices (signing with ancestral ink). Her contradictory impulses—loyalty vs. truth, legacy vs. justice—act simultaneously in scene. The final act of writing the counter-memo feels earned by decades of regret and a lifetime of trained perception. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her guilt, grief, and resolve manifest through tactile choices (tattoo needle as stylus, ink that burns cold). Contradictory impulses (to tether vs. untether) act simultaneously during meteor hush. Her final renunciation forecloses her role as keeper with visible cost: silence where constellations once pulsed. The realization that the letters are from her future self deepens motivation without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chalk artist’s motivation—to discover meaning in collective forgetting—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her to risk the grotto’s ravenous silence. Her socially perceptive trait informs micro-choices (e.g., interpreting the tile’s whisper, calculating the seventh-turn break) with visible cost: she sobers from whimsy into responsibility. Interiority is concrete (“fingers… read the silence like braille”) and avoids diagnostic labels. However, her emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she moves cleanly from curiosity to resolve without simultaneous resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arin’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—“heart forged in frost and flame,” “warm coldness”—but his motivation leans on abstract phrasing (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) without sufficient micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The retrocognitive trait is stated but not dramatized as a constraint affecting decisions. His final act feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior struggle, limiting the cost’s tangibility.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost’s motivation—craving one more ovation—is consistent and emotionally grounded, and his choice to gift his encore to the actress feels earned. The young actress’s despair and renewal are embodied through breath, voice, and posture rather than abstract labels. However, her internal contradiction (desire vs. despair) is implied but not dramatized in simultaneous impulses; she shifts too cleanly from hopelessness to resolve. The ghost’s agency drives the arc, but the human character’s transformation leans slightly on received emotion rather than micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lina’s affectionate skepticism is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (geode, somatic marker) and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values—curiosity over fear, empirical caution over blind belief. Her internal contradiction (skeptic yet hopeful) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final renunciation of pure doubt feels earned, though the emotional cost remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. No diagnostic label-speak mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lira’s motivation—to become the voice of the unknown—is consistent and embodied through her sensory mapping and song, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily toward epiphany without resistance or doubt. The grief she absorbs feels externalized rather than wrestled with, reducing emotional complexity. Her final choice to sing is compelling yet untested by counter-desire. Still, her micro-choices (extending the sensor, pressing her palm to the wall) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to memory and translation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    The hourglass turner’s motivation evolves credibly from archival duty to urgent stewardship, grounded in decades of tactile labor (cataloging buttons) that embodies her internal shift. Her final choice—to cork the jar yet let the echo resonate—enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: she abandons control over the prophecy, trusting collective reception over solitary custody. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest through precise physical interactions (brushing hourglasses, tapping buttons). The child’s burial button crystallizes her moral calculus, linking personal sacrifice to communal possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “prudently daring” ethos manifests in micro-choices (digging slowly, deliberate gestures) that reveal a hierarchy of values: loyalty over protocol, restoration over escape. His emotional arc—from burdened exile to quiet hope—is embodied in tactile details (worn pillbox, frozen capsule) rather than diagnostic labels. The courier functions as effective secondary pressure without diluting focus. Final renunciation of the pillbox carries visible cost and credibly reconfigures his self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation—to distill complexity into essence—is embodied through tactile habits (yarn needle, listening to gutters) and crystallized in his final renunciation of all but the promise. His internal contradiction (enduring vs. hoping) plays out in real-time micro-choices: standing when hooves vibrate, aligning needles without words. The woman’s parallel arc (widowed, returning with matching needle) makes their reunion a crucible that reconfigures thirty-seven years of overwriting. Flaws like passivity are offset by the cost of his rootedness—becoming “part of the landscape”—which charges the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kai’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with clay, glass, and hive reveals a coherent worldview shaped by craft and quiet observation. Her motivation (“to understand why some places resist change”) drives every action without over-explanation. The final renunciation (leaving the bowl behind) feels earned through accumulated micro-choices, though the absence of interpersonal pressure slightly limits emotional contradiction. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation is deeply rooted in generational legacy and grief, rendered through precise micro-choices—using the bitting gauge to score earth, planting moonflowers instead of roses—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion is embodied in tactile memory (machine oil, pipe tobacco) and rhythmic movement. The final renunciation—letting go of the fire escape garden—is earned by twenty years of devotion and crystallizes as “horizontal hope.” Flawlessly integrates backstory with present action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her isolation “presses like cold glass,” her awakening is “brittle”—and her motivation to transform observer into bridge feels urgent and consistent. However, the shift from passive witness to active “weaver of time” lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure; the transformation leans on epiphany rather than struggle. The cost of independence (carrying extinct legacies) is conceptually present but not viscerally felt in action. Contradictory impulses are implied but not dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “whimsical ache” and tactile engagement with the nest feel particular, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (cupping the nest, initiating collaboration, sealing her letter) reveal a hierarchy of values shifting from secrecy to shared vulnerability. However, secondary characters (potter, poet) lack individuated pressure; they function as archetypes supporting Lira’s arc rather than exerting independent force. The final act—writing to herself—is earned by prior restlessness but borders on tidy without deeper friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her “cautiously hopeful” nature evolves from vulnerability to weaponized resolve without sentimentality. Her micro-choices (e.g., recalibrating equipment despite risk) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: isolation, professional sabotage, and the burden of solitary knowledge. Flaws like naivety compound early but are credibly overcome through struggle, not epiphany. The final endurance (“stubborn faith”) reads as earned stasis under cosmic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature create credible internal conflict, embodied in trembling hands steadied by resolve. Her micro-choices—trusting the organ’s guidance while keeping a hand on the compass—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Motivation is consistent and intensifies believably, though her emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior friction. The final act feels earned but borders on diagnostic clarity (“wistful rebellion”) that risks label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the engine of her method and emotional arc. Her internal contradiction—precision as armor vs. empathy as wound—is embodied in tactile choices (touching the ribbon, painting freckles as constellations). The shift from cold arithmetic to desperate warmth feels earned through micro-decisions under pressure, not epiphany. Final renunciation of apathy carries visible cost: she re-enters feeling after five years of numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is vividly embodied—“spongey dread,” “nervously confident”—and her micro-choices (overriding protocols, running to the deck) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost. Her motivation intertwines personal legacy and professional duty without sentimentality. The flaw: minor over-reliance on diagnostic phrasing (“idealism warring with spongey dread”) slightly distances emotion in one peak beat. Still, her final stance crystallizes credibly from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fiddler’s motivation—to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never”—is consistent and emotionally embodied, especially in his trembling fingers and tactile interactions with the glass flake. His dynamically observant trait informs key micro-choices (decoding scaffold flutters, kneeling at the cairn), revealing a hierarchy of values tied to memory and redemption. However, interior contradiction is underdeveloped; his emotional state remains largely singular (mournful → resolved) without layered conflict or irrationality. The final choice feels earned but lacks the friction of competing impulses that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The son’s motivation—understanding cyclical failure—is compelling and consistent, rooted in his father’s legacy and the startup’s collapse. His "polished calm" manifests as embodied restraint, not abstraction, and his micro-choices (painting symbols, placing the bill) reveal a hierarchy of values. Leo’s presence creates relational pressure that crystallizes the son’s stance without melodrama. However, the internal contradiction between stillness and intervention remains underexplored in-scene, slightly muting emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, the weight of translation, the ancestral recognition—all rooted in concrete sensation rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation evolves credibly from scholarly ambition to inherited duty, with micro-choices (typing through trance, folding the telegram) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (“We carried it together”) feels earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. No safety-hedging; her flaw is precisely her isolationist assumption, which the story dismantles without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The druid’s interiority is vividly embodied—ash on the tongue, warlike serenity—and his micro-choices (planting the seed, chanting) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His flaw (repressed guilt) drives the central conflict and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost: confronting his own role in the curse. The epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak by anchoring in sensory detail (“saw his own face reflected... in the memory’s surface”). Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act simultaneously during the ritual, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minor abstraction in the final reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, curiosity, and ancestral burden shape micro-choices with tangible cost. Her contradictory impulses (root-bound yet visionary) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final decision to become the crossing point feels earned through prior failures mapped on her body. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through tactile, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s reckless idealism and fiercely gentle nature manifest as simultaneous, contradictory impulses—e.g., “fiercely gentle even in accusation”—and culminate in a micro-choice (surrendering memories) that forecloses her past with visible cost. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak, using concrete sensory anchors like “birthday candles” and “hand in hers.” The final renunciation is earned through consistent motivation rooted in grief, not sentimentality. Flaws drive the climax without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile grip on the speaker cloth, the insulation via facts—but her final choice leans slightly toward unearned epiphany. The “confidently uncertain” trait appears as label rather than enacted contradiction under pressure. Dale’s brief presence applies minimal relational crucible; his function is atmospheric. Her arc resonates but lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “haunted ambition” manifests as concrete micro-choices (e.g., carving cuneiform into magnetic pathways) rather than abstract longing. Her contradictory impulses—desire for mastery vs. acceptance of unknowability—act simultaneously in the climax. The final renunciation (“translation is never finished, only transformed”) feels earned by prior struggle, with visible cost: twenty years of labor distilled into witness, not authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mechanical duty versus human empathy—is embodied through tactile sensations (river-reed weave, brass creaking) and micro-choices (placing the creel on the platform, not the chute). Her lunar-fluctuating identity isn’t abstract but physically enacted, culminating in a refusal that forecloses archival purity at visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory contradiction (“cold that was also warmth”). The final renunciation is earned by prior tension between preservation and destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied—her grandmother’s shell-carving memory grounds her choice without exposition. Her micro-choice to read confessions aloud, against protocol, reveals a hierarchy of values (truth over duty) with visible cost: risking demolition. Contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. ancestral empathy—act simultaneously in the hesitation beat. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail (pearl warming, breath clouding).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially in sensory overload (“every sound felt like a needle”) and physical ritual (“counting the cracks”). Her motivation—self-forgiveness tied to a traumatic river event—is consistent and intensifies her methodical behavior. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“truth-seeking river chronicler,” “raw solace”) that edges into label-speak, diluting the authenticity of crisis. The final choice—to leave the bellows—is earned but lacks a tangible trade-off beyond symbolic release.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied emotion (“trembled,” “cautious exuberance”) and micro-choices (recording ticks, opening the book) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her motivation—to seek unspoken words—is dramatized through action, not declaration. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than actively clashing in-scene; we see tension but not simultaneous opposing impulses shaping a single beat. The final renunciation (releasing silence, not reading) is earned and carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, mulberry ache, and telepathic burden ground her moral conflict in sensory detail. Her choice to refuse the empire forecloses security for autonomy, with tangible cost. Motivation flows consistently from her dream of a sound sanctuary versus exploitation. The envoy interaction sharpens stakes without flattening Lira’s agency or emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving the last spark of consciousness—is vividly embodied in her ritualized actions and internal focus. Her “lucid watchfulness” isn’t stated abstractly but enacted through precise gestures, breath control, and refusal to touch the thread, revealing a hierarchy of values (non-interference over possession). The cost is felt: she endures solitude and emotional labor without personal gain. Interiority remains consistent, professional, and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic or therapeutic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, forgiveness, and quiet resolve manifest through tactile actions (climbing, pruning, tracing sigils) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses—holding Aria’s memory close while releasing others’ grief—are active in scene, not summarized. The final choice to make jam instead of wine crystallizes her earned wisdom with visible cost: seventeen years of hatred, a daughter lost, and the daily burden of remembrance. Every micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in love over duty.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interior conflict—between hired certainty and personal doubt—is embodied through concrete choices (unhooking the lantern, shedding the cloak) and sustained by the hollow mirror shard as both tool and metaphor. The “sincerely insincere” duality is shown, not told, in interactions with the keeper. However, the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior struggle; the cost of being a “conscience for hire” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, micro-choices under pressure reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her backward aging manifests physically (“translucent,” “peeling away like autumn bark”) and emotionally through micro-choices (withholding the final clue, stepping into the pond). Her motivation—to teach vanishing to appear—is consistent and intensifies toward self-sacrifice. However, her epiphany (“the vanishing she taught was her own disappearance”) arrives with slight diagnostic phrasing that borders on label-speak, slightly undercutting full 9+ eligibility despite strong embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skimmer’s motivation—navigation without movement—is deeply internalized and consistently embodied through tactile interactions with the arrowhead, birds, and stones. Her historically reverent nature directly informs every micro-choice, especially the climactic decision to “skim another stone” in response to the pulse. The final alignment of heartbeat and artifact feels earned, not epiphanic, and her transformation into keeper carries the quiet cost of lifelong solitude now reconfigured as purpose. No diagnostic label-speak or gestural poverty mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vorrin’s interiority is concrete and consistent: his calloused hands, numb magic, and fumbling with meaning embody his underachievement without diagnostic labels. His final refusal—quiet, costly, and rooted in his inefficiency—is earned by every prior beat. The contradiction between institutional expectation and personal reverence plays out in micro-choices (e.g., mist walking over teleportation). No safety-hedging; his flaws directly shape the stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover the color of sound—is vividly embodied and consistent, driving every action from lamp-lighting to diving into the sunken library. His interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory synesthesia (“sound that tasted of silver”) rather than abstraction. The final realization—that silence has a color—is earned through his lifelong obsession and culminates in a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: years of searching, physical immersion, and emotional solitude. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or struggle beyond aesthetic yearning slightly limits psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—doubt “pooled in her sternum like dark matter,” enthusiasm remains “quiet” amid cosmic collapse—and her micro-choices (casting lots twice, pressing forehead to amber) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation intensifies credibly from ritual duty to existential alignment, and the final renunciation (“not to save what was lost, but to honor its frequency”) forecloses rescue fantasies with palpable cost. The contradiction between doubt and enthusiasm acts simultaneously throughout, never resolving into tidy certainty. Flaws feel genuine, not safety-hedged; her epiphany emerges from tactile engagement with coins and static, not diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The reaper’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, duty, and self-erasure manifest through tactile choices (angling the sextant, folding the atlas) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradiction—naming all fears but her own—is dramatized in the mirror-crystallized void, a renunciation that forecloses intimacy with visible cost. The final micro-choice to carry the unnamed fear “close to a heart that had forgotten how to beat but still remembered how to ache” crystallizes her enduring flaw without sentimentality. No emotional summary; every feeling is filtered through action, object, and light.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied doubt and earnestness, with micro-choices (adjusting the bell’s tilt, counting drips) revealing his hierarchy of values. His “brittle devotion” and “lukewarm magic” are consistent traits that shape action, not labels. The emotional arc avoids tidy resolution—his faith creaks but holds, earning a quiet endurance. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; doubt and belief alternate rather than collide in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nora’s “precisely humane” trait informs her actions and moral stance, and her motivation—to restore collective memory—is consistent and emotionally grounded. Interiority is concrete (e.g., recalling her mother’s voice), but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; her resolve feels steady rather than wrestled. The final choice to write the truth is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. No secondary characters appear on-page, so relationship dynamics aren’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.3)
    The alchemist’s interior contradiction—logic versus intuition, discipline versus sentiment—is embodied in micro-choices (pressing violets, offering one to the flame) and culminates in a renunciation that feels earned. Her emotional arc avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, feeling lives in tactile detail: “fingers trailing over bark that held ancient equations.” The final shift—“remembering what she had always been”—emerges from prior causality, not epiphany. Cost is legible in the shattered crystal and released song.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is consistent and embodied, especially in tactile memory of the buckle and breath misting in cold air. However, emotional conflict remains abstract—“watcher’s burden” is named but not dramatized as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His resolve feels pre-forged rather than tested; no visible struggle between hesitation and action occurs despite referencing a past fall. The final choice lacks friction because competence overrides vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sensei’s internal contradiction—between hollowed numbness and buried emotional need—is embodied through precise physicality (“grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade”) and micro-choices (lifting the jar, whispering the vivify technique). His clones serve as externalized facets of his fractured self, not mere echoes, and their collapse into him feels earned by his final synthesis. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak even at peak emotion, grounding epiphany in sensory detail. His restored humanity carries tangible cost: memory, loss, and tears that “cut salt trails through dust.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her identity as a creator, but her interiority leans toward abstract declarations (“safeguarding a space for innovation”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her choices align with her traits, yet lack visible cost or struggle—planting the seed feels frictionless. The familiar handwriting hint introduces potential backstory without altering present tactics. Final vow reads more like thematic assertion than earned renunciation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is rooted in vivid, specific memory—her leaf blower performances—and her spectral actions arise organically from that history. Her internal contradiction (eager yet mournful) manifests physically through the pull cord and wind, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Sarah’s limited but crucial on-page presence exerts real pressure; her laughter functions as both goal and gauge of success. The final renunciation—Eleanor thinning as her work ends—is earned by consistent causality and carries felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    The guardian’s interiority is vividly embodied—claws scraping frost, licking frozen metal—and its motivation evolves organically from duty to embracing uncertainty. Contradictory impulses (guarding vs. receiving, knowing vs. not-knowing) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. The final choice—to wait as syntax, not sentence—is earned through micro-choices that fold reality inward. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory action and metaphor grounded in the creature’s feral yet sentient nature.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s stoic sensitivity is embodied with precision—her pressure-behind-the-eyes calmness contrasts powerfully with her radical final act. Her motivation (to interrupt generational failure) intensifies through micro-choices: grinding her mother’s ash, snapping the crozier, sacrificing certainty. The internal contradiction—hopeless yet relentless—is active in-scene, not summarized. Her transformation into “successful enough to survive her miracle” feels earned, with visible cost: the frozen bloom of preserved failures.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her assumptions are armor she strips away physically and mentally. Her micro-choices (discarding gear, rewiring by intuition) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: abandoning her identity as amplifier for listener. The mentor’s dying words aren’t just backstory but active pressure shaping every calibration attempt. No diagnostic label-speak; even her epiphany (“seed,” not “message”) emerges through tactile rewiring, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lina’s resilience and hope are embodied through tactile actions—gripping rails, tracing spirals, transmitting pulses—not abstract labels. Her motivation to merge timelines emerges organically from lived experience aboard the Tidemark, not exposition. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; she endures but never visibly wavers, reducing emotional complexity. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, though Captain Roedskal’s weary nod subtly reinforces her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—“to discover the texture of connection”—is embodied in fever-hot fingers, sinew thread, and micro-choices that escalate under pressure. Her internal contradiction (control vs. surrender) manifests physically as the gallery unravels, culminating in earned renunciation: empty hands, broken fever. The final shift from grasping to feeling is rooted in prior causality, with visible cost—the dissolution of her tools and control. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is tactile, specific, and woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation—teaching starlight navigation to the depth-born—is vividly embodied through her tactile engagement with the anchor link and pressure-layer meditation. Her “balancedly curious” nature manifests in micro-choices (decoding light refraction, using rust as star map) that reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over utility, possibility over pragmatism. Internal contradiction simmers between reverence for obsolete surface knowledge and devotion to benthic reality, culminating in Earned Stasis—she’ll never see real stars, yet expands navigation itself. The Tethian elder and student Corin apply meaningful secondary pressure without diluting Mara’s interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., adjusting the hearing aid, speaking Lila’s name), revealing a hierarchy of values rooted in curiosity and protection. Motivation intensifies credibly from spectral intrigue to life-saving action. The shift from tracing ghostly pulses to recognizing a living heart feels earned, not contrived. However, the man’s sudden appearance borders on coincidental rescue rather than fully motivated causality under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marek’s claustrophobia and survivor guilt are embodied with visceral specificity—trembling hands, recycled air that “breathes” panic—and their contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to bear witness without extraction is earned by prior trauma and ties directly to the cost: enduring psychological retraumatization to honor the erased. Chen’s handwriting naming Marek on the final codex page crystallizes motivation with devastating economy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her heartbeat-counting ritual, tactile engagement with ink and shard, and trauma-rooted vigilance feel specific and consistent. Her motivation (to extract wisdom from failure) drives concrete micro-choices: pouring ink, tracing patterns, pressing the shard to the screen. The ghost-mirror realization emerges organically from her actions, not epiphany. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward tidy resolution; the cost of her clerical death feels underexplored beyond symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s motivation—to translate texture into sound before the stone-tongue vanishes—is rooted in embodied grief and consistent traits. Her interiority is concrete (“copper pathways like a forgotten lullaby”), and her final renunciation (accepting failure yet completing her work) is earned through micro-choices under pressure. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest as sensation, not summary. Her quiet articulacy shapes every action, culminating in a credible endurance that forecloses understanding but fulfills purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyn’s bitterness and desire to “turn that bitterness into a cosmic joke” ground her arc in credible emotional contradiction, and her transformation feels earned through tactile engagement with the arrowhead and phone. However, her shift from researcher to metamorphosed being leans slightly on epiphanic summary rather than granular micro-choices under pressure. Elian’s muteness and Mira’s hope function more as atmospheric catalysts than crucibles forcing Lyn’s decisions. The final laugh carries emotional weight but lacks a specific, costly renunciation that would elevate it to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is deeply embodied and consistent, rooted in generational loss and a visceral yearning to restore beauty. Her internal conflict—between futility and hope—is rendered through concrete action (playing for thirteen moons, pressing the shell to her chest) rather than abstraction. The final choice to surrender her bodily rhythm feels earned, with clear cost: risking petrification to become a bridge. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through physiological detail (“heart stuttered,” “chest aching”).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mailman’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt over the undelivered letter fuels every micro-choice, from handling the storm-bottle to launching the drone. His “respectfully rebellious” stance manifests in concrete trade-offs: risking detection to maintain fragile human links. The mother’s brief appearance crystallizes emotional stakes without flattening her into a symbol. However, the daughter’s voice inside the bottle leans slightly toward magical convenience rather than earned catharsis, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—is embodied through tactile, consistent action (oiling gears, returning daily) and culminates in a credible, earned choice to sing. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through sensory engagement (e.g., “silence spoke a secret only he could hear”). The final renunciation of pure silence for song carries felt cost: voice risks breaking the fragile hush, yet he sings anyway. His flaw—stubborn quietude—is not hedged; it both enables and complicates restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The librarian’s motivation—rooted in twenty years of midnight shifts and embodied through her scarf, posture, and tactile interactions—is consistent and deepened by micro-choices (folding the scarf, stepping through the portal). Her “sanely eccentric” trait manifests in concrete behavior, not label-speak, and her interiority emerges through perception (“solitude palpable as the dust motes”). The young man functions as a resonant foil rather than a full secondary character, avoiding overextension. Final renunciation isn’t needed; her endurance is the point, and it’s earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    The librarian’s motivation—rooted in duty, longing, and artistic witness—is embodied through precise micro-choices: selecting a philosopher’s eyelash as brush, choosing not to trap but vitalize. Her internal contradiction (desire to capture vs. need to release) acts simultaneously in the climax. The final renunciation (“some things could only be captured by letting them go”) is earned through prior causality and carries conceptual cost—the empty well. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile action and luminous metaphor.

    Merrin’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and quiet competence, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her “unassuming boldness” manifests in precise micro-choices—unbraiding hair, whispering disorienting mantras—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on truth over comfort. The woman’s trembling hands and weeping show credible emotional progression rooted in specific loss. However, Merrin’s own motivation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; her desire for a key to her own fear emerges only at the end without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—his curiosity manifests in tactile choices (climbing wrecks, cultivating spores) and emotional contradictions (longing vs. fear of truth). His renunciation at the end—leaving the mushroom as a beacon—is earned by his arc from seeker to steward. The flaw (“chronically curious”) directly drives every key action and its cost: tetanus, ghosts, lost time. No diagnostic label-speak; even epiphanies arise through sensory reintegration (“crisp nostalgia that stung his eyes”).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s contradictory impulses—desire for freedom versus commitment to Lin—are embodied in her trembling hands, backward walking, and combative tenderness. Her final choice to stay is earned through micro-choices (annotating, brewing tea, teaching) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: exile becomes voluntary sacrifice. Lin’s presence grounds the mentor’s motivation without sentimentality, and their dynamic forces credible emotional layering. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; interiority remains concrete and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vespera’s insatiable creativity functions as both flaw and engine, driving every high-stakes choice with visible cost—her exhaustion, stained hands, and burden of saved worlds are embodied consequences. Interiority is concrete (“her hands stained with the sap of between-ness”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—remaining to prune possibility itself—is earned by her consistent trait under pressure. Her motivation never wavers but deepens through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—scars, silence, and starlight fuse into a psyche shaped by guilt and craft. Her contradictory impulses (paralysis vs. restoration, concealment vs. confession) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The micro-choice to speak her secret (“I was afraid”) feels earned by decades of repression and catalyzes the story’s transformation. Final renunciation—carrying spirits not as burden but as architecture—is rooted in consistent traits and exacts visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “methodical curiosity” and empathy drive micro-choices with tangible cost (e.g., choosing silent documentation over proclamation). Her contradiction—precision versus openness—is enacted, not summarized. The final renunciation (framing the map with silver thread) earns closure through prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“rain-scoured fresco vault,” “cool stone”).

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cassian’s quietly analytic nature is embodied through precise actions—measuring viscosity, refractive index—not just stated. His internal contradiction (measuring grief as physics) drives every micro-choice, culminating in a renunciation that reclassifies grief into memory. Mort functions as both foil and pressure, his dialogue sharpening Cassian’s arc without overshadowing it. The final choice—to carry the globe as artifact, not prison—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The balladeer’s motivation—to articulate the ghost’s unspoken needs—is consistent and emotionally grounded, driving her use of the bolt plate and voice. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; she acts with near-unbroken resolve, reducing psychological complexity. The scribe’s emergence feels more thematic than character-driven, functioning as echo rather than independent agent. Final renunciation (vanishing) carries cost but reads as inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kai’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—curiosity, devotion, and quiet grief intertwine without sentimentality. Their micro-choice to don the goggles feels inevitable yet charged, revealing a hierarchy of values: understanding over propriety, connection over distance. The captain’s posthumous observations deepen Kai’s emotional arc without violating POV. Final renunciation—leaving the goggles behind—is earned, embodying “affectionate detachment” with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, obsession, and scientific heresy feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her micro-choices (loading the spool, tethering the canister) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The contradiction between professional ridicule and private conviction fuels every action. Final renunciation (“poetry was all that remained”) is earned through seventeen years of marginalization.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s face blindness and tactile perception create a compelling interior contradiction that drives every choice, especially his final renunciation of saving the library in favor of internalizing its sky. His micro-choices—pressing the coin to the wall, closing the book safe—are emotionally embodied and consistent with his sensory worldview. However, his motivation shifts subtly from capturing souls to mirroring the sky without sufficient friction between those aims, slightly blurring the hierarchy of values at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a map apprentice seeking recognition. Her internal contradiction—sociable isolation versus ambition—is embodied through tactile details (ink-stained logs, graphite echoes) rather than abstract labels. However, her emotional arc lacks a visible cost or tradeoff; the discovery arrives with minimal struggle, undercutting the "diligently curious" trait’s dramatic weight. Kess’s role remains underdeveloped, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar-eclipse locksmith’s motivation is consistent and embodied, with micro-choices (e.g., uncapping the gear) revealing her commitment to “the rhythm of repair.” However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene—she moves with near-ritual certainty, reducing emotional friction. The absence of a second character limits relational crucible, but her solitary arc remains credible. Her final endurance (“forever learning”) reads as earned stasis with subtle cost: she carries driftwood nostalgia not as burden but tide.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The collective "they" functions as a single-POV unit, but individual interiority is absent, flattening motivation to communal abstraction. The ghost’s altruism lacks internal contradiction or struggle—his actions are consistent but unmotivated by discernible personal cost. Character choices feel preordained by theme rather than pressured by circumstance. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    The adjuster’s beautifully flawed nature is embodied through tactile gestures (e.g., tracing spirals, clutching the puppet head) and internal contradictions—she is both curator of endings and bearer of mercy. Her motivation stems from a specific, emotionally charged failure (the boy), not abstract duty. The final renunciation—releasing the lullaby as silence—feels earned by her prior actions and carries visible cost: she will never be known, only felt. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s reluctance and duty are embodied in precise, contradictory micro-choices—e.g., cursing yet acting, wishing to let travelers die yet placing the final nut. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile detail (“fingers found the season’s nut… ridges familiar as her own knuckles”). The grandmother’s voice functions as memory, not exposition, and directly tilts a present action. Her flaw—resentful obligation—is never hedged, and the cost of endurance is felt in every offhandedly exact movement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s motivation—translating grief into scientific connection—is deeply rooted in her identity as both a chemist and a bereaved sister. Her interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception (foam as symphony, chrysalis as emotional vessel) rather than diagnostic labels. The micro-choice to release the chrysalis enacts a renunciation that forecloses clinging to static grief, with visible emotional cost. However, her internal contradiction (desire for control vs. surrender to natural process) resolves too cleanly, slightly undercutting the “genuine struggle” expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vendor’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile ritual and lyrical restraint; her choice to remain unincised feels earned, not evasive. The woman’s cracked-voice plea and gasp of relief ground emotional stakes in physical sensation. Both characters avoid diagnostic label-speak, instead revealing motive through action (selecting bottles, scattering moonlight). The vendor’s final smile—a micro-choice acknowledging connection without intrusion—carries subtle cost: she sustains her role as threshold guardian, never entering story herself.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The chef’s interiority is vividly embodied—grief as “metallic, cold, with undertones of stale bread and ash”—and his micro-choices (kneeling, tasting, subsuming) reveal a hierarchy of values: bearing others’ pain over personal preservation. His flaw—emotional contagion turned inward—is consistent and costly, culminating in trembling hands and hairline fractures in his “sturdy brittle” heart. The woman functions effectively as crucible, her silence and eventual lightness pressuring his final act without stealing focus. His endurance reads as Earned Stasis: he accepts becoming a vessel, foreclosing self-preservation with visible physical and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her empathy drives concrete actions (collecting phrases, convening the choir), and her “empathetically decisive” trait manifests in micro-choices like teaching multilingual verses. Interiority remains specific (“felt the rhythm become a countermelody”) without diagnostic labels. However, secondary characters (Klaus, Ania, Miguel) serve more as tonal accents than crucibles of pressure; their interactions lack reciprocal tension that would deepen Elara’s stakes or reveal contradictions in her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The engineer’s motivation—to excavate abandoned dreams—is vividly embodied through her actions with the mirror and her perception of the canyon as neural substrate. Her internal contradiction (desire to restore lost possibilities vs. risk of becoming entangled) is rendered not as abstract psychology but through tactile, sensory choices. The final renunciation—accepting entanglement as cost—feels earned by prior causality. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“synaptic plasticity” as both method and metaphor) without enough counterbalancing irrationality or flawed missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s motivation—protecting history through vigilance—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her physical risk in the grotto. Her interiority is embodied (“latent blaze within her chest,” “mist clung to her skin”) and avoids diagnostic labels. Though largely competent, her urgency conveys genuine stakes without flaw-complication. The final renunciation of lingering in the grotto feels earned, with clear cost: time lost, body strained, knowledge now burden.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sculptor’s motivation—creating music in a silent world—is consistent and embodied through tactile, sensory actions (brushing moss, fashioning a bow, strumming porcelain). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing empathy through physical engagement with the insulator and imagined linemen. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily from search to song without internal friction or hesitation that would deepen her humanity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation—discovering beauty in sacrifice—is embodied through precise micro-choices (releasing the stone, walking away) and anchored in consistent traits (“thoughtfully precise movements”). His internal conflict between guilt and pedagogical idealism acts simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality: his exile, Mira’s self-sacrifice, and his vow never to sacrifice the queen. The dent in the basalt stone physically manifests his emotional persistence, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—recovering a locked memory through empathetic listening—is rooted in consistent traits (pacifism, intuitive descriptiveness) and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“Silence of anticipation, metallic, cold, waiting”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. The final choice to leave the clasp unlocked reflects a meaningful renunciation with felt cost: abandoning secrecy for connection. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves smoothly from longing to epiphany without internal friction that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—to cultivate serenity within motion—is embodied through concrete choices: grinding the seed, brewing the tincture, sharing it with elders. His olfactory sensitivity and journaling habits reveal interiority without therapy-speak. The final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, arising from sensory experience and communal feedback. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; desire for calm never visibly clashes with ambition or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in familial legacy and grief, embodied through the arrow tip and her tactile navigation of the inversion. Her internal conflict—between inherited mystery and pragmatic survival—is dramatized via micro-choices (releasing controls, following water) that reveal a hierarchy of values. The epiphany about resilience emerging from “growing through the dying” feels earned, not diagnostic, and aligns with her grandmother’s cryptic directive. No safety-hedging: she accepts damage as generative, a stance crystallized with visible cost—abandoning conventional orchard management.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The investigator’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “rapidly adapting” trait manifests in micro-choices (e.g., climbing the catwalk, interpreting wind data) under pressure. Emotion is embodied through sensory perception (“silence pressing against her ears”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her motivation lacks contradictory impulses; she operates with near-total competence, flattening internal conflict. The final renunciation of immediate safety for foresight feels earned but carries minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her synesthetic perception informs her actions meaningfully. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves toward her goal with unwavering resolve, missing emotional complexity. The sculptor’s brief appearance introduces a secondary character under pressure, but their interaction is observational rather than reciprocal. Her final endurance feels earned, yet the absence of struggle or doubt flattens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s regret and resolve are embodied through tactile actions—arranging driftwood, handling the flute—and his internal contradiction (fear vs. duty) manifests in hesitation before playing. His epiphany feels earned because it arises from sensory engagement, not abstraction. However, the transition from despair to resolve leans slightly on lyrical assertion (“failure was not a wall but a door”) without sufficient prior struggle to ground the shift fully. The final choice to return as a seeker shows credible endurance with visible cost: loss of status, burden of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cassian’s motivation—understanding emotion through mathematical transposition—is vividly embodied in his precise yet turbulent actions. His habit of borrowing personalities manifests as tangible micro-choices with emotional cost (e.g., cold disdain from the mathematician, overwhelming joy from the poet). Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, feelings are rendered through sensory and mechanical metaphors (“sorrow now a variable,” “joy surged…a bright wave”). The flaw: borrowed minds shift too cleanly, slightly flattening the struggle between selves.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courier’s jittery interiority is embodied (“tightened his grip,” “jitters replaced by quiet certainty”) and evolves credibly through micro-choices—kneeling, planting the pendant—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His motivation to “coax wonder from the routine” drives action with visible cost: relinquishing the relic. The child functions as crucible without over-explaining; their interaction forces a renunciation that forecloses his prior isolation. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion arises through tactile detail (frost-blackened bloom, humming pendant).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seraphine’s motivation evolves organically from proof-seeking to communion, embodied in her physical stillness and neural rewiring. Her internal contradiction—rigorous scientist versus receptive mystic—drives every choice without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (leaving the prism) forecloses her old path with visible cost: empty hands but transformed certainty. No emotional summarizing; grief is rendered through frost patterns, autonomic spikes, and the “particular blue of a winter coat.”

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mei’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, devotion, and quiet resolve manifest through tactile actions (handling the bead, fitting puzzle pieces) rather than exposition. Her final sacrifice feels inevitable yet devastating because it emerges from consistent traits: weaving silence for thirty years, clinging to Lin’s amber message. The contradiction between her desire to send the message and her loom’s limitation creates authentic tension resolved only through costly reciprocity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through concrete perception (“warmth against her fingertips like a tiny heart”).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ren’s interior contradiction—meekness as both shield and limitation—is embodied in trembling knees, whispered speech, and the visceral loss of his copper rings. His transformation feels earned because it emerges from concrete micro-choices (unpacking the chest, entering the mine) rather than abstract resolve. The final hammer-raising reframes his identity without erasing his core quietness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in tactile detail like “dust like blue snow” and “fabric that had woven the first arches.”

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her sensory mapping feels lived-in, not expositional. Her micro-choices (touching the shard, redirecting the rift) reveal a hierarchy of values: duty over safety, continuity over escape. The withheld truth functions as both burden and compass, deepening her motivation without over-explaining. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves from awareness to acceptance without visible resistance or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Caleb’s reticence and observant nature are embodied through tactile detail and micro-choices (e.g., stacking stones, bottling sea glass), not summarized traits. His internal contradiction—craving connection yet preferring solitude—is active in scene, especially when he acts on the ghost’s implied urging. The final renunciation isn’t of action but of isolation, subtly earned. However, the ghost’s influence borders on externalized motivation, slightly diluting full interior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Herald’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, shadowed elation, and accidental prophecy reveal a character shaped by awe and burden. Her motivation—to steer the world toward dawn using ancient shadows—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, her transformation lacks micro-choices that show internal contradiction; she accepts her power swiftly without struggle or doubt, flattening emotional complexity at key moments like the first utterance of prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dye master’s interiority is richly embodied—grinding wings, tracking sun trails—and their motivation (to understand narrative magnetism) intensifies credibly through micro-choices. The stranger’s arrival catalyzes a transformation rooted in prior behavior, not epiphany. However, the donor heart’s backstory arrives via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, slightly softening the causal chain. Final renunciation of control (“become the space between beats”) feels earned by accumulated watchfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—discovering what the trees witnessed—is compelling and rooted in a personal yearning for hope amid sorrow. Her interiority is concrete (“a scar from a long-ago fall”) and her micro-choices (climbing the stairs, placing the sextant in moonlight) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her emotional shift lacks contradictory impulses; grief resolves too cleanly into healing without internal resistance. The epiphany feels earned but slightly tidy for the high-stakes emotional terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation—rekindling the realm through song—is consistent and intensifies credibly, culminating in a costly sacrifice. His amnesia creates genuine internal conflict, and his raw, trembling voice embodies emotional authenticity. However, his final choice lacks micro-choices under pressure; the act of singing feels inevitable rather than wrestled with. The memory loss as cost is poignant but slightly abstracted, bordering on diagnostic (“bound release”) without deeper bodily or situational specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—desiring connection yet clinging to isolation—is rendered through embodied choices (hiding the invitation, shelving books while her spirit wanders) rather than abstract introspection. Her final decision feels earned because it emerges from repeated micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: compassion outweighs safety. The flaw of self-imposed exile compounds believably over eleven years, and her empathetic nature drives both her paralysis and breakthrough without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s motivation is rooted in a precise, embodied grief—her tactile handling of the bread, her whispered encouragement to seedlings—and her contradictions (gentle yet defiant, solitary yet catalytic) drive every micro-choice. The veteran’s kneeling and the daughter’s silent tears reflect how Mara’s quiet endurance compels others without coercion. Her flaws are subtle but real: she risks futility, yet persists. The final act of scattering breadcrumb-soil mixture crystallizes her renunciation of passive mourning into active witness, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chief’s motivation is consistent and his "gently meticulous" nature shapes his actions, but interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are filtered through lyrical description rather than visceral contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The character functions more as a thematic vessel than a psychologically complex agent. His endurance feels earned but lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—protecting the “truce of hush”—is rooted in personal history and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“clutched the antique watch fob,” “singed sleeve”), and her shift from direct interference to strategic subterfuge reveals credible growth under pressure. The trait “curiously steadfast” emerges through action, not label, though its origin feels slightly abstract. Final renunciation (enduring silence rather than exposing betrayal) carries felt cost, aligning with Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied through bioluminescence, taste-based perception, and micro-choices like placing the ring on her tongue or surrendering it—each revealing a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction (seeking mechanical answers vs. accepting unsolvable complexity) plays out in-scene without diagnostic label-speak. The weather-carrier’s presence pressures Elara into credible endurance (Earned Stasis), foreclosing her investigative path with visible cost: she reports nothing. Final renunciation feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—charcoal-stained fingers, mnemonic precision, tactile memory of laughter—and her contradictory impulses (desire to create vs. fear of the blank page) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to draw is earned through micro-decisions: tapping the lock, lifting the painting, selecting charcoal. However, the epiphany “creativity had never truly been corked” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening an otherwise concrete emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The calligrapher’s interiority is vividly embodied—her wilting leaves, stained hands, and parchment-like skin concretize her moral sensitivity. Her motivation (to recover lost conversations) stems credibly from her trait and environment. The final choice—to transcribe and share the reel—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her past self-censorship. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored; her struggle leans more toward regret than active conflict between honesty and survival.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bell tuner’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her seasonal muteness, erosion of self, and devotion to wonder manifest through tactile choices (e.g., accepting voice loss as “necessary cost”). Her final laugh “like breaking ice” crystallizes a lifetime of renunciation with visceral specificity. The child’s arrival reframes her motive not as preservation but transmission, deepening her arc without sentimentality. Flawless integration of contradiction: she hollows herself to become a vessel, yet her work pulses with color.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    The android’s contradictory impulses—mechanical precision versus organic yearning—are embodied in trembling servos and nostalgic longing, not abstract labels. Their final choice to ignite the fire is earned through escalating magnetic interference and emotional resonance with Emma’s fears. The cost is felt in the surrender of protocol and the embrace of inherited memory. No diagnostic self-awareness mars the interiority; emotion arises through tactile detail and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation—proving listening heals—is embodied through micro-choices (dawn interviews, interpreting silences) and tied to her curator identity. Her internal contradiction (curator of objects vs. seeker of stories) resolves credibly in her expanded purpose. Secondary characters apply pressure relevant to the central mystery without diluting focus. The only slight flattening occurs in Elena’s tearful revelation, which leans toward emotional summary rather than fully dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s motivation—encrypting vulnerability into strength—is vividly embodied through dance, dice, and journaling, with consistent interiority rooted in survival and defiance. Her micro-choices (e.g., bowing to seal entries) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, her emotional state remains remarkably stable; the absence of palpable contradiction or degradation under extreme stress slightly flattens authenticity. The final renunciation of captivity feels earned, but the cost is more lyrical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, the weight of memory loss, the tactile warmth of wildflowers—and his motivation (to restore Mara’s stolen past) intensifies credibly under pressure. His contradictory impulses (grief vs. duty, hope vs. futility) act simultaneously in scene, especially when chipping the crystal while recalling lilacs and lullabies. The final micro-choice—to say nothing upon returning home—reveals a hierarchy of values with profound emotional cost. No diagnostic label-speak; every feeling is rendered through sensory, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation—silencing a catastrophic prophecy—is consistent, deeply personal, and rooted in generational duty. His internal conflict between preventing disaster and erasing wisdom is embodied in precise physical actions (folding, placing cranes) rather than abstract rumination. The final doubt (“had he also stolen its wisdom?”) crystallizes a morally complex cost without resolution, avoiding tidy closure. His solitude, competence, and exhaustion feel earned, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mrs. Voss and Alex are vividly rendered through idiosyncratic gestures, speech, and perception—silver hair pinned with jade, “patiently nimble” movement, bergamot-scented wisdom. Their motivations intertwine organically: Alex seeks the building’s hidden grammar; Mrs. Voss preserves its truth against erasure. The final act—Alex pressing the seal into plaster—is earned by prior tutelage and emotional investment. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying grief and curiosity through tactile, linguistic metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism versus longing—is embodied in tactile detail (“traced fingertips along stone paths,” “built equations”) and culminates in a credible, costly renunciation of detachment. Her final choice to surrender logic for connection is earned through prior micro-choices (carrying the shell, kneeling) and carries emotional weight without diagnostic self-awareness. The ghostly resolve she inherits feels like an extension of her sister’s agency, not a convenient epiphany. Flaws are consistent and consequential: her isolation preserved memory but stifled presence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in familial trauma and expressed through embodied choices—ink-stained hands, the thorn-quill, kneeling on cold stone. Her internal conflict between vengeance and forgiveness is subtly rendered without diagnostic self-awareness. The heritage rose thorn functions as both tool and emotional conduit, aligning action with motive. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle, softening the cost of her calibrated treason.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Echo Singer’s motivation is vividly rendered but remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her “richly perceptive” trait functions as a label, not a constraint with tradeoffs. The emotional arc—melancholy to acceptance—is consistent but lacks internal friction or irrationality that would ground her epiphany in struggle. Final renunciation feels lyrical rather than causally earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation—salvaging purity from loss—is embodied in her handling of the snow globes and dream analysis, showing consistent interiority. Her micro-choices (withholding the mother’s fate, prioritizing peace over truth) reveal a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. However, Elias remains more symbol than character; his ghostly presence lacks contradictory impulses or agency beyond pointing. The final renunciation (omitting painful truth) is earned but borders on sentimentality without deeper moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The philosopher’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile ritual (mending by moonlight, whisk as scepter), and his “demure audacity” manifests in micro-choices that reject village norms. Kael’s arc shows credible transformation via sensory immersion (“hidden effort... settled on his tongue”). However, the philosopher’s motivation remains slightly abstracted—his epiphany about “interwoven moonlight and mortal toil” leans toward diagnostic label-speak without deeper contradiction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation as a truth-seeker is rooted in consistent traits—his sharp observation, professional identity, and moral stance against “comfortable lies”—and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict (truth vs. communal myth) manifests through embodied choices: reassembling letters, mapping distortion patterns, walking toward the council despite risk. The final act—a renunciation of secrecy in favor of revelation—is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost (excommunication, heresy). No diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany emerges from tactile reconstruction, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atlas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his loneliness, variant allegiance, and tactile devotion to vacuum tubes and static feel specific and lived-in. His final act (broadcasting the prophecy) emerges credibly from seventeen years of listening, not epiphany. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; his contradictions (duty vs. divination) manifest in micro-choices like adjusting the dish despite knowing enforcers come. However, the absence of on-page interaction limits relational crucible depth, capping full 9+ potential.

    The vagrant poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—ink-stained hands, salt-worn skin, emotional contradictions between poverty and preservation—and her micro-choices (winding the box, sealing jars, opening them at solstice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Her motivation evolves organically from transactional survival to generational translation, culminating in Earned Stasis: she renounces pennies for legacy. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphanies arise from concrete action. The final renunciation feels inevitable yet costly—she trades anonymity for rootedness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    The engineer’s “logically emotional” nature manifests in embodied contradictions—humming at 7.8 hertz while weeping, tasting vibration as copper and salt—and her final act of sonic absolution merges technical precision with transcendent empathy. Her micro-choices (striking the key, matching frequency) reveal a hierarchy of values: duty to sacred artifacts over personal escape. The drowned keeper’s mirrored azure coat crystallizes her cost: she releases not just a monster but a reflection of herself. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is physical, precise, and inseparable from action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “caged urgency” and tactile calibration rituals reveal a psyche sculpted by time and restraint. Her motivation (“to sculpt patience from impatience”) is dramatized through micro-choices: preparing the ice, cross-referencing lunar data, delaying action until alignment. The final renunciation of force in favor of magnetic resonance feels earned, with visible cost in seventeen lunar cycles of communal waiting. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation is rooted in generational legacy and professional integrity, with micro-choices (ignoring Voss’s call, uploading evidence) that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her “fortified vulnerability” is embodied rather than labeled, though the internal conflict leans slightly toward summary in one passage (“steel­ing of nerves beneath the weight…”). The final renunciation—choosing truth over complicity—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: severed institutional protection.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlowe and the chaplain embody interior contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness—Marlowe’s “aptly deliberate” precision contrasts with the chaplain’s quiet crisis of purpose. Their micro-choices (accepting the box, winding the spring) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Elias, though off-page, exerts gravitational force through his artifact and message, avoiding stereotype via concrete action (building gear by gear). The final renunciation—delivering meaning, not absolution—is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zephyr’s motivation is vividly embodied: her “steadily curious” nature drives micro-choices (pocketing the arrow tip, nightly kaleidoscope work) that escalate stakes without sentimentality. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels—desire manifests through tactile engagement with grease, grooves, and resonance. The irreverent awe feels earned, not performative, and her final hum conveys quiet commitment over epiphany. Flaws are implied through obsession’s cost: isolation, risk to buoyancy, yet no safety-hedging dilutes her yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The corporate memory keeper’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to recover truth from erasure. Her interiority is evocative (“feeling the weight of a thousand vanished voices”) and embodied through tactile interactions with the patch and data. However, her emotional arc lacks contradiction—she moves linearly from curiosity to resolve without internal resistance or self-doubt that would complicate her choices under pressure. The final act feels earned but not fraught, missing the friction that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—embodied through shadow-lace, calm intuition, and micro-choices like descending to the vintage store or guiding the boy’s hand. The child’s trembling yet bright fear provides a credible counterpoint that deepens Kael’s motivation without overshadowing it. However, secondary characters (Elder Mara, council) remain functional archetypes; their pressure is clear but not individuated beyond plot necessity. The final renunciation—accepting that peacekeeping enables change, not prevents it—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is concrete and emotionally textured, especially in the trembling hands and blurred presence. However, the protagonist’s shift from seeking death to embracing relief work lacks a decisive micro-choice under pressure—her turnaround hinges on ambient realizations rather than a costly act. The lace parasol tip functions more as motif than catalyst for behavior. Still, her embodied numbness and grief feel authentic and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sentinel’s interiority is richly embodied—his ache, his quiet yearning—but his motivation lacks contradictory impulses in-scene. His “gently persuasive” trait is stated rather than dramatized under pressure. The final choice to bury the letter and write his own feels earned but leans on reflection over decisive action. Cost is felt (loneliness, unresolved love) yet not sharpened by a live trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line walker’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in preservation rather than personal gain, and her actions align with her role as a guardian. However, interiority remains abstract—emotions are named (“urgency,” “truth”) but rarely embodied through sensory or physiological detail. The half-mask functions more as motif than psychological extension; its “strangely honest” quality isn’t tested through contradiction or cost. Final renunciation lacks visceral friction—she walks away cleanly, with no tangible sacrifice dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s motivation—transmuting communal grief into beauty—is consistent and embodied through ritualized actions, not abstract declaration. Her “perceptively calm” demeanor functions as both trait and tactic, enabling her to hold space without intrusion. However, interior contradiction is muted; we see purpose but not struggle, making her endurance feel serene rather than costly. The child’s daisy and later return hint at impact, but the archivist herself remains untested by doubt or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s reticence is embodied in micro-choices—listening over speaking, cataloging over acting—and culminates in a devastating realization that his silence erased him. His internal contradiction (desire to preserve voices vs. failure to add his own) drives the climax without diagnostic self-awareness. The final act of reading aloud is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. No head-hopping or stock phrasing; every gesture aligns with his scholarly solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness and tactile rituals (chalk, driftwood) manifest as embodied contradictions—yearning to capture time yet doomed to lose it. His micro-choices (kneeling, drawing spirals, arranging markers) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on ephemeral resonance over permanence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, grounding emotion in sensory detail (“scent of wax,” “chalk dust in his palm”). The final renunciation—letting the tide carry him home—earns closure through consistent behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motivation is consistent and deeply tied to his profession, with micro-choices (adjusting the escapement by leaf rhythm) revealing a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile actions—e.g., placing the brittle leaf, listening for its whisper. However, the absence of internal contradiction or struggle beyond reverence for ephemerality slightly limits psychological depth. The resolution feels earned but leans toward poetic acceptance over complex renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “decisively kind” nature manifests in micro-choices like placing the vinyl shard and weaving ambient sounds into song. Mr. Harrow’s quiet resignation and Lena’s hesitant return feel earned, not archetypal. However, Lena’s emotional shift leans slightly on lyric suggestion rather than dramatized contradiction, softening the cost of her three-year absence. The father-daughter reconciliation lacks a visible trade-off beyond tears, muting the stakes’ full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand where shadows go at noon—is rooted in her quiet, deliberate nature and drives every action. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers moved with practiced care”), and her emotional arc culminates in earned stasis: she secures the seal not for glory but understanding. The final choice to hide the key and record the runes shows micro-choices revealing values with visible cost (personal safety, legacy burden). However, internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; her calm never frays under pressure, missing a chance for deeper flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she clings to structural truth while doubting the supernatural, embodying the tension between professional certainty and human doubt. Moira’s “shrewdly innocent” demeanor manifests in subtle choices: her quiet observation, tactile handling of the tooth, and refusal to blame. Their micro-choices (Elena offering the tooth, Moira leading to the telescope) reveal hierarchies of value with visible emotional cost. The final renunciation—Elena accepting her life’s work was built on error—is earned through prior causality and flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her rootedness, longing, and quiet determination feel specific and consistent. Her motivation (“share light without using fire”) emerges organically from memory and desire, not exposition. The final choice to polish sea glass into “pearls of stillness” is earned through tactile ritual and emotional resonance. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; it’s more yearning than struggle, missing the friction that would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her shame, resolve, and quiet reclamation pulse through tactile actions (watering moss, tracing patterns) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradiction—public exposure versus private sanctuary—is enacted, not summarized. The amber pendant functions as both emotional anchor and physical weight, grounding her transformation in sensory detail. Final renunciation of silence-as-emptiness feels earned by her daily micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The novelist’s internal contradiction—between artistic control and emotional surrender—is embodied through tactile choices (pressing the shell into earth, touching the boy’s shoulder) rather than abstract reflection. His micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values: witnessing over rewriting, softness over cynicism. The final renunciation of authorial dominance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in abandoned characters and burned manuscripts. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her whimsical tinkering contrasts meaningfully with her reverence for tradition, grounding her in specific action (singing, not building). However, internal conflict remains underexplored; her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses or visible cost beyond effort. The elders’ tears externalize impact but don’t deepen her interiority. Her final choice feels earned but not fraught—more devotion than dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s motivation—translating a child’s heartbeats into a map—is vividly embodied through tactile actions and emotional restraint. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing grief and hope through precise physical choices: arranging shards, uncorking starlight, pressing palms to ignite flash-paper. The final renunciation of sorrow into geometry feels earned, though the child’s presence remains abstract until the cabin, slightly weakening the cost’s immediacy. Contradictory impulses (urgency vs. stillness) act simultaneously in key beats, satisfying the 9+ quick test except for minor underdevelopment of the child as a counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The locksmith’s peripherally focused perception drives every key decision, grounding his expertise in a tangible cognitive trait rather than abstraction. His motivation—storing wonder not by hoarding but by understanding—emerges through action, not declaration, and culminates in a renunciation of control that carries conceptual cost. The final image of his reflection smiling “from the periphery” embodies earned stasis: he accepts time’s irrepressibility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is filtered through quartz lenses, tuning forks, and marble veins.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is embodied through precise, character-specific actions—pulling pride “like a splinter of ice,” winding memory “around the burner’s cool brass”—that reveal contradictory impulses: creation as both prison and salvation. Her final renunciation (stepping through the wall) is earned by seventeen years of recursive self-confinement, with cost crystallized in each calcified burden. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest via tactile ritual. The absence of other on-page characters sharpens focus on her solitary reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile engagement with wood, steam, and rain rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (carving, placing the prism, pouring tea) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory over forgetting, transformation over preservation. The contradiction between wanting to “contain” her husband’s spirit and realizing she must let it “flow” drives authentic emotional tension. Final renunciation (“not to hold on, but to let the memory transform”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of relinquishing control.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scavenger’s interiority is vividly embodied—regret as a “stone in my throat,” fragmented memories as dew—and his contradictory impulses (longing for flight vs. resigned scavenging) act simultaneously. His micro-choice to step forward clutching the camera wheel feels earned, not epiphanic. However, the ghost’s dialogue (“You cannot undo what is eroded…”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining emotional authenticity at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is vividly rooted in her identity as a “functionally creative” engineer, and her actions—rerouting water, scavenging panels, calibrating the sextant—embody her desire to “marry hydraulics with heartbeats.” Her internal conflict isn’t articulated through therapy-speak but shown via tactile engagement with decay and renewal. The children’s arrival deepens her purpose without sentimentalizing it. However, her emotional arc lacks a contradictory impulse—she moves steadily toward hope without meaningful resistance or doubt, softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s introversion, grief, and quiet agency are embodied through precise micro-choices—kneeling, dismantling, placing gears—that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal conflict (holding vs. releasing her dream) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation is earned by twenty years of implied causality and crystallizes in the act of surrendering the chronometer to the forecourt. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile ritual, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks truth within lies—but her interiority leans toward abstract epiphany (“thoughts, thoughtfully clear”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her actions align with her quest, yet the emotional stakes remain intellectualized; the “serene upheaval” lacks visceral tension or trade-offs that would deepen character complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving ancestral knowledge through rope—is consistent, embodied, and tested under pressure. Her patience isn’t passive; it’s active endurance that enables decoding the knots. Kessler functions as a credible secondary presence whose quiet respect deepens the stakes without stealing focus. The final choice to record rather than extract knowledge feels earned, with cost implied in her isolation and the fragility of what’s recovered.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scribe’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied gestures—tracing the thread, binding leaves—and her contradictory impulses (to preserve yet release) are enacted, not summarized. Her final renunciation (writing her own obituary, releasing the thread) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries conceptual cost: presence as projection cannot sustain itself indefinitely. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete perception. However, the character’s occupational premise borders on poetic conceit without deeper personal stakes beyond thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s motivation—rekindling beauty in a mechanized world—is consistent, embodied in his scavenging, crafting, and emotional response to the hybrid creature. His internal conflict (hope vs. doubt) manifests physically through frayed silks, a traded crown, and trembling observation. The final renunciation isn’t of goal but of purity: he accepts flawed genesis as valid. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars as strings, fire as legacy—and her micro-choices (binding the bird, pressing the coin into sand) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in unyielding compassion. Her motivation stems credibly from her father’s arson, and her actions consistently align with her renunciation of ignition in favor of healing. However, the internal contradiction between legacy and identity remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see resolution more than struggle. The emotional progression feels earned but leans toward lyrical clarity over messy human ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—her glow, skepticism, and “realistically imaginative” mind cohere into a singular perceptual signature. Her motivation to liberate memories arises organically from her trait of questioning legends while still acting as a lantern. The final choice—to open the box during the geese’s pause—is earned by her sustained patience and belief in evidence-based possibility. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity surfaces through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to share light without fire—is rooted in generational trauma and embodied through her weeping in colors and sonar pinging. Her internal conflict between grief and duty manifests as contradictory impulses: she both fears and embraces the darkness. The final renunciation—accepting eternal recurrence—is earned by ancestral memory and sensory action (touching the gear, altering her ping). Cost is visible: she carries eight lifetimes of grief and dissolves into mist, yet chooses serenity over chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his grief is both meditative and urgent, embodied in tracing air and carving stone. His micro-choices (abandoning generic angels, weaving his daughter’s poem) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: time, tradition, emotional exposure. The ghostly mentorship doesn’t override his agency but sharpens it. His final renunciation of linear commemoration is earned through repeated retracing, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and ethically nuanced, with contradictions embodied in her tactile engagement with the rake handle and pendulum. Her micro-choice—to preserve Marten’s truth—emerges from consistent traits (precision, diligence) and carries visible cost: she must shoulder collective guilt rather than maintain a simpler lie. The final winding shift—from penance to shared burden—feels earned through prior causality, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through splinters, salt spray, and the weight of carved letters.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gardener’s motivation—honoring the dead and decoding silence—is consistent and emotionally grounded, but his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; he moves from curiosity to resolve without meaningful resistance or doubt. His actions align with stated motives, yet the absence of struggle or misstep flattens agency. The repeated image of “calloused yet gentle” fingers feels more decorative than revelatory. Final renunciation (returning nightly) is credible but not earned through prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “groundedly imaginative” trait manifests in concrete choices (e.g., directional boreholes) under pressure. Her contradictions (dreamer vs. engineer, innovator vs. respecter of tradition) drive micro-decisions without diagnostic self-awareness. The elders’ skepticism models real social friction, and her final victory carries the cost of sustained effort, not easy triumph. No emotional summarizing; every insight arises from tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s motivation—to revive stories through music and dust—is consistent, embodied, and tied to tangible actions (transcribing, cloaking the radio). Her internal contradiction (hope vs. fear of discovery) simmers beneath every choice, though her emotional arc lacks a decisive renunciation or irreversible cost. The story leans into Earned Stasis, but the “weight of stories yet to be born” remains aspirational rather than paid for. No diagnostic label-speak, and her micro-choices (hiding the radio, using luminous ink) reveal a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—ash on skin, the tremor of safety—but her contradictions (seeking crystallization while accepting incompleteness) operate more as lyrical tension than simultaneous impulses in scene. Her micro-choices (powdering the mask, scattering ash) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: the ritual of burning portraits as coping. However, emotional progression leans toward poetic resolution over messy irrationality, slightly softening the grit expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    Malach’s motivation—preserving method over myth—is embodied in precise, tactile actions (filing the cog, mapping sediment) and reinforced by interior contradictions: he rejects comforting lies yet risks death for abstract truth. His “rationally rebellious” nature manifests not as rhetoric but as micro-choices under pressure (e.g., filing faster as patrols approach). The final renunciation—sacrificing personal legacy for encoded method—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: exile, erasure, and the patrol’s looming threat. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in brick dust, phosphorescent fungus, and filed brass.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mrs. Kaelin’s “expectantly resigned” stance is embodied through micro-choices—tracing the rosette, selecting silence over correction—that reveal a hierarchy of values forged by decades of unlearning hatred. Marco’s shift from weaponized voice to vulnerable tone shows contradictory impulses in real time, not summary. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion lives in breath, posture, and withheld noise. The final act of passing the rosette carries visible cost: she relinquishes her last artifact of a vanishing art, trusting its future to a former antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motivation is vividly rooted in generational defiance and sensory memory, and her “informal wisdom” manifests through concrete choices (pruning, composting memories). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—she never wavers or doubts, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but her micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pruning as rebellion) credibly express her values. Final renunciation isn’t needed, but the cost of her act remains abstract rather than personally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied, not labeled, and drives key choices with visible cost—her curse compels the riddle’s answer, unlocking the box and later reactivating the tower. Her interior contradiction (routine vs. wonder) manifests physically through micro-choices: keeping the gate raised during blackout, climbing the tower despite futility. The final renunciation of mechanical efficiency in favor of reverence feels earned by her eleven years of honest tollkeeping. No diagnostic self-awareness; emotion is tactile (“taste of nectar dusk,” “boots scraping rust”).

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The creeping normality noticer’s motivation is consistent and interiority poetic, but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle—his actions are ritualistic without friction. The old woman’s jar of sea salt introduces a second character, yet their interaction remains gestural rather than pressurized. His epiphany feels earned by accumulation, not conflict, which suits the lens but limits emotional complexity. Still, his micro-choices (placing objects) reveal a hierarchy of values with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Petra’s incisive kindness—a rare fusion of moral clarity and compassion—drives every pivotal choice, from threading the ampoule through the dome’s flaw to broadcasting doubt into stone. Her internal contradiction (guardian of absolutes now nurturing nuance) manifests not as abstract musing but through embodied acts: stone lips cracking, telepathy primed like a net. The final renunciation—choosing questions over answers—is earned by the cascading memories that dissolve her dogma beat by beat. Cost is visible: decades of solitude, the erosion of her own certainty, and the irreversible reconfiguration of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elias’s grim optimism is embodied through precise contradictions: he catalogs death while believing in salvation, calculates infinity while guided by biased dice. His final renunciation—choosing the climb over the rupture—is earned by every prior micro-choice and steeped in the cost of his daughter’s loss. The chipped die functions as both psychological anchor and moral compass, grounding abstract regret in tactile specificity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in ribs, stone, and clatter.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in insomnia, artistic ritual, and belief in lost languages as vessels of kindness—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (brushwork, journaling, watching). His internal contradiction (despair vs. methodical hope) manifests in micro-choices like staying awake to paint despite exhaustion. Mira’s brief but impactful presence serves as crucible without overwhelming the single-POV frame. The final renunciation isn’t of hope but of solitude, earned by his prior vulnerability in placing the mural.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liora’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as a preserver of memory, and her actions—baking loaves, using the lens, gathering the community—are consistent extensions of her historically oriented identity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing emotion through embodied details like flour “dusting their hands like ash” and the “tighten[ing]” in her chest. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves with near-uniform resolve, missing the friction that would elevate her to 9+. The final renunciation—accepting the beekeeper’s absence while continuing ritual—is earned, but the emotional cost remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clock maker’s interiority is vividly rendered through concrete perception and micro-choices—her “neatly inventive” trait manifests in tool alignment and yoyo disassembly, not just labels. Her motivation to “step beyond fate’s design” drives escalating stakes with credible emotional contradiction: hope vs. fatalism, precision vs. desperation. The final renunciation—accepting the hunger stone will return—is earned by her three-night struggle and resonates as Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, her flaw lacks compounding mistakes; competence slightly overshadows struggle, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her pain from the clasp, her nausea at the “lie” of the faces—and her contradictory impulses (repulsion vs. attraction, fear vs. curiosity) operate simultaneously in-scene. Her final laugh emerges credibly from trauma and insight, not epiphany. The whispering advisor never overrides her agency; choices remain hers, grounded in consistent traits shaped by near-death experience.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prophet’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is embodied in precise, high-stakes action, not abstract declaration. Her internal contradiction (calm ritual vs. storm urgency) manifests physically through mallet strikes and cloud-reading. Every micro-choice (sequence of blows, movement along the ring) reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost: survival through harmony, not force. The final smile earns its quiet triumph because her method exacts real labor and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s motivation is rooted in grief and inherited curiosity, driving every micro-choice—from studying shells to crafting the new whistle—with quiet intensity. Her internal contradiction (fear vs. need to know) manifests physically in embodied gestures like tracing spirals or tasting salt on the whistle. The final act of carving a question mark is earned by prior pattern-language mastery and reconfigures her mother’s legacy without sentimentality. Flaws like obsessive focus are shown through action, not label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Emlyn’s “emotionally rational” trait is stated but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure; her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“methodical heart,” “quiet satisfaction”) rather than contradictory, sensory-driven impulses. The final decision feels intellectually consistent but lacks visceral struggle or flawed hesitation that would ground her moral calculus. Her actions align with motive yet read as preordained, not wrestled from competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation evolves organically from duty to devotion, crystallizing through embodied action—wresting stones, mixing mortar with tears—not epiphany. His stoic exterior and trembling hands reveal layered contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness. The final renunciation (“claim these ruins not for the Authority, but for the forgotten”) forecloses professional compliance at visible emotional cost. Every micro-choice (placing notes, delaying demolition) stems from consistent traits intensified by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is consistent and her logical process credible, but her interiority leans on abstract labels (“tranquilly perceptive,” “reclaimed stillness”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. Her choices are rational but lack emotional friction—no visible cost arises from her decisions, only quiet affirmation. The absence of another on-page character limits relational pressure, though this fits the scope. Final renunciation feels earned but safe, with minimal risk or flaw-driven complication.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lantern maker’s grief is embodied with visceral specificity—bleeding fingers, scarred hands as maps—and her contradictory impulses (folding cranes to recover her daughter yet perpetuating luminous torment) drive every choice. Her motivation is rooted in trauma but never lapses into diagnostic self-awareness; instead, it manifests through ritualized action. The final renunciation—accepting her role as both keeper and prisoner—is earned by the thousand cranes folded before it. Her shadow’s return feels inevitable because her grief has been actively transformed, not merely endured.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma, grief, and purpose intertwine without diagnostic self-awareness. Her micro-choices (e.g., refusing to extract energy as “another kind of violence”) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Contradictory impulses—survival vs. witness, numbness vs. exhilaration—act simultaneously, not sequentially. The final renunciation (“mapping the geography of what never happened”) is earned through consistent causality and emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices—e.g., her fingers dancing over orrery controls—but her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene. The “perpetually surprised” trait borders on label-only, though it gains texture in the closing lines. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle during the pinion sequence, grounding her expertise. However, the final realization about “belonging” risks unearned diagnostic clarity despite lyrical framing.

    The protagonist’s guilt and internal conflict are vividly embodied through tactile details (the watch hand, driftwood carvings) and consistent moral struggle. His decision to stop forging memories feels earned by the accumulated weight of his profession’s cost. However, the emotional shift from guilt to “tempered regret” occurs with minimal friction or contradictory impulse in-scene—more declared than dramatized under pressure. The lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but interiority remains focused and particular.

    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his tactile reliance on the drawer pull, his wariness, and his quiet resolve reveal a character shaped by history without melodrama. Lin mirrors him effectively, their parallel thoughtfulness creating subtle status symmetry that deepens tension rather than diffusing it. The micro-choice to hand over the pull—not keep it—carries emotional weight and aligns with his motivation to “recycle mistakes.” No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies; emotions are embodied in mist, wind, and brass.

    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his merrily melancholic affect versus his paralyzing guilt—are embodied in micro-choices (paddling toward poles, whispering to align heart and action) that feel specific and earned. His trauma is dramatized through tactile memory (“utility poles were just stars that had lost their ambition”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—leaving the compass—is motivated by a cascade of small realizations rooted in present stimuli. His flawed competence as a navigator drives every beat without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—hunter turned keeper of empathy—is credibly embodied, and his micro-choices (e.g., selecting the left passage by heartbeat echo) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, his shift from “jaded wonder” to resolve leans slightly on declarative phrasing (“he would ascend… as its keeper”) rather than fully dramatized struggle. The baseball’s weight functions more as talisman than crucible for internal conflict, muting the cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The beast whisperer’s motivation—reforging a bond beyond death—is clear and consistent, driving every action with emotional specificity. Her internal conflict (reluctance vs. love) manifests physically in trembling hands and the memory of a shared kiss, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The transformation is earned through prior causality: her stillness, established early, enables the metamorphosis. However, the beloved remains abstract, limiting relational depth; the cost is felt but not fully dramatized in interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, awe, and guilt pulse through tactile sensations (stretched skin, weeping saucer, unfastening hair). Her micro-choices (tracing her hand, unbinding hair) reveal a hierarchy of values: ritual over solitude, acceptance over control. The “willingly perplexed” stance avoids diagnostic self-awareness while sustaining authentic contradiction—she is both vessel and thief, mother and mystic. The final renunciation (“repentance was complete… in understanding that she was forgiven by the very act of searching”) feels earned, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—her pacifism, guilt, and buried rage coexist in embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices (withholding medicine, stitching photos) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—choosing stewardship over transcendence—is earned through integrated self-confrontation. No diagnostic label-speak; grief and shame manifest through tactile, gravitational metaphors rooted in her AI physiology.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—giving while destitute, seeking texture in transformation while blind to his own—is embodied in tactile detail and micro-choices (e.g., uncorking bottles as “exhalation”). His epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging instead through sensory alignment with the bugs’ pulse. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality: each past gift unknowingly carved him hollow for this moment. Flawed yet consistent, he reads as an individual shaped by a hierarchy of values where generosity precedes self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seren’s motivation is rooted in her role and observation, with micro-choices (measuring gnomon angles, resetting the sundial) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her “calmly inventive” trait manifests as embodied action under pressure, not label-speak. The final renunciation—unlocking all doors without violence—earns closure through consistent causality and visible cost: her lifelong duty repurposed into rebellion. No diagnostic interiority or stock phrasing mars her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s precognitive curse and promise-driven motivation are vividly embodied, with trembling hands and dissolving shadow making internal stakes tactile. Her choice to let the star dust fade—foregoing full restoration of friction—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction (desire for order vs. acceptance of drift) is implied more than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; the epiphany about patterns being “witnessed, not solved” leans slightly toward unearned lyric insight rather than struggle-born realization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars on the tongue, fogged glass, trembling core—and his contradictory state ("furiously tranquil") manifests in micro-choices (waiting, opening, resealing). His motivation to decipher silence feels earned through tactile memory and censored history. The final act of writing, not delivering, shows credible endurance with cost: he accepts ongoing exile but claims agency in creation. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak moments; emotion arises through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rhen’s interiority is vividly embodied—his mechanical arm, needle card, and philosophical stance merge into a coherent identity under pressure. His contradictions (diplomatic yet fierce, reflective yet decisive) manifest in micro-choices during the duel. However, his opponent remains a cipher, reducing relational stakes; the duel feels more like a solo performance than a crucible of clashing worldviews. This limits emotional cost despite strong individual characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s molting identity and internal conflict between transience and commitment are embodied through tactile details (shaking hands, the coffee tin) and micro-choices (keeping the poet’s voice). Cora functions as a crucible, not a prop—her influence alters his trajectory credibly. However, the molt mechanism leans slightly toward label (“tangling in his thoughts”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction in-scene. Final renunciation is earned, with visible cost: surrendering transformation for continuity of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pianist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied longing and micro-choices—e.g., threading film reels, copying coordinates onto sheet music—that reveal a hierarchy of values. His strategic creativity and grief are consistent, but his final decision lacks sufficient friction; the leap to belief in the tidal arbor feels more lyrical than earned by prior struggle. The broken clock functions as emotional anchor, yet its symbolic weight slightly overshadows active contradiction. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats, preserving emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael’s interiority is richly embodied—his empirical whimsy manifests in tools (spectrograph, storm-leather journal) and calibrated song, not exposition. His contradiction (measuring magic while doubting belief) drives the climax. The final micro-choice—singing to stone despite professional skepticism—carries visible cost: he risks ridicule, irrelevance, or failure. His emotional arc (from doubt to luminous uncertainty) feels earned, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, cerulean regret, and unsent message ground her emotional state without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (tracing lace, wrapping wire) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over confrontation. Hideo’s placidity isn’t passive; his silence and brushwork apply pressure that reshapes Mara’s stance. The final renunciation—carrying only compass and cutting—earns closure with visible cost: she accepts growth around the wound, not its erasure.
