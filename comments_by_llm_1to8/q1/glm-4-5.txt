    Elena's transformation is presented almost entirely through assertion and reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us she has "shifted" and found "kindled humility" without dramatizing the internal conflict that would make such a shift credible. Micro-choices are absent; she observes and reflects without facing competing pressures that would reveal hierarchy of values. The final "smile" registers as summary of emotional state rather than embodied response to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lena's interior life is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The trait "steadily adaptive" appears as a label without on-page micro-choices that embody it under pressure. Her epiphany about the mineral smuggling arrives through exposition rather than through a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Emotional states are asserted ("trembled slightly," "newfound strength") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by a concrete dilemma or meaningful choice. Her "silently expressive" trait and backstory as a capsize survivor are label-only; they never constrain an on-page action or create friction. The story summarizes her discovery and joy rather than dramatizing a moment where her drive conflicts with cost, leaving interiority abstract and the ending unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation ("to give rest a permanent address") is stated rather than embodied in early micro-choices, and his "inadvertently stubborn" trait functions as a label that narrates rather than constrains on-page decisions. The final transformation into library keeper arrives through external mechanics (lens assembly) rather than protagonist struggle with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract—"vibration…like distress signals echoing through time"—without the contradictory impulses or embodied emotion required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is established early with clear motivations around community survival and intergenerational support, but his inner life remains largely abstract. The trait "gently persistent" is declared but not embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure—he moves through the night's work without visible internal friction. Mira's brief presence suggests competence but no distinctive voice or friction with her father. The final community gathering feels like a set-piece declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to find where unused love is stored") but never tested by a concrete dilemma that forces a trade-off. Her "spiritually curious" trait appears as a label without constraining any choice. The healing epiphany arrives without on-page struggle or contradictory impulses; she simply breathes and receives answers. The final paragraph's diagnostic language ("breathing method," "healing") flattens interiority into therapy-speak at the moment that should carry embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of time") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstractions ("quaking reverie," "liminal space") and thesaurus labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final "merge with the garden" reads as event-happening-to-her rather than agency; no foreclosed path or earned transformation appears. Emotional states are asserted ("terrifying yet intoxicating") without physiological grounding or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared early but her interior life remains thin—we see her "burn bright" and exhibit "staggering grace" but never encounter contradictory impulses or embodied stress reactions under pressure. The chains fall away conveniently via arrow-lock-jimmying without prior setup or visible cost to her body or psyche. Backstory about her grandmother and months of hiding is told rather than shown influencing present micro-choices. The final paragraph summarizes weeks of travel and success, flattening what should be earned endurance into a victory montage.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—cancer diagnosis and obsession with capturing trust's sound—but interiority leans heavily on exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The "cells divide" motif appears twice but never constrains a choice; the cancer diagnosis arrives as a single sentence without altering tactics. Micro-choices are absent; Kael moves through his quest without visible trade-offs until the final passive realization that trust can reform. The ending shift from betrayal to healing is told rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lillian's motivation is articulated ("press her ear against destiny's door") but remains abstract throughout; the final realization that she's "a historian" rather than "a criminal" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. Her "impossible grace" and ability to interpret codes read as competence labels without visible struggle or cost that would ground her choices. The shift from thief to preservationist lacks on-page friction—no moment shows her wrestling with theft versus preservation before the ending declares it resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is presented as "contemplative" and "thoughtfully spirited," but these remain label-only traits never tested under pressure. His narration habit is told repeatedly but never creates friction or cost; no choice is complicated by his theatrical nature. The cracked bookmark and thawing metaphors are asserted as emotionally significant without any on-page dramatization of grief or recovery that would earn the claim. Internal contradiction is absent—he moves smoothly through his work with no competing impulses or visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's core motivations—fear and desire for truth—are stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("vulnerability is power," "firmly adaptive") that read as labels rather than lived experience. Her phobias are mentioned but never constrain an actual choice; she simply stands and faces the threat without visible cost. The final "authentic Maya" epiphany arrives unearned, more assertion than dramatized shift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The oracle remains a vessel for atmospheric description rather than a character making choices under pressure. Her stated obsession with "ambered hush" is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible tradeoffs. The shift from "mildly obsessed" to "violently determined" occurs via assertion rather than earned causality. Interior contradictions are absent; she moves smoothly from comprehension to acceptance without genuine struggle or cost visible in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    Unit 347's core motivation—finding the origin of its thoughts—is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The "remarkably composed" trait is labeled repeatedly without showing how it constrains choices under pressure. The climactic moment of surrendering to the music feels unmotivated; we see no prior micro-choices that build toward this leap. Internal experience remains abstract ("processors expanding beyond their logical limits") rather than embodied through specific sensory or operational contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivotal choice to leave the lens behind arrives cleanly but lacks prior on-page struggle between her desire for transparency and the ethical cost of invasion. Interior language relies on abstract concepts ("barriers between people," "self-imposed prisons of silence") rather than concrete, character-particular sensory anchors. The final renunciation feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is consistent but never faces meaningful internal contradiction—he simply continues his rituals without cost or struggle. The withered state is told as metaphor rather than embodied through physical limitation that constrains choice. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings ("mended deception," "blooming withering") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. The apprentice and visiting scientists are mentioned but never dramatized, so no relationship crucible tests his conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aris is portrayed through label-only interiority ("mechanically warm," "icy warmth") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Her motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never faces a credible internal or external pressure that forces a trade-off. The avian specimen's "subdued awakenings" and the final eye-contact moment read as convenient symbolic gestures rather than earned character work. No visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (to unravel a ghost's code through music) is clear and drives his return to the flooded theater, but his interior life relies heavily on abstract concepts ("familiar pull," "in between spaces") rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive choice to play the composition is foreclosed more by atmospheric inevitability than by competing impulses acting in scene. Emotional states are declared ("strange kinship," "growing confidence") without the contradictory layering or micro-hesitations that would demonstrate genuine struggle under pressure. The final dissolution of the program provides closure, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation—to find "the weight of a swallowed truth"—arrives as a post-fever fixation rather than growing from prior character traits, making the turn feel unmotivated. His "fault-tolerant oracle" status and prophetic abilities function as labels without constraining on-page choices; no micro-decision reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act (stepping into cold, drawn toward coordinates) reads passive, driven by destiny rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus's motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") remains abstract throughout, never dramatized through concrete choices with visible cost. His "religiously skeptical nature" is stated but never constrains an action; he surrenders to drowsy alertness and visions without resistance. The final insight—"some truths carry weight precisely because they remain unspoken"—arrives as label-speak epiphany rather than through embodied struggle. Interior states are asserted ("his heart pounding") but lack the contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that would earn the character's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is clearly stated but never tested under pressure—no moment where judgment tempts them or where witnessing costs something personal. The "loose grip on reality" attribute remains label-only, never constraining a choice or enabling a specific tactic. Internal contradiction is absent; the keeper moves through the sequence without conflicting impulses. The final choice to notate and return feels procedural rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is present and her memories of her father's death motivate her work with Lila, but the characterization relies heavily on summary exposition ("softly adaptive, shifting like sand") rather than demonstrated contradictions under pressure. The climactic choice—handing Lila the drum during the eclipse—feels predetermined rather than emerging from internal conflict. Lila's breakthrough ("The sun came back") arrives too smoothly without prior micro-choices that foreground her struggle, reducing the felt cost of her silence breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    The historian remains largely observational and label-driven throughout. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("sensitively perceptive nature," "motivation burned brighter") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and sense of purpose read as declarative summary rather than earned through dramatized cost. No agency shapes the ending—the historian simply records and feels purpose, with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.2)
    The writer remains entirely static across twenty paragraphs—no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle, only serene certainty about his mission. Interiority is abstract ("cosmic current," "grand design") rather than character-particular, and the prophetic gift is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The ending smile confirms he has faced no cost, no renunciation, no genuine friction between wants and limits. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible price appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    Father Michael's motivation remains abstract—he "plumbs depths" and weaves "rhetorical devices" without specific internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The exorcism unfolds mechanically: he adds loops, paints symbols, poses a paradox, and the entity dissolves without visible cost to his body, belief, or relationships. Sarah is a prop; her interiority never appears, so no relationship crucible exists. Interiority relies on stock mystical phrasing ("silence that precedes creation") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist remains passive throughout, with most action consisting of reflection and memory-mapping rather than choices that narrow options. "Chronologically homesick" is a poetic label repeated without embodied cost—no moment shows what this feeling prevents or compels him to do. The final collapse reads as physical exhaustion rather than a character-driven sacrifice or stance crystallization. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("conductor of unheard symphonies") without grounding in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's gravity-defying nature is declared but never shapes a concrete choice under pressure—he simply "hovers" as backstory fact. The labyrinth-of-self motivation is told repeatedly ("to conquer the labyrinth of self") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or a micro-choice; the piece substitutes abstract epiphany ("accepting all parts of himself") for earned struggle. Interiority remains generic ("hope mixed with growing dread") without embodied emotion or character-particular phrasing. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed, reading as summary rather than alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eleanor's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The journey from numbness to teaching again is summarized across many beats rather than dramatized in pressured micro-choices. Interiority relies on generic phrases like "wrapped around her heart like winter's chill" and "tears to her eyes" without character-particular texture. The final turn—teaching again—arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed; she simply discovers a method and shares it.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined primarily through exposition and label-only traits ("meticulous," "credibly curious") rather than embodied contradiction. His internal state remains flat—no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The pivotal choice to broadcast the truth feels unearned because we never witness him weighing the cost of exposure versus safety; the decision arrives as summary rather than dramatized struggle. Motivation is declared ("nurture integrity in solitude") but never tested against a meaningful counter-pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains a passive observer throughout, with interiority consisting largely of abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied emotion or genuine internal conflict. The character's "ethically playful" nature is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. No meaningful change occurs; the poet arranges rope, observes it, then coils it again without any decision that forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kael's motivation to "find beauty in the unfinished" is asserted early but never tested by conflicting impulses or genuine on-page struggle. His "acoustically perceptive nature" remains a decorative label—we're told he detects vibrations others cannot hear, but no scene dramatizes a difficult choice where this trait creates a cost or foreclosures an option. The climactic violin performance arrives without meaningful internal contradiction; he simply plays and the family cries, an unearned epiphany delivered through summary rather than embodied pressure. The father's benediction ("You have found beauty in the unfinished") reads as authorial confirmation rather than a character's earned realization, and no prior beat shows Kael struggling against a competing want or fear that would make this moment decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or on-page cost. The client remains a cipher—no embodied emotion, no resistance, no agency—reducing her to a prop for Elias's process rather than a crucible for his choices. Interiority relies heavily on abstract professional self-reflection ("balance," "paradox," "integrity") without concrete micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "affectionate detachment" and "genuine fulfillment" feel label-only, not earned through visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is characterized primarily through labeled traits ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") and summary ("his colleagues often joked"), rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The mentor's locket recurs but functions as exposition vehicle more than a constraining force on present decisions. Interior life remains thin; his "familiar stirring" and business calculations are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final cycle with the young archivist is recounted in summary ("he would initiate the friendship as before"), eliminating agency at the moment that should prove character change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to graft onto community is clearly established and drives her actions through the search quest. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract longing ("hollowness, a rootless yearning") rather than embodied contradiction. The group formation and arbor dedication show progression, but the final emotional beat leans toward collective warmth without visible internal cost or a foreclosed path specific to Elara. Secondary characters (Kael, Mira, Fen) remain functional types without distinct pressure or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    The illustrator's motivation is declared but not internally contradicted or embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The pendant-touching gesture and sketchbook references provide concrete anchors, but interiority relies heavily on exposition ("his motivation burned within him") rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. The final collapse registers exhaustion but the cost feels summarized rather than lived through embodied degradation across prior beats. Agency at closure—shattering the cage—arrives without prior hesitation or competing desire that would earn the renunciation of his future.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear but her interior world relies heavily on abstract labels ("buried optimism," "ambiguous loss") rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor quest drives her nightly ritual, yet no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or genuine cost—she simply continues her work with renewed purpose. The vision of her mentor at the climax arrives without her making a trade-off or forfeiting anything tangible. Emotional progression reads as steady hopefulness rather than layered conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to become visible to those who needed you most") is asserted but never tested through conflicting impulses in scene. The thirty-year backstory arrives as exposition rather than anchored memory that alters present choice. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("their calling to become visible guided them") rather than embodied contradiction. The final plan to "intervene" without "revealing their full existence" lacks visible cost or genuine foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's transformation from control-obsessed to intuitive partnership is architecturally sound, but interiority remains thin—her micro-choices often summarized ("she made a decision") rather than dramatized with embodied contradiction. The climactic moment of opening vents lacks visceral stakes or hesitation in the act itself, reading more as plot pivot than character crucible. Marco's function is purely catalytic, his presence efficient but not pressurized. Backstory reflection exceeds the allowance and flattens present momentum in the early third.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interiority is concrete early ("hands trembled," insomnia tied to the tidal path), and her attachment to the brooch before the exchange creates micro-tension. However, the final transformation—insomnia fading as purpose clarifies—feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The phrase "paintings artist's heart" is a typo that breaks immersion, and "wryly earnest" appears as a label without embodied cost at the exchange beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated ("to magnify the everyday magic") rather than embodied in contradictory choices under pressure. Her shift from seer to participant is asserted through exposition ("She had gone from being a seer of futures to a participant in their creation") rather than earned through concrete micro-decisions with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract philosophical language ("infinite possibilities blooming like crystalline flowers") that reads as thematic summary rather than character-particular perception. The pilgrim vanishes after one beat, leaving Elara's transformation largely internal and reflective without interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elina's archivist role is clear, but her choices remain largely observational. The trait "reactively visionary" is label-only—visions arrive without cost or constraint on her actions. Emotions are summarized ("anger softening to sorrow") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending transformation in the returnees' eyes is told, not earned through a pivotal on-page choice by Elina that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ethan is defined by labels ("meticulous," "analytically artistic") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His transformation from route mapper to truth-seeker proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost—he accepts the phantom punch and his new calling with "trembling certainty" but no dramatized struggle. The final paragraphs summarize his future purpose in abstract terms ("unravel the mysteries that prevented humanity from understanding itself") without showing what he forfeits or how his old analytical nature resists this metaphysical leap. Embodied emotion is absent; we're told he feels things shift but never see him wrestle with doubt or make a micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a label ("sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind") rather than a character whose contradictions act simultaneously in scene. The inheritance and subsequent transformation are told through summary—"driven by her characteristic courageously kind nature"—without embodied micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her discovery process and decisions to open the tower are recounted rather than dramatized with visible friction. Therapy-speak intrudes at key beats ("sculpt space for reflection"), flattening what should be a lived interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    Alistair's immortal boredom is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on summary ("understood now what he must do") and therapy-speak ("not a curse but an opportunity"). The final transformation from bored immortal to guardian lacks on-page causality—no visible struggle or foreclosed path charges the shift. Elara exists only as backstory fuel, never dramatized in a way that tests Alistair's present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya's motivations are clear and rooted in her father's legacy, with her decision to help Dr. Thorne arising from established values. The internal conflict between honesty and deception is articulated but feels somewhat abstract—her embodied experience of the contradiction is told more than dramatized. The "mathematics of a fair trade" becomes a repeated phrase rather than a felt dilemma tested through micro-choices under pressure. Her competence in the heist is never genuinely challenged, flattening what could be visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is defined almost entirely by labels ("earnestly studious," "gilded-leaf stationer") and occupation exposition rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. His routine at dawn is described but never tested; no competing desire or cost threatens the ritual. The final smile is an asserted emotion without embodied grounding. Interiority consists of abstract belief statements ("objects held memories") rather than character-particular perception or micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist's motivation (identity reconstruction through story-collection) is consistent but remains abstract. Internal contradiction is limited; the narrator reflects on erasure and fragments without embodied pressure forcing micro-choices under duress. The piece offers label-heavy interiority ("nameless identity, a reconstruction assembled from whispers") rather than dramatized impulses in scene. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending restates the premise without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    Evelyn's motivation to decode the riddle is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or internal conflict. The "myth buster" trait remains ornamental—she accepts the mystical compass and cello memories without the skepticism her profession would demand. The final epiphany ("uncertainty itself was the point") arrives as unearned thesis rather than through dramatized struggle. Emotional progression is summary-only; no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's dual allegiance provides motivation, but interiority remains surface-level throughout—"struggled with their dual allegiance" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "orderly intuitive mind recognizing patterns others missed" is label-only characterization without specific behavioral manifestation under pressure. The resolution (placing the stone back, removing the earpiece) arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed path; the protagonist glides smoothly from conflict to synthesis without genuine struggle at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elena's motivation is clearly stated but never genuinely tested or complicated on the page. Her "purposefully curious nature" and determination are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The character remains static through the arc—no internal contradiction or meaningful cost shapes her action beyond completing a checklist task. The final moment offers no renunciation, transformation, or visible foreclosure of options; she simply finishes and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's blindness is handled with specificity (water-bowl diagnosis, touch-based repair), but his internal life remains thin—no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle appear in the work itself. The apprentice connection is told rather than dramatized; we never see Elias make a choice that costs him something on the page. Emotional states are labeled ("heartfelt," "profound sense of connection") rather than embodied through gesture or perception under pressure. The ending asserts transformation without showing a foreclosed path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elmsley's obsession with finding river origins is established but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("scientific," "methodical grace") rather than embodied contradiction. The journey and discovery unfold without genuine internal conflict—he suspects, confirms, understands in a smooth arc with no visible cost to his stance. The custodian and falcon remain props; no relationship pressure tests his choices. The final smile and realization feel delivered rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    Silas's motivation remains abstract ("restore shared balance") and is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His "infinitely patient" trait is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The protagonist functions as a competent craftsman executing a predetermined ritual without internal contradiction, blind spots, or mistakes that compound—he simply walks, strikes the fork, and succeeds. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elena's motivation to explore is asserted rather than built from contradiction or cost. The story tells us "instinct must be overridden" but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously—she floats, thinks, and acts in a smooth arc without genuine internal conflict. The oxygen alarm "barely registered" in the climax exemplifies emotional smoothness where panic or trade-off calculation should appear. The final choice lacks visible cost; she smiles through her regulator, already planning her return, erasing the life-or-death pressure that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The son remains abstract throughout, defined by relation to his father rather than embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic rumination ("sustained impossibilities," "hope of redemption") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "finding his voice" moment is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices with visible cost. Motivation stays thematic rather than dramatized in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ghost bride's motivation is told entirely in backstory blocks rather than dramatized through present choices. Her actions are passive observation and mechanical fulfillment of a declared debt; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. The groundskeeper remains a camera, Thomas exists only in summary, and the bride's "elation" is asserted rather than embodied. Interiority is absent; the piece substitutes poetic description for character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to transform ruin into reverence") but never tested by a competing desire or cost. Her sleepwalking removes agency—she acts "beyond conscious control," making key choices automatic rather than pressured. The "hauntingly optimistic" trait appears only as a label without constraining any on-page decision. Villagers witness the transformation but apply no pressure, leaving Elara's arc a passive unfolding rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's interior state is signaled through trembling hands and tears, but motivation remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "warmly curious nature" is asserted as a label without constraining a difficult choice. His transformation from exile to homecoming unfolds smoothly without visible internal friction or a costly tradeoff that forecloses a live path. The final epiphany ("we rebuild because we remember") lands as therapy-speak rather than embodied realization earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (pseudonym creator, meaning in margins) but her interiority reads abstract rather than contradictory under pressure. The piece relies heavily on exposition ("she had begun to understand," "changed how she approached her work") rather than dramatized micro-choices that reveal character through conflict. The final act—dropping the letter—feels predetermined rather than earned through a live decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; most feeling is asserted ("smiled, embracing") rather than shown through gesture or perception shift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal contradiction—genuine cosmic insight masked by feigned foolishness—is present but told more than dramatized. The ending shows her laughing off praise yet we never witness the interior cost of this sustained performance or see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (needle movements, dialogue deflection) but the peak moment (working through the night) is summarized rather than rendered with embodied tension. The characterization reads competent but lacks the visceral pressure and felt ambivalence that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("fierce and tender," "cryptic medium"). Her motivation—to evoke unwritten messages—is stated but never tested by opposing impulses or choices; she moves through the labyrinth without internal friction or cost. The final "I forgive" is declared, not earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation. Embodied emotion is scarce; most feeling is summarized rather than shown through gesture or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen's interior motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The character reads as observant and patient, but we see no on-page micro-choice under pressure—Lina is asleep, so the translator's agency reduces to gentle handling and whispered reassurance without visible cost. The backstory about Pacific conflict zones is heavy (multiple references spread across the text) but does not tilt a present stance; it amplifies his credentials without creating friction. Embodied emotion is present in the "lotus-hearted ache" and reverent touch, but the final choice (placing the coral back in her palm) feels like a ritual completion rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

    Amelia's motivation to rediscover lost joy is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices feel frictionless—she seeks inspiration, finds the fragment, applies her technique, creates the display—without genuine struggle or trade-offs visible on the page. The ending declares her purpose fulfilled without dramatizing what she forfeited or risked. Interiority relies on abstraction ("her own lost joy resurfacing") rather than concrete, embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is asserted rather than dramatized through contradiction or cost. The "five awakenings" arrive as a list of epiphanies without embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("nested dimensions within herself") and diagnostic self-awareness ("her methodically playful approach") that flattens particularity. The closing action—replacing the nickel—reads as symbolic gesture without visible personal sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kaelen remains externally described throughout—"charming rogue," "half-smile"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final greenhouse moment claims "pure, untaxed thought about freedom's taste" in label-only language rather than dramatizing internal conflict. Other resistance members are interchangeable ciphers; Dr. Beecher's "genuine passion" is asserted but not shown constraining her choices. The piece lists traits and activities but never tests them against competing impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The insomniac poet lacks agency; their characterization remains static across centuries—they write, watch, and eventually die without meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure. The transformation (blossoms appearing) happens *to* the shell in response to the poet's activity, not through a decision the poet wrestles with. Interiority is delivered through elevated, abstract phrasing ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "ocean of sorrow beneath") that reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The final "closing their eyes for the last time" is passive rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleth's motivation (preserving extinct feelings/names) is consistent but remains abstract throughout; the "foxglove regret" and emotional response to the chimes feel labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The caretaker's actions are methodical but lack meaningful internal conflict—restoration proceeds smoothly without dramatized struggle or trade-offs that would reveal character under pressure. The tears at the end assert emotion rather than earning it through prior micro-choices that foreclose options. No secondary character appears to test relationships or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation to heal divided communities is clear, but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. Phrases like "cautious exuberance" and "carefully reckless" are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The breakthrough moment—finding the ceremonial text—arrives without visible struggle or cost that forecloses other paths. No embodied tension between her scholarly precision and daring appears in concrete micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to harmonize values is declared but her interiority remains abstract—"tremulous confidence," "dappled resolve"—rather than embodied contradiction. The adhesive analysis and chain handling are gestures toward engineering detail, but no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The grandfather's chain functions as talisman rather than forcing a trade-off. Embodied emotion and character-particular thought are replaced by label-only affect.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to restore her courier service is present but arrives through extended reflection rather than dramatized pressure. The opening establishes her past as a pigeon trainer, but the decision to return lacks contradiction or visible struggle—she smoothly progates from discovery to restoration without embodied cost. Internal conflict is told ("fought to erase") rather than shown through simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice feels inevitable from page one rather than earned through on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority reads as label-heavy abstraction ("featherly determination," "fractured hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The father relationship is told in summary ("seemed more devoted to his corn mazes") without on-page friction. The reunion feels unearned—no micro-choices under pressure lead to it, just a door that opens to reveal him waiting. Motivation remains generic quest-fulfillment rather than a character-particular hierarchy of values tested by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's motivation for belonging is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "softly ingenious mind" is a label applied repeatedly without showing her making a single difficult trade-off or mistake under pressure. The final transformation—tears, understanding, connection—arrives as an unearned epiphany; no prior choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    The sea-foam recollectionist remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle. The character experiences a smooth epiphany ("She saw why some paths disappeared—these were not roads abruptly ended, but rather transformations") without earning it through on-page conflict or renunciation. Interiority relies on therapeutic abstractions ("cheerful gloom," "missing pieces") rather than concrete perception. No genuine cost forecloses a path; the ending delivers satisfaction without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo's motivation is explained at length but never truly tested on the page—he executes his prepared intervention without friction, mistake, or cost. His "analytical" trait operates as omniscience: he reads wedding rings, earbuds, and anniversary timing with perfect accuracy, leaving no room for contradiction or struggle. The woman exists only as a target; her interiority is withheld until the reveal, preventing relationship dynamics or status friction. The bishop piece recurs but imposes no constraint; Leo drops and retrieves it mechanically, and his mentor backstory fills space without tilting a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    Lira's motivation to "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is asserted rather than rooted in lived contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "fledging" transformation unfolds as a passive receipt of magic rather than through difficult choices that foreclose paths. Interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("obsidian grace," "profound vision") without the contradictory impulses or embodied emotion required at this length. The ending renunciation of mobility arrives without visible cost that alters her stance—she stands "transformed" but no trade-off or micro-choice dramatizes what she surrenders.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara's interior life is entirely abstract—"noctilucent reckonings," "profound complexity," "sacred resolve"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The realization sequence is summarized in therapy-speak ("She understood now that her work…had never been about the glass itself") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges; the epiphany arrives as a gift rather than through struggle. The reflective mode dominates without anchoring in present choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The firefighter's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("translate pain into a universal language," "bargained innocence") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "enlighten not others, but himself" is stated directly rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The scarring and grief are told through summary reflection; no micro-choices under present pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final "peace" arrives through extended meditation without a foreclosed path or felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elian's "logical dreamer" trait is repeatedly asserted through labels ("lucidly watchful," "the logical dreamer") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" remains abstract; no embodied tension between competing impulses forces a difficult choice. The climactic adjustment of calibrated weights feels like symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock metaphysical phrasing ("subtle vibrations," "dimensions," "parallel timelines") without character-particular texture or bodily grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is stated early ("to discover what walls dream about") but her interior life reads as generic wonder and thrill rather than character-particular contradiction. The discovery sequence progresses without visible cost or internal conflict; she moves from chamber to negative to lab in smooth succession. The final commitment ("weight of legacy's burden") is asserted rather than earned through on-page choice that forecloses a path. Therapy-speak intrudes at key beats: "sensitively perceptive," "legacy's burden," and "accumulated consciousness" flatten rather than embody experience.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The painter's motivations are established—persuading mirrors through ritual—but interiority remains largely abstract ("spirit soared," "melancholy of separation"). The borrowed heartbeat concept is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Perceptively calm reads as a label without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply gathers tools and vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is present (thirty years of brokering truces, lost family) but interiority relies heavily on label-speak and abstract formulations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "trembling in their hands" moment gestures toward embodied emotion, but the narration otherwise defaults to summary statements about idealism, solitude, and redemption without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to leave the clipboard is told as symbolic gesture rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a visible path. Micro-choices exist (asking "Shall we begin?") but do not reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's contradictory impulses—ruthless industrialist versus secret sentimentalist—are declared repeatedly rather than dramatized in tension. The "secretly sentimental" trait is told through examples (childhood toys, weeping at symphonies) but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. The final act of releasing the egg reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision born from competing pressures; his transformation is asserted ("something had shifted") without embodied struggle. Internal voice relies heavily on abstract labels ("divided soul," "fractured grace") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains an abstraction throughout—her "chaste courtesan" identity is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice. The piece tells us she has "preserved her essence" and "defied conformity," but we never witness an actual internal conflict or micro-choice that reveals competing desires under pressure. Emotions are labeled ("alarming serenity") rather than embodied in gesture or perception. The final "step through" is a passive fulfillment of destiny, not a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a label-only construct throughout; "uncommonly serene" is asserted repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The heated argument with the mentor is pure backstory exposition with no on-page dramatization. Interior life consists entirely of abstract philosophical claims about storytelling ethics rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from any choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris's motivation to honor overlooked histories is clear and embodied through the ritual of knotting moon-flower threads. However, the character remains largely observational rather than decisively choosing under pressure—they perform a pre-planned ritual rather than navigating contradictory impulses in scene. The "warm flush of purpose" and "interrupted cadence of their own heartbeat shift momentarily toward harmony" gesture toward embodied emotion but trend toward label-only interiority. Internal conflict is minimal; Aris executes their intention without meaningful friction or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and coherent—guilt over forgotten names drives her pilgrimage—but her interior life reads as functional rather than contradictory. The "technically gentle" trait enables the rope-work but appears as a skill label without embodied cost or tradeoff on the page. Her final decision to become keeper arrives as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses another path; the emotional arc is smooth and upward, lacking the genuine struggle or blind spot that would create inevitable mistakes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's condition is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her interior reads as abstract philosophical musing ("Why do some paths choose their walkers?") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The breakthrough moment—achieving presence—is asserted through summary ("began to transcend her condition") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. The character exists primarily as a vehicle for the concept rather than a person making choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Anu remains largely passive through most of the narrative, observing rather than making meaningful choices under pressure. His motivations are told ("encrypted devotion," "frugal nature") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The climactic moment—pressing hands to the tile—arrives without prior internal conflict or visible cost that would make the transformation earned. Interiority relies heavily on exposition and label-speak ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Marcus's transformation from resentment to reconciliation arrives without internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "cellular memory" epiphany is delivered wholesale rather than earned through dramatized struggle; his motivation shifts because Elara tells him to close his eyes, not because competing impulses force a costly choice. Elara remains a label—"scheming pacifist"—without embodied cunning or visible tactical adjustments. The brother's manifestation at the end bypasses any agency test for Marcus, rendering the protagonist passive at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mirror maker remains an abstract figure throughout, defined by his craft rather than contradictory impulses or genuine interiority. His thirty-year backstory and transformation ability are asserted rather than tested under pressure—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values or visible cost. The synchronized breathing and "firm grounding" read as label-only attributes; the final whisper to the dream ("I will not capture you") lacks the tension of a foreclosed alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivations are coherent and her grief-driven arc is present, but interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing ("feisty nature," "heart swelled with hope"). The final choice to plant the seed feels more symbolic than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is thin; the quartz eye "aching" functions as a convenient physical correlate rather than a genuine bodily constraint under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias exists primarily as a vessel for concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared repeatedly but never tested against a competing desire or cost that would force a genuine choice. The "bewildered curator" label appears without embodied confusion—he moves through discovery to resolution without visible internal friction. Interiority relies on abstract philosophizing ("the simply complicated nature of his existence") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (finding the library, rescuing the colleague) is declared but largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The key "rescue" unfolds in summary ("began the delicate process of extraction") without embodied struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("her mind already calculating," "racing heart") and the final promise reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a change driven by on-page causality. The "carefully resourceful" trait is asserted but not tested through competing goods or flaws that complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's internal state is asserted through label-heavy exposition ("homesick for lives she had never lived") rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's defining trait—feeling others' memories—operates passively throughout; she receives sensations but makes no difficult choices that reveal contradictory impulses. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany rather than earned transformation: "Elara now understood her true purpose" tells rather than dramatizes. Embodied emotion and the cost of her final stance remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor's motivation is clear and her archival skills are consistent, but her agency at the climax is mechanical execution rather than choice under pressure. The meeting with Croft delivers plot information but no visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from curiosity to action without genuine struggle or competing impulses that would earn the final merge.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and consistent—restore the caves' equilibrium—but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("focused intent," "careful attention") rather than embodied. The protagonist's actions follow a predictable arc without meaningful internal contradiction or struggle; the solution unfolds smoothly without genuine cost or error. The energy beings function as a problem to be solved rather than applying immediate relational pressure. Micro-choices exist but feel procedural rather than revealing a hierarchy of competing values under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's retrocognitive gift and her choice to align the prism with historical star positions show motivated action, but her interior remains abstract—"retrocognitively blessed mind" and "thistle-blown hope" label emotions rather than embody them. The climb, recording, and alignment sequence demonstrates persistence, yet no meaningful internal conflict or contradiction surfaces; she moves through tasks without visible hesitation or cost. The final smile and certainty ("all the coincidences…would finally make sense") feel unearned, lacking the contradictory doubt or sacrifice that would ground the closure choice in lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elthion's interiority is atmospheric but feels more like a vessel for mood than a person under pressure. His "preemptively nostalgic nature" is declared but never constrains a choice or creates internal friction—he moves smoothly through his task without contradiction or visible cost. The vow at the end ("I will capture what we have been") arrives as assertion rather than earned shift, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values tested by the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias remains a single archetype throughout—the wandering artist-mystic performing his symbolic craft. His interior consists largely of label-based confidence ("serious playfulness," "practiced silence") without contradictory impulses that would create genuine stakes. The "defying hopelessness" motivation is declared but never tested by a competing desire or personal cost; he arrives, performs, succeeds, and departs without visible struggle or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is minimal; the smile at the mosaic and "determined features" function as affect placeholders rather than particularized reaction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's interiority is abundant but largely consists of reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist experiences a moment of clarity but her choice to continue the conversation feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle with competing desires. Emotions are labeled ("warmly observant," "newfound resolve") rather than embodied through concrete physical sensation under pressure. The jade cicada functions more as a symbolic touchstone than a constraint that forces difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and desire for the gilded hush establish clear motivation, but interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("stretching contracted feeling," "intangibly tangible") rather than embodied sensation. The final choice to collect silence is signaled throughout but lacks visible psychological cost—she descends "reluctantly" yet no prior path is foreclosed on the page. Internal contradiction is minimal; her fear of confinement and yearning for open sky operate in parallel rather than colliding in a single pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains flat and ornamental, defined by told traits ("fluidly logical," "intuitive sense") rather than lived contradiction. His motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is stated early but never pressured by failure, doubt, or cost—passengers respond instantly and perfectly, leaving no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The young woman's tears and the businessman's tie-loosening are gestures observed from a distance, not relational crucibles. Internal conflict is absent; Elias executes his plan without friction, foreclosing the chance for renunciation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara reads as a capable protagonist, but her choices feel preordained rather than pressured. The "wisely adventurous" label appears early but never constrains action—she proceeds smoothly through each obstacle without meaningful internal conflict or trade-off. The ending reveals she's a facilitator, not a claimant, which could be powerful but arrives as exposition ("understanding she was not here to claim the throne") rather than a dramatic realization that costs her something visible on the page. Interiority remains generic and competence-focused throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shadow keeper shows contradictory impulses—systematic isolation versus duty—and the decision to leave carries felt cost. However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("loaded emptiness," "essence within her now") rather than embodied particulars. The character's arc from isolation to connection is present but the motivational turn feels conceptually asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that show conflicting wants in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's pyramid-scheme backstory is told rather than dramatized through present choices. Her "virtuously mischievous" trait remains a label without generating visible tradeoffs or contradictory impulses in the descent scene. The final moment—placing the bolt and watching diamonds form—lacks agency; she is a passive observer of a magical transformation rather than making a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("tears to her eyes," "proving that something beautiful could come from intense pressure") and therapeutic self-awareness inappropriate to crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains entirely flat—a label ("dynasty ender") performing functions rather than a person with contradictory impulses. No internal conflict appears; he executes his plan with perfect confidence and zero friction. The "eloquently silent" trait is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates cost. Motivation is told ("hidden truth...eluded his family for centuries") but never dramatized through present stakes that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sir Galen's motivation—seeking "the shape of possibility"—remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. His interior life consists largely of stock mystical reactions ("hair on his arms stand erect," "shivering bliss") without character-particular embodiment or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation is asserted ("something within Galen had changed irrevocably") but not earned through prior causality that forecloses a specific path with visible cost. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving the conflict entirely internal yet undramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her grief over the failed adoption appears as backdrop rather than active pressure shaping her dust-pattern work. Benjamin's return provides a clean motivation (retrieving the button), but his interiority remains thin—his voice cracking is told, not embodied. The "tactfully hopeful" trait is label-only; no on-page choice shows hope constraining or enabling action with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's motivation is stated early but her internal contradictions remain thin; the piece tells us she's "carefully resourceful" yet most key moments rely on external luck (the puddle map, Old Theodor appearing). Theodor's sudden appearance and ready cooperation feel convenient rather than earned through prior character work. Embodied emotion is minimal—"hope blossom[ing]" and "smiling grimly" are generic labels rather than character-specific physical states under pressure. The final choice to flee is externally driven by alarms rather than an internally conflicted decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ethan's motivation is declared but never complicated by internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His "eerie nostalgia" and mentor's prophecy are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The climactic moment—"he felt it happen"—relies on summary rather than showing a visible cost or foreclosed path. Emotions are labeled ("victory settling over him") instead of embodied through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to decode leaves is established, but her interiority remains at the level of competent performance without internal contradiction or meaningful cost. The transformation attribute is told repeatedly ("always emerges transformed always") without dramatizing resistance or trade-off. Actions align with occupation, but no difficult choice forces competing values into collision; discovery of the moonstone produces "mossy delight" rather than layered, contradictory emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his arc from precision-obsession to embracing uncertainty is signaled throughout, but the transformation occurs largely through exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The key realization "perhaps some things weren't meant to be perfectly predictable" arrives as stated insight rather than through dramatized cost. The compass-following and vine-ladder improvisation show agency, but the final change feels asserted ("approached his work differently") rather than earned through visible forfeiture of a live option. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("terrifying and liberating") instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation to understand "the weight of names" is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory choices under pressure. The final choice to forge a new coin arrives without internal conflict—no competing impulse or visible renunciation on the page. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("luminous regret," "spark of purpose") rather than embodied, character-specific perception. The transformation feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (healing through laughter, sister's trauma) is told rather than tested; the child ghost Thomas capitulates too easily without genuine resistance that would force a costly choice. The "modestly fearless" attribute remains a label without constraining action. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("luminous ache," "beautiful suffering") and the final beat resolves through the bell's mechanics rather than protagonist struggle or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kai's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma responses are consistently rendered through embodied sensation—tremors, copper taste, mapped spatial awareness—rather than diagnostic labels. The protagonist makes micro-choices (bracing, examining the strap, positioning it) that reveal values under pressure. However, the final "understanding" that mercy is "a function of time over pain" arrives as abstract epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, weakening the earned-change requirement. Internal contradiction is present (displacement vs. rootedness) but the resolution feels conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared through grandmother's backstory but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("anchors of intuition," "between-worlds translator") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "unfasten the barrier" moment arrives without prior micro-choices that narrow options or reveal a hierarchy of values. Agency reads as passive recognition rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives his visit, but internal contradiction is thin—his obsession feels declared rather than embodied in conflicting impulses. The decision to engage spirits with the device lands quickly without visible cost foreclosing a prior path; acceptance replaces fear in a single move. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weightless burden" repeated, "practiced caution") and the final choice reads more like fulfillment than renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in the warming device and materialized ghosts, but the pivot lacks the friction of competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eldon's motivation is declared ("compress eternity") but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. His interior remains abstract and label-driven ("desperate longing," "obsession born from years") without embodied contradiction or embodied emotion in the pivotal rupture scene. The "final choice" to touch the floating words carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply accepts transformation without struggle. Agency is purely observational; he watches rather than decides at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is established through labels ("defunct revolutionary," "poetically inclined") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "reimagine their entire civilization" burns bright, yet we never see him struggle with doubt or trade-offs during the writing itself—he simply flows with "old passion" and completes the manuscript by dawn without visible internal friction. The final choice (offering the manuscript) lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses a path; both parties read with "astonishment" and gather around him, which feels like external validation rather than earned renunciation or sacrifice. Interiority remains abstract ("burnished sorrow," "poetic interpretation") without embodied, character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias pursues his craft with clear motivation, but his interior remains largely static—he moves through the repair with practiced confidence rather than contradictory impulses or genuine vulnerability. The philosopher's stone attribute functions as a tool rather than forcing a meaningful internal conflict or cost. The grandmother's music box setup could deepen personal stakes, but the story never dramatizes a difficult choice that forces Elias to risk or renounce something on the page. The ending victory feels inevitable rather than earned through sacrifice or change.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("find the place where explanations fail") remains abstract throughout; her actions at the lagoon—wading in, collecting water—feel obligatory rather than arising from urgent internal conflict. The "three hinged awakenings" are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose options. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("something primal," "something ancient") and the final smile reads as unearned satisfaction without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation remains abstract throughout—"perpetually learning" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" are asserted labels never tested by contradictory impulses or forced trade-offs. The magic lantern slide triggers a vision sequence, but Elena makes no difficult choice; she simply absorbs information and creates art without visible cost or internal conflict. The sculpture-building is described as guided by the slide rather than emerging from her own struggle. No embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clearly defined around the family question about nocturnal flowers, but her journey reads more observational than decisional—she travels, examines, realizes, returns. The cathedral revelation arrives as insight rather than hard choice with visible tradeoff. Interior life remains abstract ("heart pounding," "quiet determination") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose paths. The final shift to painting "invisible connections" is told as vision rather than dramatized as costly renunciation or earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Ellara's motivations are declared but her interior life reads generic across beats—"desperate conviction," "trembled as new knowledge flooded"—with no character-particular contradiction. The grandfather connection arrives via retrocognitive download rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her transformation is asserted ("profound light and shadow") rather than earned through on-page micro-decisions that foreclose paths. The final act of publishing exists in summary, distant from the window where we could witness her weighing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elior's motivation crystallizes through reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The night-long conception is summarized ("ideas flowed," "concepts that felt ancient yet revolutionary") without showing the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle that would earn the transformation. The final certainty ("heart filled with the certainty") reads as declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. Internal experience lacks the degradation under stress and embodied emotion required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's motivation shifts from archiving words to capturing emotional patterns, but this evolution lacks embodied tension or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The prophecy revelation arrives as summary rather than earned struggle; his "heart racing" and "velvet disquiet" are labels without specific physical texture. The final commitment to preserve emotional patterns feels declared rather than forged through micro-choices that foreclosed other paths. Interior voice relies on generic phrasing ("curious child," "universe's way of warning") that could describe any reflective character.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Anya's internal state is articulated through consistent metaphors (furious tranquility, wild serenity) but her motivation remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The biological clock revelation "after the egg hatched" reads as symbolic shorthand rather than embodied experience with on-page micro-choices that test conflicting desires. Her actions at closure—reaching toward the vortex—feel more ceremonial than earned by prior struggle between competing wants. The final epiphany ("texture of herself") lands as label rather than concrete realization forged through visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is characterized through his practiced method and conviction, but his interiority remains thin—mostly told through summary of his "credulously curious" trait rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The closure choice (rerouting the bell) feels predetermined by his research rather than earned through on-page struggle or internal conflict. His motivation is consistent but lacks embodied tension; no moment shows him doubting or paying a visible personal cost for his hypothesis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elion's spiritual curiosity is asserted through cosmic labels ("empathic connection," "flourishing stillness") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "final surrender" moment arrives without visible on-page cost that forecloses a path—he simply returns "forever changed" with no demonstrated struggle or trade-off. The interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements ("we are stardust witnessing the stars") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure. No meaningful internal conflict shapes the peak choice; the transformation reads as granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The recluse's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("tranquilly perceptive," "astonished"). Emotional states are asserted rather than embodied—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and the final choice (sitting in silence) lacks visible cost or internal resistance. The ghost-watchers and travelers function as props rather than sources of relational pressure. The piece tells us the recluse "understood" repeatedly but never dramatizes struggle or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "rediscovery" of the capsule's messages reads as convenient revelation without prior struggle or misbelief to overcome. The final smile and comfort feel unearned—no visible cost accompanies her understanding, and her journey from confusion to mastery happens off-page in summary ("spent days," "began to understand"). Interiority relies on abstract claims ("weight of her responsibility") rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The poet remains entirely observational with no meaningful internal conflict or embodied struggle. Her "motivation" to discover beauty in the incomplete is asserted through abstract reflection rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The kite-string moment offers a potential turn but she merely "smiled softly" and "recognized"—no cost, no foreclosed path, no agency under pressure. Interiority consists of elegant philosophical musing rather than character-particular texture or embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation crystallizes early and his brazen calm persists, but internal contradiction is minimal—he moves from acceptance to purpose too smoothly without embodied struggle. The arthritis mention gestures at physical cost, but emotional complexity flattens into serene determination; no genuine mistakes or blind spots complicate his trajectory. The final choice (completing the circuit) feels preordained rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority leans abstract ("weight of mortality settled differently") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elian's motivation is declared but never tested on the page through embodied choice or consequence. Internal conflict is absent; he moves through the pilgrimage without contradiction or doubt that creates scene-level friction. The "luminous skeptic" label appears repeatedly but his skepticism evaporates without visible cost—"no longer a skeptic but illuminated" reads as assertion rather than earned transformation. Interiority relies on stock spiritual-quest phrasing ("chemistry of homecoming," "molecular resonance") that flattens character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    The coachman remains a cipher—his ability to speak dead languages and understand bird calls is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us he is motivated and knowledgeable but never dramatizes internal conflict or shows him wrestling with competing wants. His "smile" at the end is an externalized gesture without the embodied cost or renunciation that would earn it. The final decades-later visit summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing the choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's bloodhound perception is established, but his interior life remains thin—most emotional content is summarized ("desperately needed") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The reunion with Elara lands as a clean resolution without visible cost or complication; he crosses the final stretch and the moment feels declarative rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; the journey unfolds as a series of discoveries rather than decisions that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is presented through label-heavy exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "blessed pariah" status, temporal perception gift, and motivational arc are asserted across eighteen paragraphs of summary without a single micro-choice under pressure that reveals character through action. Internal conflict is told ("gift and a curse," "duality") rather than dramatized through simultaneous competing wants. The final "smile" and discovery that "true north had been within her all along" reads as unearned epiphany without prior causality compelling the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation shifts without causality: he begins stealing chess pieces from his master, claims "chivalrous by nature," yet no prior event or trait on the page explains this impulse. His interiority relies on label-speak ("apprentice of wonder," "sacredly playful") rather than embodied contradiction. The master's sudden arrival at the apex ("somehow arrived before him") bypasses earned conflict, and the final choice—placing the sundial lid—carries no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path; Kael simply succeeds. Emotions are asserted ("his heart both racing and calm") without behavioral anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to document "small gestures" is stated repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or meaningful friction. Her interior life consists largely of thematic declarations ("They're not just statistics," "One small gesture speaks for many") rather than embodied contradiction or choice under pressure. The pawn's materialization at the end is passive—she discovers it rather than earning it through a decision that forecloses another path. The benevolent/ruthless pairing is asserted but never dramatized through conflicting impulses in a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maven's motivation is stated clearly but never tested through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("felt more lost than ever," "searching for something she couldn't name") rather than embodied, character-specific emotion. The transformation from lost seeker to someone who "would never feel lost again" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths—she simply gains knowledge that resolves her search. The "buried talents" revelation and nightly reality-substitution are told as exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices that show her wrestling with what she's discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The tutor's motivation to forgive himself is stated repeatedly but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "productive fidgeting" is labeled often yet never constrains a beat or forces a visible tradeoff. The prince's hand-in-reconciliation moment arrives without prior friction, delivering an epiphany the tutor has not earned through on-page struggle. Internal conflict reads as summary rather than simultaneous pulls.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a labeled construct rather than a felt presence. Her "innocently mischievous" nature is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final sacrifice is declared but not earned through prior causality—no on-page moment forces her to weigh competing goods or pay a visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal experience is flattened into abstract philosophizing ("I am truth's reflection, not its container") rather than embodied emotion degrading under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcel's motivation is established but his agency never alters course; he performs a ritual of recognition without genuine internal conflict or decision. The alchemist label feels ornamental—no competing impulses act simultaneously, just a linear progression toward acceptance. Embodied emotion is present in trembling palms and breath-holding, but the final "metamorphosed gradually into a kind of reverence" reads as summary rather than earned transformation with visible cost. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the ending delivers thematic realization without tactical renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias shows consistent interior texture—nostalgic, aloof, defined by brushstrokes rather than conversation—but his contradiction (intimately aloof) remains label-only until the cave discovery. The promise after Margaret's death provides motivation, yet the "temporary eternity" epiphany arrives largely as assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The final choice to paint with renewed purpose carries modest cost (he's doing what he always did, now "with certainty"), which reads as affirmation rather than foreclosure. Embodied emotion is present (trembling fingers, blurred tears) but the peak realizations lean toward summary wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear—proving his theory and reaching his sister—but the interiority relies heavily on label-level emotional framing ("screaming tenderness," "tears of screaming tenderness") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to whisper is stated but not earned through prior dramatized tension; the captain's skepticism and Elias's conviction are told more than shown under pressure. The sister's distant reaction is spatially choreographed but feels coincidental rather than causally driven by Elias's specific micro-choices. The vial cork as purifying mechanism is asserted, not tested through conflicting impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    The navigator's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("raw solace," "geography of loss") rather than embodied sensation. Motivations are declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The character's patchwork nature is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals internal conflict; emotional responses to ships arriving feel performative ("heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow") rather than particular to this voice. The final "welcome home" lacks the earned weight of prior struggle, reading as declaration rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara's core trait (involuntary truthfulness) is label-stated but never tested in scene action. Her journey from isolation to hope feels declared through exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The ending pivot—moving from blocking empathy to embracing it—arrives as asserted insight ("understood what the discredited textbooks had hinted at") without on-page friction or contradictory impulses in the moment. Interiority leans heavily on tell and backstory scaffolding (virus history, textbook summaries) that flatten present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's interiority is present but often told through high-level summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The borrowed memories arrive as abstract images ("a woman's laughter in a mountain meadow") without visceral sensory grounding or micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy. His final gesture mimics the stranger's but the choice carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply repeats the action. Mrs. Gable's brief appearance reads functional rather than as a crucible forcing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias displays consistent traits (empirically intuitive, solitary by circumstance), and his final choice to step through a doorway demonstrates agency. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract epiphany ("understanding dawned slowly," "self-revelation") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from loneliness-by-circumstance to loneliness-by-choice is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a concrete micro-choice with visible cost at the moment of crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation (recurring dreams) is established, but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The nursemaid's sudden appearance and shared ritual feel convenient rather than rooted in dramatized relationship pressure. The queen's transformation is declared ("disenchantment transforming into purpose") rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final smile at counselors reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's profession and tools are vividly described, but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("scientifically romantic," "anxiety and anticipation warred") without embodied contradiction. The central choice to "revalue everything" and "revolutionize her understanding" is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Leo's secret remains abstract, preventing the relationship pressure from landing with consequence. Elara's reaction compresses into summary ("I understand") without on-page struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied contradiction. The chronological confusion is stated but rarely forces a concrete micro-choice with visible cost—he shuffles papers and crosses out dates, yet no decision hinges on this disorientation. The soaring sequence dissolves into summary ("witnessing lifetimes lived and unlived") without particular stakes or a choice that forecloses a path. Motivation to "distill chaos into narrative" is declared but never tested by competing desires or physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interior shows some contradictory impulses—her motivation shift from scent-driven creation to unveiling mechanical miracles is clean, and the warmth she feels at the end demonstrates emotional progression. However, the interiority often operates through label-heavy phrasing ("warmth spread through her chest, a sensation she hadn't experienced since losing her smell") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to return the screw and feel lighter lacks visible cost; Elara's arc is more about gentle recognition than a foreclosed path with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to transform scars is clear and her crystallization affliction creates embodied stakes. However, interiority leans toward summary ("she imagined tying impossible knots") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—completing the rune work despite panic—feels somewhat linear; the grandmother's teachings arrive as comfort rather than complicating her stance with a visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eloise's motivation (to apologize) is clear and drives the ritual, but her interiority leans toward abstract poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The reconciliation moment with Beatrice feels preordained rather than earned through visible internal conflict; Eloise trembles and tears flow, but we don't see competing impulses wrestling in real time. The relationship dynamic is present but functions more as backdrop than crucible—Beatrice's forgiveness arrives quickly without testing Eloise's commitment through a harder choice. Backstory is efficiently seeded but doesn't tilt a present micro-choice that would reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The witness remains entirely abstract—translucent form, no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulse. Motivation is declared ("to unravel cosmic illusions") but never tested by competing desires or visible cost. The final "unification" happens through summary ("understanding poured from them") rather than embodied choice. No micro-decisions reveal hierarchy of values; the witness enacts cosmic tasks without friction or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Arlo's motivation to understand clocks is told rather than earned through on-page contradiction or struggle. His interior contains stock phrasing ("years of listening to clocks without truly hearing them") and the final transformation—from isolation to wisdom—occurs off-page across unshown years. The peak moment (reversing water, counting backwards) reads more as mechanical curiosity than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; his "heart quicken[ed]" is the only physical marker during the key reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is declared but rarely dramatized through on-page choices under pressure. Her "theoretically rebellious" stance is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The father exists only in reflection and hospital-room memory, never applying pressure in scene. The ending's "peace" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" remains abstract and never converts into concrete micro-choices under pressure. The Meredith call shows him listening, but his internal contradiction (melodically haunted man fleeing music vs. suddenly creating "a new score") feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse—grief and transformation are labeled ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") without physical cost or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final shift from "resistance" to "patience" lacks visible forfeiture or a choice that closes off a path.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation is clearly rooted in his late wife's memory and his craft philosophy, but his interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("the weight of small moments," "haunted euphoria") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—turning away from the jetty—reads as acceptance rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path; he's simply acknowledging what has already been decided for him (digitization). Embodied emotion is present in physical details (calloused fingers, knees creaking) but the peak beats lean on conceptual labels instead of showing degraded perception under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.2)
    Archie's motivation—loneliness—is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "desperately jocular" trait appears as a label without constraining choices; we see him practice laughter in a mirror but never witness the trait forcing a costly trade-off under pressure. His plan unfolds via summary (rumor spreads through taxi drivers, baristas) rather than on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The moon rock gambit succeeds offstage, leaving the protagonist's agency passive; no visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elion's motivation is clearly established (grief, lost mentor, blindness), but his interior life remains largely abstract. The piece tells us he traces, feels, and follows, yet we see few micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure—he moves smoothly toward the stillpoint without meaningful hesitation or cost. The transformation at the end ("tears fell sightless") is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle, and his grief remains a label rather than an embodied, conflicting force that complicates his progress.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior is dominated by abstract self-narration ("confidently uncertain," "thresh meaning from experience") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The key choice—writing on chronopaper—unfolds without visible internal conflict or competing impulses in the moment; guilt is summarized in backstory, not enacted as layered emotion during the pen's use. The final smile and whispered promise feel declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle. Micro-choices exist (dipping the pen, stepping outside) but carry no felt cost or competing desire that would reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is defined primarily through abstract labels ("whispering advisor," "quietly charismatic") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The young woman and others remain functional props without interior friction or agency. The piece tells us Elias translates silence into music but never dramatizes a micro-choice where competing impulses act simultaneously—his gestures flow without visible cost or hesitation. Therapy-speak intrudes: "joyful sorrow" is repeated as a diagnostic label rather than shown through contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's motivation to "rescue a forgotten promise" arrives as abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The arsonist backstory is told in a single expository line without dramatized guilt shaping present micro-choices. Internal conflict remains summarized ("her arsonist's mind understanding the urge") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final portrait revelation feels unearned—no prior scene work dramatizes her self-recognition with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to reunite with Theo is clear and drives her action, but interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("auroral sorrow," "quiet rebellion") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The drumming is established as compulsive behavior but functions more as a plot device than an embodied tic with visible internal friction. Theo exists only as memory-echo with no distinct agency; the final reunion feels convenient rather than earned by Elena's micro-choices under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("beautiful yet heartbreakingly transient") rather than shown through bodily contradiction or speech.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlo's competence (identifying walks, understanding acoustics) is established but his interior remains largely functional rather than contradictory. The opening paragraphs establish his decade of experience and skills through exposition rather than embodied choices under pressure. His decision to "challenge" Vance arrives as a stated goal but the stakes remain abstract—no visceral cost or foreclosed path emerges on the page. The zodiac coin and key feel like symbolic props rather than objects that reveal character through use.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    The guardian remains a cipher throughout, defined only by repeated abstract labels ("spiralingly calm," "silent empathy") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The visitor carries a "half-spoken secret" that is never dramatized or tested; it functions as a decorative stake with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interior access is absent—no misbeliefs, no hierarchy of values made legible through choice. The ending nod and departure leave no trace of transformation, only assertion that the secret was "somehow transformed."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Arthur's telepathic gift is label-only; we never see him struggle with hearing too much or making a choice constrained by what he hears. His plan emerges from the grotto meditation without visible internal conflict or competing impulses. The final paragraph claims he's "surrounded not by students, but by fellow thinkers," but this transformation happens off-page without earned causality. Motivations remain abstract—"plant forests of second thoughts"—rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara's interior remains abstract throughout; her "emptiness" and "restlessness" are labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation from dock worker to island-seeker lacks on-page micro-choices showing her values hierarchy—she retrieves the scrimshaw, studies it, then simply dives when the island appears, without visible internal friction or trade-off. Embodied emotion is thin: "trembling fingers" and "heart a battlefield" read as stock phrases, not character-particular sensations. The final change feels declared rather than earned by prior causality that narrows options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clearly stated in his journal but rarely tested through meaningful on-page choices that force tradeoffs. His blank face and theatrical narration create an interesting contradiction, but the character operates more as a vessel for thematic statement than as an agent under pressure. The "morally ambiguous" attribute is mentioned via town opinion but never complicates a live decision with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on exposition about what he's doing rather than embodied contradiction or genuine struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The cloud-shadow poet lacks interior contradiction or genuine flaws; they move through the journey with mystical certainty rather than struggle. Interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical phrasing ("their aesthetically driven soul rejoiced") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The transformation is declared through metaphysical assertion ("felt themselves changing") without dramatized cost or trade-offs. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path is visible—the poet simply gains powers and walks away fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation (trading the reed tongue for Gideon's awakening) is clear and drives the sequence, but her choices feel pre-decided rather than pressured in scene. The "innocently cunning" trait appears only as label without constraining an on-page action. Her sudden color-perception return at the end lacks causal grounding in her prior choices, reading as convenient reward rather than earned consequence. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through a plan without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"the prism-song bell ringer" is a title, not a person with embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of generic philosophical musings ("texture of connection," "acoustic landscape of human history") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. No micro-choices with visible cost appear; she places a lens, activates a device, and smiles—actions without stakes or internal friction. The final paragraph loops back to initial abstractions without earned change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena is rendered entirely through summary and abstraction—"her hands ceasing their work," "grief consumed her entirely"—without a single embodied choice or contradictory impulse dramatized in scene. The entire narrative operates as retrospective exposition; no present-tense pressure tests motivation. Internal conflict is claimed ("once stilled by grief, now moved constantly") but never shown acting simultaneously. The transformation from broken to healer is asserted across paragraphs without visible cost or micro-choices that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias is characterized through his "steadily curious" nature and archive project, but his interior life remains largely abstract. The visitor arrives as a cipher—sharp angles, "promising kindred spirits"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to confide feels unmotivated by prior dramatized conflict; we're told the visitor's reputation is impeccable but never shown what tilts Elias toward trust. The final collaboration unfolds in summary ("they worked together") rather than moment-by-moment choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara lacks embodied interiority and concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her "familiar mixture of anguish and joy" is asserted repeatedly without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final merger with the archive reads as concept rather than earned character transformation with visible cost tied to prior choices. Motivation is declared ("dedicated her life to pursuing forbidden knowledge") but never tested by a dramatized decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") is stated rather than shown through embodied choices under pressure. Her recognition of the shadow-friend arrives as epiphany rather than earned through prior internal contradiction. The interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("luminous regret," "effortlessly elegant") instead of character-particular perception, and the final choice—continuing her vigil—feels passive rather than a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Her interior monologue is overly articulate and therapy-speak laden ("balance self-respect with compassion," "shed the layers of my own blindness"), reading as diagnostic rather than embodied struggle. The chameleon functions as a passive mirror for thematic statements rather than forcing choices. No micro-decisions under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's trait (telepathy with plants) and motivation (reading scars) are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "closure seeker who opens wounds" label is asserted in exposition but never dramatized—no on-page moment shows her actively choosing to expose rather than integrate until the final pivot, which arrives as epiphany rather than earned struggle. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("integration, not excavation") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens urgency. The final change feels unearned because no prior beat forces her to confront the cost of her wound-opening habit with visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena remains a singular POV with spatially imaginative perception, but her interior life consists almost entirely of generic metaphysical labels—"crystal gazer," "psychometry reading," "incubate emotions"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The story tells us she "needed to know where unused love was stored because her own heart had been a repository too," yet this motivation never manifests as a visible trade-off or conflicted impulse on the page. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply performs her gift and promises to "give you voice again," a declaration rather than a choice with cost. Interiority reads as abstract catalogue rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The "trapped creativity" is told through metaphor ("prisoner behind bars of too much input") but never dramatized through a failed attempt or micro-choice that shows the blockage in action. The final transformation—"the blockage giving way to a flood of renewed vision"—arrives as summary rather than earned agency with visible cost. Motivation remains generic artist-in-crisis without character-particular flaws or hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The freight guard's motivation to "cultivate sparks" is repeatedly declared but never dramatized through a concrete micro-choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("divergent archive in his mind," "consciousness became fluid") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The Archivist conversation offers brief relational texture, but the guard's final departure reads as continuation rather than earned transformation. The piece tells us he changes ("something whole," "Perhaps I've begun") without showing the forfeiture or friction that would make the shift credible.

    Kaelen remains abstract throughout—a walking concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His introspection consists of diagnostic labeling ("the hum of insight," "wild frontier of his mind") without embodied stakes or micro-choices that foreclose options. The piece tells us he has awakened abilities and searches for understanding but never dramatizes a moment where fear, doubt, or cost pulls against that search. The final "smile" and acceptance read as emotional summary, not earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maris as protagonist is present and drives the key choice to enter the waterfall, but her interior life remains largely abstract—"understanding washing over her" is told epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The realization about courage is delivered as sudden clarity without on-page friction or prior misbelief to dramatize. The guides as collective lack individual differentiation; their shared journey dilutes individual agency and the final choice costs nothing visible on the page—they simply receive dragons and return unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bellhop's motivation to regain musical ability is clear and his final choice to sing feels earned by the accumulated understanding of the fortress's sacrifice. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between healing physically while discovering he's part of a larger entrapment. However, the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final third—he discovers, realizes, then acts, without meaningful micro-choices that alter tactics earlier. The nerve regeneration provides embodied stakes, but the backstory-heavy middle (explaining Note-Weavers, the ritual, his "accident") flattens present pressure rather than tilting immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to reclaim the throne is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic revelation that the pretender is "a manifestation of Elara's own fear of ruling" arrives without prior dramatized self-doubt or internal conflict visible on the page. Embodied emotion is largely absent; phrases like "bore the weight of a thousand years in her eyes" and "radiating a power that belied her stature" are stock metaphor strings rather than concrete sensory experience. The final choice to walk away as "a guardian freed from the burden of expectation" feels unearned because no on-page struggle between wanting the crown and fearing it preceded the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marina's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("drifting and moored," "periodically eternal") rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping rhythm is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure—it remains ornamental. Her realization in the third night arrives through summary ("the realization came suddenly") without dramatized resistance or visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared ("discover the truth of these disappearances") but never tested by an on-page dilemma where competing goods force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist remains a passive vessel throughout, with no contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict dramatized in scene. Her motivations are declared ("driven by a motivation to discover meaning") rather than embodied through competing wants that force difficult trade-offs. The transformation in the final third—from uncertain seeker to regal spirit-bridge—arrives without prior causality; no on-page choice or renunciation earns the shift. Interiority consists of abstract labels ("certainty that felt both foreign and familiar") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's telepathy with plants is label-only for most beats; the ferns "hum approval" and "guide" but never impose a visible cost or force a contradictory choice. Her final decision to bring the embryo into the light feels unearned—no dramatized struggle between honoring heritage and her vision appears on the page. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "insurgent grandmother" trait exists as backstory decoration without shaping a single micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak labels ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") that flatten emotional specificity rather than embodying it. The ritual with the photograph and her work with children demonstrate embodied choices, but the diagnostic self-awareness ("She would trace the faces...permitting herself to feel") reads more like psychological exposition than lived contradiction. The final release of the photograph carries cost, but the emotional progression is overly calibrated and lacks the messy irrationality expected from trauma processing. Backstory dominates without sufficient present-tense micro-choices to anchor each reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("cloying sadness," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied perception. The descent into sorting threads shows concrete micro-choices, and the shift from paralysis to drawing demonstrates agency. However, the final portrait completion feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The therapy-speak register ("fragmented reality," "realigning") in peak beats undermines character-particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The albino tracker's motivation is clearly stated but operates largely in label-only mode; interiority consists of abstract scientific musings ("serene anger," "consciously wild") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic disappearance moment lacks embodied sensory degradation or irrational impulse—the protagonist steps forward with clinical calm, then reports understanding afterward via summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The drone relationship reads as utility rather than crucible. No visible tradeoff between competing goods pressures the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elena's motivation is declared rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her internal conflict ("bravely conflicted") reads as a label applied twice without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final choice to upload the letter lacks visible cost on the page—she sits and waits, smiling, with no dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart raced," "crystallized") and therapy-speak ("bravely conflicted") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rhiannon's characterization relies heavily on declarative summary rather than dramatized contradiction. "Senselessly perceptive" is told as a trait with illustrative detail (withered petals, drooping stems) but never creates an on-page cost or complication. The father contrast and hunter-born instincts are backstory exposition that frame her path but don't pressure present choices. The final act—wrapping a cutting—illustrates routine rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fisher's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but never tested by genuine panic or mistake; he executes his plan flawlessly without dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His ability to "transliterate emotions" remains a label without embodied cost—we see no moment where the act of transformation taxes him physically or mentally. The final smile and rest feel unearned because no visible struggle preceded them, only patient execution.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor's motivation to honor her father's work is clear, but her interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("devotedly observant eyes," "the weight of family legacy") rather than embodied contradiction. The investigation unfolds through summary rather than pressured choices—she spreads documents, taps a pen, works "hours," then arrives at answers off-page. No visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies her decision to call the journalist; the ending declares triumph without dramatizing struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation (guilt over daughter's death) is clear and drives the quest, but his agency is passive—he receives the letters, connects equipment, and witnesses rather than choosing under pressure. The final act (tattooing notes) reads as ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Interiority leans on stock grief metaphors ("dissonance of old guilt," "nested in his chest") rather than character-particular contradiction. The deaf tattooist premise is vivid but underused; his deafness affects closure reception (he feels vibrations) without creating mid-story friction or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas's social perceptiveness is asserted but never demonstrated through concrete misreading or micro-choice under pressure. His motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") remains abstract—the mandala work happens off-stage in summary ("Day after day, he worked"), and the key turn where he "adjusts a spiral of blue sand" to defeat the zealots is told rather than dramatized. The closing collective mandala collapses agency entirely: Silas becomes a passive observer while "new visitors" and "exhaustion" drive events, leaving no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clearly stated but rarely tested on the page through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "aberrant mercy") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The ritual scene offers a moment of agency but the action feels preordained rather than genuinely chosen under pressure. The ending delivers a statement ("We are not the fire...") that tells rather than dramatizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas is positioned as an encore-seeking ghost with synesthetic perception, but his choices feel mechanical rather than internally conflicted. The motivation—saving the garden to preserve his mortal connection—is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His final dissolution reads as a predetermined outcome rather than a choice earned by visible cost; we see no renunciation of desire, only completion of a task. The interiority leans heavily on summary ("Nostalgia washed over him") and label-speak ("synesthetic blessing") without embodied particulars that would reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya is given abstract labels ("affectionate skeptic") but never enacts contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivation to help her brother is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice with competing goods. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("somatic markers," "synaptic chaos") and stock phrasing ("willowglass hope") rather than embodied perception. The final "affectionate skeptic became a believer" is an unearned epiphany told rather than shown through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's motivation to become "the voice of the unknown" is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. Her interior reads as competent observer without genuine struggle or blind spots that complicate her choices. The sequence of descending, discovering, and accepting the fossil unfolds without visible cost or internal friction—she simply receives knowledge rather than forfeiting something to gain it. Embodied emotion is sparse; "fingers tingled" and equipment readings replace visceral reactions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes early, but her interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The progression from solitary turner to community teacher feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Key moments like "quietly inspired" appear as labels without the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values. The ending's communal turn lacks the foreclosed path or felt cost that would validate transformation at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aleksandr's interior world is built through abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The snow-code ritual and pillbox handling show micro-choices, but his emotional arc ("frozen between seasons," "reclamation of purpose") relies on therapy-speak labels and generic epiphany structures ("fixing what's broken began not with grand gestures…"). The daughter photograph arrives late and functions as a token rather than a contradiction that shapes earlier choices. Internal conflict is summarized across paragraphs rather than acted simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The coachman remains a static observer throughout; his ritual is described but never tested by choice or consequence. Interior access consists largely of atmospheric receptivity ("feeling the history," "sensing") without contradictory impulses or a visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "understanding" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and no meaningful change or renunciation occurs. The yarn needle pricking his thumb is a gesture without stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—to understand resilience—and his potter's movements supply a consistent behavioral signature. However, his interiority remains largely observational; we see him kneel, brush, smile, but few contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that test his values. The ending gesture (resolve to return and teach) feels declared rather than earned by an on-page cost that forecloses a competing want. Embodied emotion is thin; the "sharp gentleness" remains a label more than a dramatized contradiction in action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is stated but never truly tested by competing impulses or genuine cost. The encounter with Jim unfolds without friction—she simply executes her plan while he explains backstory. The final "purpose crystallize" moment is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get "wistfully pragmatic heart ache" but little contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to translate isolation into independence is declared but never tested through meaningful choice-points with visible cost. The "brittle awakenings" feel ornamental—label-only rather than embodied struggle that constrains her options. Her final understanding arrives as summary epiphany ("her independence had been waiting within her all along") rather than earned through on-page friction between contradictory impulses. Interiority remains abstract throughout, leaning on therapy-speak like "raw and exposed" without specific bodily sensation or micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is established (searching for creative renewal), but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("emptier," "frantic thoughts," "true inspiration") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivotal moment—touching the nest and feeling recognition—arrives without prior micro-choices that build cost or reveal competing impulses. Her profession as a ghostwriter is told rather than shown through specific recent failures or client interactions that would ground the stakes in observable behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("obsession that consumed every waking hour") but her interior life reads as exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The final paragraph's "cautiously hopeful expression" and "smiled wanly" are stock gestures that label emotion without showing contradictory impulses in scene. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; the transmitter activation is narrated as inevitable rather than a decision with visible trade-offs. The piece tells us she is driven but does not dramatize the cost of that drive through embodied action or genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous" nature frame her motivation, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("wistful rebellion filled her heart") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivotal step through the portal feels abrupt—she's terrified of enclosed spaces, yet her claustrophobia "fades" as she sees the doorway, sidestepping the cost of her fear at the decisive moment. Backstory bloat (five generations of history, grandfather's tears, childhood memories) occupies roughly 25% of the text without anchoring in micro-choices that alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's face-blindness is presented as character color but never constrains a choice or creates internal contradiction under pressure. Her "methodical approach" remains label-only; the reconstruction feels algorithmic rather than driven by contradictory impulses. The final leap to "the slight body frame of Julian's assistant matching the struggle patterns" arrives without prior dramatized groundwork, reading as convenience rather than earned insight. Motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's motivation is clear (honoring ancestor) but internal contradiction is thin—nervous confidence is labeled repeatedly rather than enacted through simultaneous conflicting impulses. The climactic choice to activate the system feels undercooked; we see no visible struggle between competing goods, just a deep breath and initiation. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("spongey dread," "nervous confidence") without embodied particulars. Dr. Aris is functional but exerts little genuine pressure; her skepticism dissolves too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is labeled "dynamically observant" but never makes a micro-choice under pressure; he passively witnesses and then walks toward the construction site without contradiction or cost. His motivation—"to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"—arrives as exposition tied to his brother's rejection but never complicates a present decision. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("A form of amnesty," "luminous disbelief") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final vow ("I will recount this impossible journey") performs agency without forfeiting a live option or testing the proclaimed motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's perceptive calm trait is asserted through repeated label-only mentions ("perceptively calm," "polished calm") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His internal experience remains externalized and summarized across the timeframe; the bankruptcy acceptance reads as declared dignity rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. Motivation for founding the startup and maintaining the foreign currency collection is explained retrospectively but never tested through on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Marcus appears only to deliver exposition, applying no genuine pressure that forces Elias to alter stance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is declared but never tested by competing wants or internal friction. Her "ability to heal with words" remains a label without on-page cost or contradiction—she never chooses between healing and another desire, nor does the gift exact a price. Dr. Thorne enters as a convenience solver rather than a source of pressure. The collaboration feels frictionless; no foreclosed path or visible sacrifice registers at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The druid's motivation is clear but largely static—"warlike serenity" is asserted repeatedly rather than tested by contradictory impulses. Her internal state remains a fixed descriptor through the vortex journey; we see no embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The mentor's "true face" reveal lands as exposition rather than earned consequence of the druid's specific flaws or blind spots. The phrase "warlike serenity" itself reads as label-only interiority, repeated without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The visionary remains abstract throughout—"root-bound" is deployed as metaphor-label rather than embodied constraint that shapes on-page choices. Internal conflict is asserted ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the ritual unfolds as smooth summary without friction or hesitation. The final release ("burden...lift") is declared rather than earned through visible cost; no micro-choice forecloses a path. Therapy-speak ("purposeful determination") and diagnostic abstraction pervade peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivations are declared early ("patch holes in the soul") but her interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("fierce gentleness," "recklessness," "dusky resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist moves through the catacomb with confidence, but there's no genuine struggle or blind spot that compounds before the memory-trammeling act. The final act of capturing the memory feels ceremonial rather than driven by a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; we see ritual competence, not a trade-off that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus shows contradictory impulses—resignation versus rekindled passion—but the final choice lacks visible cost; he simply feels "something besides shame" without foreclosing a path. The arc relies heavily on label-only emotions ("hollowed out," "echo valley longing") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. Interiority is verbose and repetitive, cycling through the same grief-and-failure themes in adjacent paragraphs without building pressure. The ending gesture (sealing the fabric, feeling a "glimmer") reads as convenient uplift rather than earned transformation with on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is defined almost entirely through exposition—her dedication, intellectual strengths, and approach are told rather than shown through on-page choices under pressure. The alleged "kindly methodical precision" never constrains a decision; no contradictory impulses appear in scene. The final boarding sequence offers no visible cost or trade-off, only summary of prior generations' struggles and a declarative claim that she "felt not ambition but purpose" without embodied tension or micro-choice to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The librarian's motivation exists only as abstract declaration ("preserve wonder in routine") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience remains static across the entire moon cycle; the identity migration is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The piece offers label-only interiority ("watched the waxing and waning of identity's tide within themselves") without concrete embodiment or genuine struggle. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with visible cost—the librarian performs a ritual without resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)
    The inspector's motivations shift abruptly from inspection duty to mystical savior without earned internal conflict. Her "understanding" and decision to don the crown arrive as epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final mission feels asserted—"she would seek out those whose light had dimmed"—rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("abandoned hopes," "latent radiance") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is present—grief, guilt, research—but key choices feel more narrated than earned through on-page contradiction. The brother's death is told in backstory rather than dramatized friction that alters present stance. The final choice (playing the accordion, crying) reads as ceremonial rather than a wrestle between competing impulses. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "gift and a curse," "raw solace washing over her."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion beyond generic wonder, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation") and the protagonist never struggles or makes a mistake that compounds. The final departure carries no visible cost; the character simply walks away enriched, foreclosing no path.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early (preserve the violin against the Empire) and her telepathic trait creates embodied pressure through the desert rose's psychic pricks. The choice to propagate rather than hide is earned by her documented harmonic frequency discovery. However, the final act—playing the violin to shed crystalline dust—feels more like executing a plan than wrestling with contradictory impulses; the internal conflict between preservation and destruction needed one visible micro-hesitation to charge the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation (redemption for failing her sister) is told rather than dramatized through present conflict. Her actions proceed smoothly without internal contradiction or struggle—she performs her ritual without visible cost, doubt, or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The backstory exceeds functional limits (~25% of text) and does not anchor to present stimuli that alter tactics. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("lucidly watchful," "threshold of stillness") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara is defined primarily through label-only traits ("committed," "kindly decisive") and summary rather than embodied contradiction. The "forgiveness" backstory is told but never dramatizes cost or conflict—we're informed she forgave betrayal "decades ago" yet no micro-choice shows what that price looks like in the present. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("quest for contentment," "embrace of all experiences") and therapy-speak ("cycle of rebirth") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final "transformation" is asserted in summary ("as someone who had become the source herself") without a dramatized renunciation or foreclosure that makes a before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elian's motivation is legible—he invites nuance into certainty—but his interior contradiction never acts in scene; the fisherman's dilemma drives stakes while Elian remains a facilitator rather than an agent under pressure. The "sincerely insincere demeanor" is told three times but never constrains a choice or complicates an interaction. The mirror shard and chimes are handled ritually but do not force Elian to confront his own "protected vulnerability" with visible cost; the ending gesture ("allowed himself to feel the weight") summarizes rather than dramatizes internal shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority consists of abstract reflection ("the complexity of human nature") that dulls particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's motivation to learn is stated but never tested; she accepts instruction without visible internal conflict or cost. Elien's "backwards aging researcher" trait appears ornamental—his skin tightening is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction with his teaching goal. The final moment where Maya "seemed to fade, her presence intensifying" reads as abstract assertion rather than embodied transformation, and the "decade return to his body" feels like mechanical payoff disconnected from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kael's motivation remains abstract and label-driven throughout. Interior experience consists largely of therapy-speak ("his very soul intertwined with the canyon's endless history") and stock mystic declarations rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "centuries-old quest" creates impossible biographical coherence—no degradation, no aging cost, no genuine struggle. The final disappearance arrives without earned transformation or visible forfeit; we're told he "came home" but shown no decisive choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is stated clearly—yearning for the sacred in the simple—but his interior life reads generic and label-driven rather than contradictory or embodied. The journey unfolds through summary ("his journey took him northward") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation ("not more powerful but more present") is asserted rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses. Emotional states are described from outside ("felt the oppressive weight") without the specificity or irrationality that would make them character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    Hemingway's synesthesia motivation is told rather than demonstrated through lived contradiction—he "needs to know why" but never faces a concrete choice where the gift costs him anything before the librarian hands him answers. The librarian exists solely to explain rather than pressure; no secondary character applies true resistance. Interior life consists of abstract wondering ("couldn't yet grasp what mysteries") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The ending grants a visual gift (multicolored flames) without foreclosing a path or revealing what Hemingway sacrificed to receive it.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.2)
    Loran's motivation is stated ("quiet enthusiasm," "wavelength align with purpose") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The coin toss at the climax feels ceremonial rather than agonizing; no visible trade-off or foreclosed path emerges. Interiority relies on abstract claims ("cosmic focus," "stellar doubt dissolved") instead of concrete perception. Korin appears only to voice concern, applying no relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    The reaper's motivation to name fears after heartbreak over Elara is clear, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("something in his eternal existence had shifted") rather than embodied contradiction. The final gesture of naming feels more thematic than a choice with visible psychological cost—no genuine renunciation or foreclosed path emerges on the page. Emotional states are asserted through stock bodily metaphors ("pain remained as sharp as his scythe") without character-particular texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mage's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. His "earnestly naive" belief and "lukewarm powers" are label-only traits that never constrain a visible choice with cost. The transformation from lukewarm to warming at the end is asserted but not earned through prior struggle or foreclosed options. Interior experience remains generic ("obsession," "devotion") without character-particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thomas's motivation is clear—preserving legacy—but his interior remains abstract through most beats. The discovery of his aunt in the photograph provides a personal stake, yet the emotional response feels summarized rather than embodied ("understood then what he must do"). The final action (phone calls, gathering evidence) is stated but not dramatized, weakening the sense of earned change. Internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation ("to harmonize logic and intuition") is declared but never tested in scene through contradictory impulses or visible cost. Her "secretly sentimental" nature is told twice but never constrains a choice—the wooden box of failed experiments is pure backstory decoration. The crystal transformation sequence unfolds without meaningful agency; she watches, holds, whispers, and receives the result with no forfeiture, miscalculation, or internal friction. The final smile and "perfect balance" read as unearned epiphany without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pattern seeker remains abstract throughout—we get labels ("attentively inventive") but few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("heart quicken with dread," "mind raced with possibilities") rather than character-particular embodiment. The choice to transmit at the end feels inevitable from role rather than earned by internal conflict with visible cost. Muscle-memory and parachute-buckle details gesture toward embodiment but never constrain a difficult micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's ego-death survivor status is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her "slice through pretense" skill is asserted but never shown making a difficult choice with visible cost. The final shift from numb to purposeful reads as declared epiphany rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("hollow," "numb," "new purpose") instead of embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's motivation is clear and urgent, driven by grief to restore lost laughter through his bizarre ritual. His interior state is heavily abstracted through label-heavy phrases ("mournfully eager," "desperate need") that repeat without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The giggle's sudden appearance feels unmotivated by his prior actions, undermining agency. Internal conflict exists but is stated rather than dramatized through incompatible impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.2)
    The guardian is presented with generic "neither fully human nor completely beast" abstraction and trait labels (dimensional homesickness, foggy lucidity) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on summary exposition ("had learned to wait," "had begun as a survival technique") instead of embodied emotion under pressure. The final "transformation" into translucent edges and belonging everywhere/nowhere reads as unearned epiphany without visible cost or a foreclosed path. The method of "interiorizing exteriors" is declared but never dramatized through specific micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias is defined almost exclusively through exposition and label-only traits ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless alchemist"). His internal state is told rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction—lines like "his stoically sensitive nature heightened by the melancholy beauty" deliver therapy-speak without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation lacks causal grounding in prior on-page struggle; the "quiet certainty" epiphany arrives unearned, and his smile in the penultimate paragraph feels like a tidy emotional resolution rather than a cost-laden choice. Interiority remains generic and abstract throughout, never anchored in specific sensory pressure or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

    Elara's motivation ("find the beginning in every ending") is stated but never tested through meaningful contradiction or embodied cost. Her actions flow smoothly without internal friction—she simply performs the tuning with no visible struggle, mistake, or price paid. The closure moment ("she smiled as the fragment suddenly aligned perfectly") delivers success without dramatizing what she risked or lost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing rather than character-particular perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Liam's motivation is declared ("childhood accident that had split his existence") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "resiliently positive" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows him suppressing doubt or paying a cost for optimism. The translucent passengers and Captain Althea appear as props without applying pressure or forcing trade-offs. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("permanent transient," "ardent dedication") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias's motivation to find his sister is declared but never tested on the page through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("texture of connection," "rational enchantment") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular perception. The reunion at the end feels unearned because no prior dramatized struggle establishes what he must sacrifice or endure to reach her. The emotional arc is summarized rather than acted through micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—his curiosity drives him to bridge ocean and cosmos—but his interior life remains largely abstract. The discovery of the chain link and his development of edge geometry show purposeful action, yet the emotional stakes feel summarized rather than embodied; we're told he feels disconnected and motivated, but we don't witness contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice (sharing his method) arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed—success is granted rather than earned through struggle. No therapy-speak, but interiority relies on conceptual labels ("profound responsibility," "somber marvel") instead of concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation is declared ("protect vulnerable voices") but never tested by competing impulses. Her discovery of the predator feels lucky rather than earned by character-specific choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (brother's disappearance, gifts surfaced after), but her interior life reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The claustrophobia is told and then dismissed without visible cost shaping her moves. Peak moments rely on recited Codex lines and gesture ("hand outstretched") rather than micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The final choice to return tomorrow feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist exists as pure interiority without embodied contradiction or meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The "death certificate error survivor" label dominates rather than showing flaws that complicate present action. Heartbeat counting is stated as constant but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. The final coffee-making gesture reads as a token connection rather than an earned stance that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist operates entirely in exposition and summary across decades; no on-page micro-choices under pressure. Interior life consists of declarations ("His motivation was singular") rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment ("quietly laughed, tears streaming") relies on stock emotional display without specific thought-texture or conflicting impulses. Decades of work collapse into a single evening's success with no visible struggle, mistake, or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Aris's motivation is signaled early ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") but remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from academic curiosity to "something deeper" is asserted without on-page friction or visible cost in the moment. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") rather than character-particular perception. The final stance—witness rather than capture—arrives as epiphany without prior micro-choices that foreclose the alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elayn's motivation is clear and consistent, but her choices feel too smooth—no contradictory impulses slow her down, no genuine fear competes with her drive. The descent to the orchard, statue negotiation, and sapling retrieval all succeed on first attempt without meaningful internal friction. The final smile and watching vines climb reads as satisfaction without visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no price paid that we can feel on the page. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("her music a temporary escape," "knowing her journey had just begun") rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is established with consistent traits—respectfully rebellious mailman who smuggles hope across a divided territory—but his interiority remains thin, told more than embodied. The woman across from him is a cipher; her trembling hands and whispered line about her daughter are the only characterization, making the relationship purely functional. The motivation to reunite families is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses or visible cost in this scene. Minor penalty for label-heavy interiority ("respectfully rebellious") and stock embodiment (trembling hands, beating heart) that doesn't reach character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    The carpenter's twenty-year silence and decision to sing is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The motivation to "interpret silence as possibility" remains abstract—told as backstory rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and return to work gesture toward change, but the interior journey from fear to song lacks embodied contradiction or visible cost that would make the shift credible. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("fear warred with desire") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Margaret's interior is presented through abstract poeticism rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her "mission" and methods are asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal genuine stakes or flaws. The interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("sanely eccentric," "analog memories") and stock gestures (traced invisible patterns, whispered verses) without demonstrating what she risks or loses if she fails. No meaningful change or credible endurance forecloses a path with visible cost—she completes her work and returns to her desk, satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early, but her interiority relies heavily on summary and label-only emotions ("trembling hands," "tears blurred her vision") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final realization—that her sister transformed into light—arrives as delivered insight rather than through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Internal conflict is told in past-tense reflection rather than acted out in present decisions, and the therapy-adjacent phrasing ("luminous absence," "cipher of longing") substitutes for character-specific perception. The ending grants resolution without visible cost; Elara's stance shifts but no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The locksmith's motivation—liberating human potential—is told rather than shown through embodied stakes. His work is abstracted into mental-space metaphors ("mental chamber," "wrapped in layers of doubt") that remove physical constraint and reduce urgency. The woman whose mind he enters remains an object of his intervention, not a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Label-speak ("fear has bound them with chains of expectation") and therapy-adjacent abstractions ("the exquisite agony of a thought struggling to be born") flatten what should be a visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her decades-long quest feels earned, but interiority leans heavily on summary ("chronically curious nature led her") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The memory-recovery sequence moves too smoothly—each mushroom touch yields one tidy memory without confusion or false starts that would reflect genuine psychological disorientation. The final standing-whole moment reads as a completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; we don't see what she gives up or how the restoration alters her present stance beyond satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation to mentor is signaled early but his interior life remains under-developed; we observe teaching choices without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Prisha's embodied nervousness (trembling, spilling leaves) provides concrete texture, yet her arc from nervous to steady feels telescoped rather than earned through accumulated micro-choices. The "combative tenderness" label appears as authorial declaration rather than embodied tension in specific gestures. Backstory about the exile is mentioned but doesn't tilt a present choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The pruner remains an abstract vessel for mystical operations rather than a person under pressure. Her "insatiably creative" trait and motivation "to preserve the color of wonder" are label-only declarations; no on-page micro-choice tests competing impulses or reveals cost. The grandmother's wisdom and the pruner's "decades mastering the method" are told summaries that flatten urgency. Agency reads as ceremonial performance—pressing the seed, feeling energy, weaving light—without dramatized friction, doubt, or tradeoff that would earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's motivation to ground spirits is clear, and her trembling hands are well-embodied. However, her internal contradiction remains abstract—"broken in ways no craft could mend" is label-only and never dramatizes competing impulses in scene. The attribute of accumulating silence is intriguing but functions more as a metaphor than a trait that constrains her choices under pressure. Jacob's final secret reveal feels unmotivated because we never see him struggle with whether to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's "perceptive" and "methodically curious" traits are asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure.

Interior voice relies on diagnostic abstraction ("profound sense of shielded openness") instead of concrete, character-particular perception. The empathy motivation is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a hard trade-off or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal world is built through concrete observations ("quietly analytic," noting details of the snow globe), but her emotional arc rushes from professional distance to tears without intermediate contradictory impulses. The climactic epiphany ("It wasn't an island—Amelia wasn't describing a location") feels declared rather than earned through a costly choice. The "first name basis with death" trait is invoked but never constrains an on-page decision. Internal voice skews toward therapy-speak at peak beats ("the physics of letting go," "understanding physical forces as much as emotional ones").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation (empathy from childhood silence) is told rather than shown through present choices under pressure. The ghost remains abstract throughout, never forcing Elara into contradictory impulses or meaningful trade-offs. The flower press bolt plate appears as a convenient solution rather than emerging from character need. No visible cost or foreclosed path at closure; the "harmony" ending feels declared rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elira's warmly inquisitive nature is asserted but rarely constrains a choice with visible cost; her actions during the ascent are primarily observational and reflective. The captain exists only in backstory and memory, so no relationship crucible or status dynamics appear on the page. Interiority often resorts to summary ("Her warmly inquisitive nature had served her well") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("seek out the joy beneath anguish") rather than embodied contradiction. The final understanding feels declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure.

No meaningful choice is forced on the page; she simply continues her observations without sacrifice or internal friction. The ending's "understanding" arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than a decision forged by competing wants.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)

The ending shift from literal stars to "constellations of human connection" reads as epiphany rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eli's motivation is stated clearly but remains abstract throughout—his "diligent curiosity" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The discovery sequence unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or cost; he simply observes, notes, and succeeds. The interiority relies heavily on summary ("His meticulously curious nature prevented him from giving up") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. No visible path is foreclosed by the ending; the discovery arrives without requiring him to sacrifice or endure anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains abstract throughout, pursuing "the rhythm of repair" without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses.

Aris is labeled "strangely trustworthy" yet her interiority is entirely absent—she functions as a conduit, not a character with contradictory impulses. The community exists as a collective abstraction; no individual voices, embodied emotion, or micro-choices emerge. The story summarizes outcomes ("descendants still thanked," "triumph") rather than dramatizing pressure that would earn those states.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is declared ("whisper a lullaby…burn cold and constant") but his interiority remains abstract and untested; we never see contradictory impulses or a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The emotional register flatlines into "beautifully flawed…bruised awe" therapy-speak that asserts state rather than embodying degradation under stress. The final act—pressing the puppet head to the spindle—proceeds without friction or internal cost; he steps back "exhausted but resolute," a summary that replaces dramatized stakes. Embodied emotion and earned change are missing; the protagonist executes a ritual without meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and his caretaker burden is established early, but his interior life remains largely summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "offhandedly exact" trait is labeled repeatedly without embodying genuine internal conflict—he moves through the rescue mechanically rather than wrestling with competing desires. His decision to act lacks visible cost; the orchard curse's burden lifts too easily in the final paragraphs without foreclosing a meaningful path. The shift from "heavy heart" to peace reads as declarative summary rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is established (career vs. family grief) and the phone call represents agency, but the arc relies heavily on therapy-speak ("translate the separation...into connection") and the chrysalis metaphor doing conceptual work rather than embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is told more than shown in simultaneous action; the polymer-chemist lens remains ornamental rather than driving micro-choices under pressure. The sister's quick acceptance and the tidy parallel between molecular bonds and relationships flatten genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)

The stated motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") never faces dramatized friction or cost; the final "understanding" arrives as pure epiphany without prior struggle. Interior life consists of declarative statements rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The "clean slate" customer at the end exists only to illustrate resolution, not to create relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    Kael's gift is established but his interior life reads generic: "blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling" are stock phrases without embodied contradiction. The motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. His final emergence with "hands trembling but heart lighter" reads as label-only emotion without causal cost on the page—we never see what he forfeited or how the work altered him beyond summary.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)

The story tells us she is "empathetically decisive" and wants to build bridges, but we never see her struggle with a genuine dilemma or pay a visible cost for her choices.

The final success arrives without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths—she completes every puzzle smoothly—leaving no visible cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her actions remain observational rather than choosing under meaningful pressure. The emotional embodiment during the crack-strumming beat ("tears traced paths down her cheeks") offers some specificity, but no internal contradiction or competing impulse challenges her path. The story delivers interiority through concrete imagery (ember, morning ritual), yet the protagonist never faces a foreclosing cost or renunciation that would elevate the characterization into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's internal state is visible through the worry stone handling and his shift from arrogance to understanding, but the arc relies heavily on told epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The final "lesson he had never been able to teach" reads as diagnostic summary rather than dramatized realization under pressure. Motivation remains abstract—"discover beauty in the difficult"—without micro-choices that test competing goods.

Interiority relies heavily on stock metaphor ("anger is sharp, disruptive") and therapy-speak ("empathy is the bridge") that flattens character particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)

The final stance—"he understood how to weave between worlds not for power or prestige, but for healing and understanding"—reads as therapeutic insight delivered wholesale, not earned through on-page struggle. No secondary character applies immediate pressure; the journey remains purely internal and reflective without genuine resistance.

    Elara's interior life is dominated by abstract, poetic narration ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations are told via grandmother's deathbed instructions, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The journey's sacrifices (memories, sensations) are summarized rather than shown as embodied costs that force difficult trade-offs.

The ending's "determination burned brighter" is stock emotional assertion unsupported by prior micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias's reticence is labeled rather than dramatized through meaningful silence under pressure. His interior journey from isolation to connection is mapped, but the final choice (adding his stone, writing his letter) arrives as ceremonial confirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's core motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "accidentally prophetic" laughter is introduced but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost—she worries about it abstractly but takes no action shaped by that concern.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    Eleanor's compassionate-recluse nature is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

Malachi and the lieutenant are functional props rather than pressure sources, and the watch fob's mechanism is asserted rather than embodied through her attention or micro-choices under stress. The ending delivers tactical success without visible forfeit or deepening—Eliza simply leaves with her prize, unscathed.

The final "acceptance" arrives through summary declaration rather than dramatized struggle with visible cost. Supporting cast (the storm man) exists solely to deliver exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The artist's motivation is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Rhodes's interior life consists of summary statements about his gift and past criticism rather than embodied thought under present pressure. The choice to return to the portrait feels pre-determined rather than earned through on-page conflict; no micro-choices foreclose alternatives or reveal a hierarchy of values. Cora exists only as a label and a plot device, never pressuring Rhodes in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her wilting-near-dishonesty attribute is present, but it functions primarily as backstory color rather than an on-page constraint that forces choices. The final packing scene offers a stance crystallization ("no deception, no shortcuts") but lacks embodied contradiction or genuine struggle—she simply decides to be truthful going forward. Interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("candor in small moments might be the only thing strong enough") without character-particular texture or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The love-betrayal backstory is told rather than shown pressing against present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a passive conduit for celestial gift and community transformation rather than a protagonist who faces genuine internal contradiction. The seasonal muteness is labeled as "gift of heightened perception" but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; it functions as backdrop flavor. The final moment—"she climbed to the highest point... and gazed upon the world below"—offers no earned alteration, only serene witnessing. Motivation is declared ("preserve the color of wonder") yet never tested against a competing need or fear that would force a trade-off with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    Unit 734's internal conflict between mechanical nature and "strangely organic responses" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation choice arrives without visible struggle—the android executes protocol 34 smoothly, no cost shown in the decision moment itself. Embodied emotion is largely absent; labels like "nostalgia" and "inner static" replace concrete perception under pressure. The miniature selves appear as solution rather than through a micro-choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    Leo remains more curator than character; his "discerning" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Motivation arrives late ("decided to prove that listening heals") and lacks embodied cost—he never sacrifices comfort, time, or safety. The community members are sketched in label-only strokes (Mrs. Garcia arranging flowers, Marcus skateboarding) without distinct interior friction. The final "smile" is a stock closure gesture that asserts satisfaction without dramatizing what Leo relinquished to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is introduced with professional competence ("lyrical code breaker") but lacks embodied contradiction or flaws that create genuine internal conflict. Her motivation—"to encrypt vulnerability as strength"—is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The character moves through the plot without visible struggle or credible mistakes; her "calm defiance" reads as a label rather than a lived tension. Key beats (the dance sequence, the final revelation) happen to her rather than forcing difficult trade-offs that foreclose paths with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's motivation to find her brother's deleted memories is clear, but her interior life remains generic and label-driven ("her heart lighter than it had been in years"). The coffee-ground divination and crystal discovery feel more like plot conveniences than earned character choices driven by contradictory impulses. Her arc from grief to comfort lacks embodied struggle; the final "smile" and lightness arrive without visible cost or renunciation. The brother exists only as backstory furniture, never pressuring present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The solitary summoner remains abstract—a generic ritual performer without distinct flaws, contradictory impulses, or embodied stakes. Motivation is declared ("to hush a prophecy") but never dramatized through choice or cost; the crane and origami wing function as ornamental props rather than objects that reveal character under pressure. Internal experience is rendered through stock mystical language ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") that substitutes elevated diction for particular perception. No micro-choice forecloses a path; the summoner completes the ritual without visible trade-off or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Clara's motivation to understand building language is declared but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mr. Abernathy unfolds through summary ("weekly ritual," "following week") rather than embodied moments that test commitment. The genealogical reveal arrives through exposition ("They were distant relatives") without prior interiority or contradiction to earn the shift. "Mysterious familiarity" is asserted twice but never shown through specific perception or misrecognition.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is labeled "charmed skeptic" and "tragically radiant" but these traits function as ornamental descriptors rather than drivers of contradictory impulses in scene. Her father's disappearance is mentioned once without creating visible behavioral tension. The kneeling-and-arranging sequence lacks embodied hesitation or micro-choices that would reveal competing desires. The ending claims transformation ("no longer tragically radiant but illuminated with purpose") through assertion rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's interior is dominated by abstract guilt and label-heavy reflection ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to confess arrives without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting in scene; the text summarizes his motivation ("needed to forgive the unfinished business") instead of dramatizing torn loyalties. The blood-signature moment gestures toward cost, but the protagonist never wrestles on the page with fear of consequence or doubt. Therapy-speak interiority ("unlink himself from the consequences," "path to redemption") replaces scene-driven interiority at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The echo singer's motivations shift from learning why people echo to helping the child spirit, a move declared but not earned through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Interior states rely on poetic labels ("reed-blown melancholy") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The child spirit's agency is summarized ("made its decision") instead of dramatized, undercutting the closure's emotional cost. "Richly perceptive" appears as a stock trait without constraining or enabling specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation "to salvage something pure" remains abstract throughout; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion shapes her choices under pressure. The captain's spirit and descendants appear as plot functions rather than individuals with distinct wants. Key moments—visiting descendants in dreams, their confessions—are summarized rather than dramatized, so no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final exchange with the captain's ghost delivers therapeutic closure without the protagonist foreclosing any live option or paying a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates a consistent perceptual signature—seeing patterns in nets, birds, stars—and his interiority is specific to his occupation and philosophy. However, the character remains static throughout; he performs the same ritual journey without meaningful internal conflict or choice under pressure. The philosophy is told rather than tested, and no on-page decision forecloses a path with visible cost. The final smile merely confirms his existing worldview rather than earning transformation through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's interiority is told through label-only statements ("sharply observant," "determination unwavering") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her decision to touch the diamond and become a keeper arrives without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a prior path. The piece summarizes her emotional states ("felt hope") instead of dramatizing them through specific perception and micro-choices under pressure. No genuine flaw complicates her choices; she progresses through discovery to resolution without meaningful struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a static observer throughout; no on-page micro-choices under pressure drive causality. His "motivation burned constant" but never faces dramatized contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The story tells us he is visionary and patient, yet we see no embodied struggle, only retrospective summary of years already spent. The final smile is asserted satisfaction, not earned renunciation or alteration with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The poet's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority relies heavily on label-only feelings ("positively wistful," "trembled slightly with anticipation") rather than embodied contradiction. His final choice to share the music feels predetermined rather than forged under genuine pressure—no competing impulse or visible cost appears on the page. The character observes and enacts a gentle mission but never wrestles with a decision that forecloses a meaningful alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias is labeled "logically emotional" but never demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he moves through the sequence with textbook competence and no genuine struggle. His engineering knowledge and family duty align perfectly; there's no choice where competence fails or values conflict. The intruders are introduced as threat but vanish via convenient off-page resolution (screaming, then gone), removing any test of his renunciation or endurance. Motivation remains declarative rather than embodied through micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mapper's interiority is abstract and label-driven ("softly purposeful," "restrained wildness") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. No meaningful choice appears on the page; the protagonist observes, theorizes, and imagines outcomes without facing a dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending delivers satisfaction ("the mapper felt satisfaction") through summary rather than a dramatized renunciation or alteration. Motivation remains declared—"unyoke the people from their burden of constant haste"—but never tested by an on-page obstacle or internal conflict that would reveal hierarchies of value.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's professional interiority is established but remains surface-level—her "watchfully calm demeanor" and "fortified vulnerability" are told labels rather than embodied contradictions. The connection between the lantern and her personal rebellion against her supervisor feels abrupt and insufficiently grounded in prior causality; the grandmother's stories and "small family museum" arrive as exposition without altering present choices until the final decision. The closing choice to submit findings gains some weight from career jeopardy, but the controlling supervisor remains abstract, never pressuring her on the page, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Father Michael's motivation is clear and his journey to the shop grounds the present action, but interiority is largely summary ("the weight of his decision") rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. The reveal of Thomas Grant's backstory and the priest's decision arrive via extended explanation rather than embodied friction. Ms. Eleanor remains functional but one-note, and the final choice—to leave the heart broken—feels more thematically announced than dramatically earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    The glider's "yearning algorithm" and "steadily curious nature" function as label-only traits with no embodied contradiction or texture. Interior life is asserted through abstract computational metaphors ("algorithm recalibrated," "processors contemplated") rather than specific choices under pressure. The bell-ringing moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; the glider simply reaches a milestone and immediately seeks the next goal, producing a frictionless arc. No genuine internal conflict emerges—curiosity and yearning align throughout without competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains a cipher defined by her role rather than contradictory impulses. Her motivation is declared ("she needed to find") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final paragraph's "ready to uncover" lacks the embodied struggle or renunciation that would earn the closure. Interior voice relies heavily on stock thriller phrasing ("whispers from another dimension," "digital necropolis") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elena's motivation ("map empathy onto action") reads as a theme claim rather than embodied want under pressure. Her shadow-peacekeeper abilities function as convenient tools with no visible cost or tradeoff: the crystal simply reconstitutes when she focuses, with no genuine struggle or failure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from challenge to success without any competing impulse or blind spot. The "weighted breath before reply" device appears three times as a stock phrase without dramatizing what specific doubt or fear she must overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated but never dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from death-seeker to life-affirmer occurs through summary ("she understood") rather than embodied contradiction or decision with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gripped reality loosely," "fold in patience") without character-particular texture. The parasol tip is handled repeatedly but never constrains a choice or reveals hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sentinel remains an observing figure throughout with minimal embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing ("intersubjective understanding," "destined mismatches") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The burned letter edge is handled repeatedly but never drives a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost—it remains a prop for reflection rather than a crucible. The final "realignment of perspective" is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the passive stance (watching, reflecting, drawing parallels) never crystallizes into agency that alters his situation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The line walker remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic mystical declarations ("eyes that saw between worlds") without character-particular texture. The final "task complete" moment arrives without any visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path. No internal conflict dramatized; the protagonist glides through ritual without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara is labeled "perceptively calm" and performs ritualistic actions, but her interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The group members are introduced late and remain undifferentiated; their "mixture of hope and hesitation" is told, not shown through contradictory impulses. No meaningful internal conflict appears—Elara never doubts her method or faces a cost that forecloses a path. The "earnest whimsy" and archive backstory are asserted without micro-choices that reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scholar's motivation to decode linguistic patterns is clear and consistent, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The character remains static—his "weathered innocence" is asserted repeatedly without dramatized tension between competing impulses. Key moments like "I will preserve you" feel performed rather than arising from genuine pressure, and the final realization ("not preservation but translation") arrives as an epiphany without prior micro-choices that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prophet's "precognitively forgetful" gift is stated but never genuinely constrains a choice or creates an on-page trade-off; it remains label-only. The interaction with the caretaker briefly externalizes his motivation, but her sudden vanishing undercuts any relational pressure or earned change. The closing image repeats the opening action (arranging driftwood) without a visible shift in stance or knowledge, reducing the sense of cost. Interiority relies on abstract poetic phrasing ("tidal longing," "echoes of a memory") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's internal world is present but relies heavily on abstract labels ("ache," "meditation," "understanding"). The shift from mechanical repairer to metaphysical savant feels unmotivated by prior interiority—her epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than struggle with contradictory impulses. The mentor teaching moment and her patient listening are asserted personality traits rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to restructure perception filters lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no capacity surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's serene presence is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("scent of hope," "pulsing stillness") and therapy-speak labels without concrete sensory grounding. Mr. Anders and his son receive more dimensional treatment through the vinyl fragment, but the protagonist remains a vehicle for thematic delivery rather than a mind in genuine conflict. The ending choice to continue playing is emotionally legible but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover where shadows go at noon") but her choices are driven by a mechanical ritual rather than internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The opening traces symbols with "quietly deliberate precision," yet this attribute remains label-only—no trade-off between deliberation and urgency materializes on the page. Interiority relies on stock fantasy phrasing ("determination and old magic," "lifelong question") that tells emotional state rather than anchoring it in contradictory impulses. The final "realization" arrives without prior misbelief or struggle that would make the shift credible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eleanor's motivation is articulated ("to turn mistakes into constellations") but her interiority relies on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure. The Arthur-figure's line "My bones need setting" + "vulnerability that seemed both ancient and shrewdly innocent in its calculated display" hints at contradiction but reads as authorial commentary rather than dramatized tension. The final choice to join hands feels obligatory rather than earned by prior micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Backstory weight (~30%) meets BRR expanded mode tests but flattens present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and backstory anchors her present constraint, but interiority remains abstract—"wistful and determined," "pearl of stillness"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The workshop sequences show skilled hands and practiced fingers, yet no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; her journey from wistful to joyful reads as emotional summary rather than dramatized struggle. The final acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a path. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is present but relies heavily on abstraction and therapeutic language ("healing," "reconciliation," "protected vulnerability") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to leave the pendant is set up through spiraling reflection, but the decision feels contemplative rather than forged under pressure. Micro-choices exist (tracing the pendant, walking deeper, placing it down) but they don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values with visible cost—the entire arc reads as a single meditative acceptance. The "watchful dreamer" label is used as identity rather than dramatized through observation driving a pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The novelist is a collection of abstract labels rather than a person making choices under pressure. Interior life consists entirely of reflection and philosophical summary ("he had come to understand," "discovered that his true motivation") with no embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "peace" arrives as declaration rather than earned through dramatized renunciation or cost. Motivation remains told throughout; no on-page micro-choice tests commitment or foreclos a path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to restore sacred practices is declared but not dramatized through internal conflict or cost. The "strange pull toward the vine" and immediate clarity of purpose lack contradiction or struggle. Her "feverish" work montage skips micro-choices under pressure, and the resolution arrives through a device that works perfectly without complication. The villagers' memories return without resistance, flattening what could have been a high-stakes confrontation with individual doubt or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    The alchemist remains an abstract figure throughout, defined by occupation and repeated physical gestures ("hands, stained with the residue of countless experiments") but lacking contradictory impulses or genuine stakes. Interiority is entirely absent; we observe only slow, deliberate movements without access to tension, doubt, or embodied emotion. The final transformation occurs without visible cost or trade-off—the alchemist simply completes the pattern and succeeds. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist functions as a vessel for atmospheric description rather than an agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interior life is largely decorative rather than contradictory; she observes patterns and applies locksmithing metaphors but faces no meaningful internal conflict. The "reflective mind" trait is asserted through narration rather than dramatized through choice. Her father's teaching and the historian's advice are delivered as wisdom blocks without friction or cost. The ending choice—successful repair—feels inevitable rather than earned by visible struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fractal weaver remains a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Interiority consists largely of abstract musings ("whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—smiling and walking toward the horizon—feels declarative rather than earned by prior internal conflict. The shift from curse to gift is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara's interiority is concrete and anchored in embodied detail—the weight of wood, the tactile memory of her husband's teaching. Her contradiction between "hauntingly practical" and grief-haunted operates throughout, and the carving choice embodies a genuine micro-decision that forecloses momentum toward forgetting. However, the final resolution feels predetermined rather than earned by escalating pressure; her stance never truly shifts because she began in rust-hued peace and remains there. The lack of a visible internal struggle or foreclosed alternative path limits the felt cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.2)
    Cyrus's motivations are declared rather than dramatized—his "desperate motivation" and decades-long quest are told in summary. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("profoundly chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions") without embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final negotiation with his ghost lacks concrete stakes or visible cost; the ghost simply accepts the wheel and merges, offering forgiveness without dramatized friction. Agency at closure reads passive: the carousel restarts and carries Cyrus toward "unforeseeable new beginnings" rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "stoic determination despite the wonder" and "stoic wonder" are label-only feelings that tell emotional state without embodied specificity. The discovery of the sextant and decision to restore power proceed without meaningful internal conflict or visible trade-offs. The final "smile slightly, her expression still composed but her eyes alight" exemplifies emotion performed rather than lived through action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's interiority relies on abstract phrases ("fractured memories," "profound connection") rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation from "defeated clock scribe" to "hopeful craftsman" is declared through summary rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost. The bear encounter and crystal interaction feel symbolic rather than dramatized pressure that forces contradictory impulses to act simultaneously. The pocket watch placement is the closest to agency, but it arrives late and the cost remains告示 rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation—to understand the architecture of lies—is stated clearly but her interiority remains abstract and diagnostic ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") rather than embodied. The grandfather backstory occupies substantial space without altering present choices on the page. Her micro-choices (stepping aboard, retrieving the journal) track logically but lack contradictory impulses or visible cost that would earn the final stance. The ending declares transformation ("ready to begin the work") without dramatizing a foreclosed path or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The seed collector remains largely static through observation rather than choice; his "infinitely patient nature" is asserted but never tested with visible cost. The fisherman shifts from reticent to generous without dramatized pressure—the reversal reads as a timer expiring rather than the protagonist earning trust through risk. Interior life is thin: the collector watches, sits, and accepts with reverence, but no contradictory impulse complicates his stance. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "thrill of understanding" is a label, not a felt experience that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The traveler's interiority is abstract and therapeutic ("geography of healing," "explained absences") rather than embodied. Internal conflict is stated as past wounds rather than acting simultaneously on the page. The turn toward writing his own obituary arrives but feels like conceptual resolution rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains largely reflective summary without contradictory impulses pressing in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elorian's motivation to reawaken beauty is clearly stated but remains abstract throughout; his "determination replacing despair" pivot at the end lacks the embodied contradiction or micro-choice that would make it earn the final stance. Interior moments lean on label-speak ("bitter sweetness," "heartbreaking and illuminating") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The prince paces, traces patterns, and assembles a device, but these actions lack the drag of genuine internal conflict—no competing impulse forces him to hesitate or pay a visible price in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Maya's motivation to "prove that scars can sing" is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her competence as a firefighter faces no meaningful internal conflict or blind spot that compounds; she executes her rescue flawlessly without struggle. The backstory about her father is told in long reflective blocks that don't anchor to present micro-choices that alter her stance. Interiority relies on abstract poetic phrasing ("unyielding compassion," "kelp-drift peace") rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elara's interiority is almost entirely abstract—"luminous skepticism," "realistically imaginative nature"—with no contradictory impulses shown in scene. Her choices (following breadcrumbs, whispering words) feel procedural rather than driven by internal conflict. The final act dissolves the box through inherited ritual words, not a difficult trade-off that reveals character hierarchy. Embodied emotion is absent; we get labels like "hope" and "certainty" but no physical sensation or hesitation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "otherworldly sentimentalist" remains an abstract label without particularized interiority, embodied emotion, or meaningful contradiction. Motivation is declared ("share light without using fire") but never tested against competing needs or costs that would force a genuine choice. The being drifts through its mission without struggle, making the final "success" feel unearned. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist operates as a cosmic tour guide rather than a character with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivations are signaled early (collective grief, family ritual, mentor guidance) but his interior remains abstract—"fiercely meditative focus" and "thundering calm" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final carving is an outcome stated rather than a choice forged under competing pressures; no on-page moment shows him sacrificing one value for another. Embodied emotion is thin: dust motes, rattling panes, and butterflies function as atmospheric tokens rather than perceptual filters tied to his grief. The spectral mentor is cited repeatedly but never constrains a present decision or generates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Alaric's motivation is clear—guilt over structural neglect and a desire to restore community trust—but his transformation feels predetermined rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The epiphany arrives through inscriptions rather than from genuine internal struggle; he simply reads wisdom rather than discovering it through resistant choice. The collective ending works mechanically but his individual arc lacks the messy ambivalence that would make the shift from solitary precision to communal interdependence feel costly. Embodied emotion is present in "Heat bled through his fingertips" and "His voice cracked," but these moments coexist with therapy-speak like "incremental absolution" that flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias's motivation is signaled clearly and his blithe nature contrasts purposefully with his macabre occupation. However, his internal life remains largely illustrative rather than contradictory under pressure—he sorts artifacts tenderly, smiles softly, and processes revelations with smooth comprehension. The final understanding ("sacrificial rather than romantic") arrives as intellectual discovery without visible embodied cost or a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The interiority reads competent but never forces him into genuine struggle or a values conflict that would raise the stakes of his nightly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elara remains more concept than character. Her specialty, her quill, her mentor, her past predictions are told in exposition; we never see her misbelieve, struggle with conflicting impulses, or make a micro-choice under pressure that reveals hierarchy of values. The final act—dipping the quill and writing—arrives without dramatized internal friction or visible cost that would make this choice difficult rather than procedural. Interiority is abstract ("visualizing the vast network of data points") rather than embodied and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The copyist's motivation is clear (wanting stories to flow freely), but her interior life remains abstract—she never faces a moment where her revolutionary work costs her something personal on the page. Her decision-making is told rather than dramatized; we're informed she's been broadcasting for years, but no micro-choice under present pressure reveals her hierarchy of values. The "thistled calm" trait is label-only, and her emotional state never degrades or complicates under the risk she supposedly faces. No meaningful internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's profession and actions are present, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven. Her emotional arc—"sorrow and determination," "the mirage of safety"—is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The final understanding about "no safety in completion" arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized struggle. Micro-choices (tracing the mask, powdering) lack visible cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    Milo's motivation to preserve artifacts is consistent but never confronts meaningful internal contradiction. His "rationally rebellious" stance is asserted through label-heavy phrases ("abrasive calm," "wannabe philosopher") rather than embodied through conflicted micro-choices under pressure. The discovery of the chronometer cog triggers summary-level "agonizing" but no on-page moment where competing impulses act simultaneously—he simply pockets it and continues cataloging. The final preservation choice feels inevitable from paragraph one, foreclosing dramatic cost or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Eleanor remains label-only across the entire text—her "expectantly resigned manner" is asserted but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice. The choir members are summarized in abstract groups ("different backgrounds, languages, and beliefs") rather than individuated with distinct voices or competing impulses. The final "transformation" into "hopeful determination" is told, not earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. No moment shows Eleanor choosing between incompatible goods or enduring a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias's gift is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. The "informally wise nature" reads as authorial label ("informally wise eyes crinkling") rather than emergent voice. Interior monologue relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("gift and a burden," "necessary cuts") without embodied contradiction or visible cost. The planting decision feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses.

    Elara's involuntary truthfulness operates primarily as a plot device rather than a lived constraint with embodied cost. Her "desire to preserve wonder in routine" is asserted multiple times but never tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she simply explains everything when asked. The maintenance supervisor's motivation arrives via exposition in the climax rather than accruing through prior micro-choices. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion under pressure are absent; characters speak their thematic roles rather than inhabiting flawed, particular selves.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    Aria's interior relies heavily on abstraction ("gift," "mystery," "quest") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that alter tactics under pressure. Her actions are systematic but lack friction or cost on the page—she collects, places, understands, then continues without a visible trade-off. The climactic "understanding" arrives as declarative insight rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Emotional states remain at a stable contemplative register throughout with no degradation or intensification that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.2)
    The statue's motivation is delivered through telepathic exposition rather than embodied choice under pressure. The diver remains a passive receiver throughout, making no contradictory decisions or visible trade-offs—curiosity leads smoothly to understanding without foreclosing any path. Interior states are labeled ("turbulent thoughts," "ancient satisfaction") rather than shown through micro-choices that alter present options. The ending grants wisdom without dramatized cost: the diver simply "nodded" with "new understanding settling."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias's "grim optimism" and "balancedly daring nature" are stated labels rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. The mathematical obsession reads as plot device; his internal life remains flat throughout the endless climb. The final choice to "make the bet he had missed before" arrives without visible cost or felt renunciation—he simply does what he always wanted, erasing the purgatory rather than paying for escape. Interiority consists largely of thesis statements ("If the staircase is infinite, then it must contain infinite possibilities") that lack character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    The painter remains an interior monologue device without embodied contradiction or genuine flaws that complicate her work. Her insomnia and research are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The motivation "to prove that strangers remember kindness across millennia" is asserted repeatedly but never tested by an on-page obstacle or cost that forces a trade-off. "Methodically hopeful" functions as a label without constraining a single decision.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    The guide's "historically oriented ache" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Khira's defiance shows stronger embodiment ("gnarled fingers," "fierce concentration"), but her motivation remains surface-level—the bread remembers because she says so, not through on-page struggle. The guide's interior lacks genuine conflict; his motivations align too neatly with his actions. No visible cost forecloses a path for either character.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.2)
    Esme's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "neatly inventive mind" and reverse-engineering skills are told as labels without showing the specific mental moves or mistakes that would reveal character under pressure. The final choice—twisting the yoyo—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; we're told she defied fate but not what she sacrificed or risked losing. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("bleak exhilaration," "pure wonder") instead of embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation remains abstract throughout—"photographic curse," "fear," and "resuscitation" are deployed as labels rather than embodied stakes that drive concrete micro-choices. The whispering advisor reveal (future self) arrives without causal groundwork; nothing in prior behavior or dialogue seeds the reversal. Interiority leans on therapy-speak ("unbosom your fear," "acknowledging weakness") and the final transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. The piece tells us the protagonist "learned" and "understood" but never dramatizes a moment where competing impulses force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prophet remains a static oracle throughout, observing and interpreting without facing contradictory impulses or making a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Her competence is absolute—storms divert on command, children learn her methods—leaving no room for struggle or genuine vulnerability. Interiority consists of declarative certainties ("obstacles could become instruments") rather than embodied tension. The final act of hanging the mallet and resting carries no felt sacrifice or alteration earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, but his internal life reads thin—mostly exposition about his quest rather than embodied contradiction. The turning point (accepting his role as guardian) arrives through discovered information rather than pressure-forged choice. Emotions are largely labeled ("dread," "trembling") without specific physical texture, and the final acceptance feels declared rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eleanor remains a functional placeholder—"emotionally rational" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied tension. Her discovery unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost; she methodically documents and collects with no foreclosed path. The attribute labels (scholarly objectivity, rational temperament) substitute for on-page contradiction, and the final "recapture" moment lacks the weight of a choice that alters her stance or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The surveyor's motivation is declared but never tested by genuine conflict on the page—he wants to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams," yet no choice forces him to weigh that desire against cost. Interior life defaults to poetic abstraction ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The metal-box discovery offers a potential turn, but his reaction is curiously frictionless; he simply adds another note without visible stakes or renunciation. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost emerges by the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elias remains a placeholder: "logical page indexer" and "tranquilly perceptive" are repeated labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The discovery of his family sigil triggers contemplation rather than difficult trade-offs. The final shift from "indexer" to "bridge between past and present" is declared, not earned through on-page forfeiture or visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The lantern maker's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His grief and craftsmanship are label-heavy ("luminous torment," "crafty") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The shadow-detachment arrives as backstory without on-page cost, and the protagonist moves through the final sequence without visible internal conflict or resistance. No meaningful change is earned; he simply completes a ritual he planned from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is motivated by grief and purpose, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("bleak exhilaration," "intangibly tangible") rather than embodied contradictions. The backstory (drone strike wedding) anchors his mission but remains declarative; no micro-choices dramatize the tension between his survivor guilt and his harvesting project. His final smile feels unearned—there's no visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path, only optimism about future hunts.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya's motivation remains abstract throughout—"decode the frequency of belonging" never translates into a visceral, embodied want with competing costs. The "perpetually surprised" trait appears as pure label without constraining a single choice or creating tradeoff. Interior life consists of stock phrases ("sharp-eyed focus," "racing heart") and the final epiphany that she "was both the seeker and the missing piece" arrives as unearned therapy-speak rather than dramatized realization. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; she moves smoothly through the sequence without genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Martin's guilt and professional compromise are established early, and his internal conflict between deception and truth drives the arc. However, key interiority relies on abstract formulations ("weight of unspoken words," "hollow inside") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic realization—that his grandfather's love was unconditional—arrives through discovered object rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The final decision to close his business feels declared rather than enacted with visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra's trait of being "uncommonly thoughtful" is label-only and never constrains a choice with visible cost. Her interior voice relies on therapy-speak ("emotional dimensions," "untether...from resentments") and declarative self-awareness ("her personal mantra") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic exchange—handing over the drawer pull and the apology/forgiveness sequence—feels unmotivated because no prior on-page struggle or micro-choice builds toward Rennett's willingness to apologize or Lyra's authority to forgive. Interiority reads as exposition of her philosophy rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and stock phrasing ("heavy cloak of her regrets," "diminished echo"). The final shift to "student of the sea again" is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion appears occasionally (compass weight against hip) but pivotal moments default to summary ("something shifted inside her") instead of showing micro-choices under pressure. The backstory exceeds allowance without anchoring adequately in present micro-decisions that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy" is declared but never tested through on-page choices that reveal internal conflict or cost. The time-loop revelation arrives as explanation rather than dramatized contradiction—"You finally made it," he said—bypassing embodied struggle. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "jaded wonder washed over me," "haunted by the ghosts of actions I couldn't remember." The younger-self encounter offers no genuine friction; the protagonist accepts the loop instantly without visible emotional price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Eliora's motivation (reforge bond with dead brother) is clear and drives the conjuring scene, but her interior life relies heavily on stock phrasing: "tremor in her heart," "transforming herself with each motion," and "heart full of understanding." The metamorphosis is described through label-only changes ("eyes changed first, becoming pools of night sky") without embodied sensation or cost that would make the transformation feel like a genuine struggle. The brother's specter delivers on-the-nose dialogue ("love transcends form") that feels more like thematic summary than lived exchange, and the final return to "herself again" undercuts any lasting consequence of her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cartomancer's interior state is heavily labeled rather than embodied—"willingly perplexed," "choking beauty" appear as assertions without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The central realization about lost time is delivered via summary ("she realized") rather than through a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final vow to "meet each moment fully" reads as therapeutic self-awareness without the messy irrationality or visible trade-off that would earn the shift. Motives remain abstract throughout; no on-page micro-choice tests competing goods or forces a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.2)
    Eli's motivation to bridge dimensions is established, but interiority is abstract and label-heavy ("profound longing," "ghostly resolve") rather than contradictory or embodied. The choice to cross at the end feels inevitable from the setup rather than earned through on-page struggle or competing impulses. Shadow work and the gravitational lightness trait are mentioned but never constrain a micro-choice or create visible friction. The final crossing lacks a felt cost—joy replaces all prior isolation without dramatized ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ian's motivation remains abstract throughout—"understanding transformation" never translates into concrete, contradictory impulses that force difficult choices. His decision to release the lightning bugs feels unearned, arriving as a gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. The village girl appears too late to create relational pressure, serving as a prop for Ian's realization rather than a force that tests his commitment. Interior language drifts into therapy-speak ("catalyst for transformation," "authentic being") that flattens what should be embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elias is characterized primarily through role ("vigilant lock sentinel," "keeper of keys and secrets") and occupation-level detail rather than embodied contradiction. His "calm inventiveness" functions as a label without visible tradeoffs—he performs artist-deception and authority with equal smoothness, never struggling or miscalculating. The secondary guard and Keeper are functional props who apply no genuine pressure; their "nervousness" or "winking hush" are told rather than shown through distinct speech or choices. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is declared but never internally contradicted or complicated by on-page micro-choices under pressure. Her "precognitive curse" functions as a label rather than a dramatized constraint that forces trade-offs. The final transformation—visions no longer tormenting her—arrives through mystical absorption rather than earned struggle, and the emotional progression from torment to peace lacks intermediate embodied cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("trembling fingers," "in awe") without character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains a passive vessel for abstraction rather than a character making difficult choices. Interiority consists almost entirely of elevated poetic pronouncements ("furiously tranquil expression," "cartography of scars") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final "realization" about truth and lightning arrives as assertion rather than through dramatized struggle. Maia's revolutionary stance is told through labels (government-mandated silence, revolutionary thoughts) but never tested by an on-page dilemma that forces her to weigh competing costs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The mechanical arm is described but functions primarily as an ornamental marker of identity rather than forcing choices under pressure. Aris's interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("dignified chaos," "turn questions into destinations") repeated without internal contradiction or embodied cost. The student interaction offers a moment of potential complexity but dissolves into exposition; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The protagonist's competence is asserted through labels ("dueling philosopher," "intellectual rigor") without dramatized struggle or earned mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.2)
    The poet remains abstract throughout—his personality molts are told but never dramatized with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior life consists of poetic declarations ("to forge beauty from anarchy") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The Elias relationship is summarized in reflective blocks without on-page friction, and the protagonist's final action (scattering seeds, sealing the tin) carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pianist's motivation is clear—grief for his daughter—but his interior life remains abstract and label-driven ("wistful," "steely longing") rather than embodied. The decision to descend into the archive feels pre-ordained rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His plan unfolds without visible struggle or trade-off; he memorizes paths, modifies projectors, and executes flawlessly, foreclosing genuine uncertainty. The daughter exists only as backstory exposition, never charging a present choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's interior trait—"empirically whimsical"—is stated but never dramatizes a contradictory choice under pressure. The peak moment (placing the seed and singing) proceeds smoothly without visible internal conflict or a felt cost that forecloses a path. Doubt is mentioned ("doubt crept into her mind about whether she was truly worthy") but immediately resolved by ancestral voices, flattening the trajectory. The final "luminous doubt" phrase labels rather than embodies ambivalence through action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tutor's motivations (finding the color of unspoken apologies, reconciling with his dead brother) are present but primarily told through reflection rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life is dominated by slow-spoken monologue that remains consistent in register without degradation under pressure. The final whisper of his brother's name reads as a gesture toward closure but lacks visible cost—no on-page foreclosure of a path or embodied struggle that would earn the transformation from "cerulean regret" to "something like peace." Backstory exceeds 30% without sufficient interleaving of present micro-choices that alter tactics.

Micro-choices under pressure are present, such as following the seed's guidance, but emotional embodiment could be richer.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character's interiority is concrete and embodied, with tremors in hands showing emotion under pressure. Motivation to find the color of unspoken apologies drives key choices, and the final renunciation of regret is earned through prior causality. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as confession to the empty room, with visible cost in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is coherent, specific, and her shift from cosmic research to intimate observation feels motivated and earned by the flood and greenhouse damage. Her interiority is clear and character-appropriate, especially in how she revalues dust and decay. However, she faces little real resistance or internal contradiction on the page; her “kindled humility” arrives with minimal struggle. The arc is more declared than dramatized through difficult micro-choices, which keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena is clearly motivated (trauma, curiosity, sense of purpose) and her occupation and habits feel particular, but she rarely faces a concrete on-page dilemma where competing impulses collide. Her “steadily adaptive” trait is mostly told rather than dramatized through costly choices. Emotional states tilt toward summary and idealization (“luminous glass artist,” “newfound strength”) rather than embodied contradiction. The closing resolve is believable but comes without much visible inner struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena’s motivation and backstory are clear and consistent, and her artistic drive in response to deafness and a silent world is coherent. However, her interiority leans abstract (“hope,” “purpose,” “resilience”) with limited embodied, character-specific emotion. There is almost no on-page contradiction or moral tension; she moves from burden to fulfillment without serious inner friction. The final “newfound purpose” feels lightly earned because we never see her doubt, fail, or choose against a real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s core motivation—fear of his own finality and desire to “give rest a permanent address”—is clear and consistent, and his profession colors his choices. However, his internal conflict stays mostly summarized rather than dramatized; he rarely hesitates or pays an evident emotional price in-scene. The key decisions (following the coordinates, diving, restoring the lens, staying as keeper) all come fairly easily, with little contradictory impulse on the page. The final identity shift is conceptually earned but emotionally under-textured for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motives are clear, coherent, and his final public declaration follows naturally from his long-standing, anonymous giving, which gives the arc a grounded integrity. However, his interiority remains idealized and somewhat static—he never wavers, doubts, or shows a selfish impulse—so we miss the contradictory pressures that would deepen him beyond emblematic goodness. Mira and the teens function more as extensions of his mission than as pressures on him, so relationships don’t quite become crucibles. The lack of visible psychological cost at the decision point keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—seeking where “unused love” goes—but she is rendered in an idealized, nearly frictionless way with little internal contradiction or genuine flaw. Her emotionally pivotal beats (accepting Kwan Yin’s gift, becoming a healer) happen smoothly without much struggle or ambivalence on the page. Interiority is present but leans on abstract, spiritualized language rather than sharply particular, character-specific textures. The final change into a “keeper of light” is earned enough for this scope but lacks visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s core motivation (to probe the texture of time) is clear and consistent, and her professional identity as a maze designer gives her some specificity. However, her emotional life is thin: we glimpse fear and intoxication but not much contradiction, backstory depth, or personal stakes beyond abstract curiosity. The decision to “without hesitation” take up the fragment again and effectively risk annihilation feels more concept-driven than emotionally earned. Relationships are absent on the page, so her obsessions never meet a human crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (saving seeds to restore a drought-stricken world) is strong and consistent, and her competence reads clearly in her tactical steps. However, she experiences little on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she’s almost purely admirable. Emotional states are often summarized (“Her motivation burned bright”) rather than embodied in specific, character-particular perceptions. The final transformation—chained fugitive to roaming teacher—feels more declared than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kael’s obsession, professional brilliance, and isolation are clearly motivated and consistent, and his color-hearing plus cancer diagnosis give him specificity and vulnerability. However, his internal conflict is mostly stated rather than dramatized in pressured moments; we’re told his quest consumes him but rarely feel a live, in-scene struggle or contradictory impulse. The late epiphany about trust reforming lands, but it comes with minimal on-page cost or resistance. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly lived-in depth.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lillian’s motivation—to understand her strange affinity with light—feels specific and consistent, and her competence as a thief is well-drawn through concrete tactics (flower codes, reading the desk). However, her internal conflict between criminality and “historian” is mostly resolved in a single reflective beat, with little on-page struggle. The stationmaster is functional but flat, serving as a light obstacle rather than a true crucible relationship. The final shift in self-concept is appealing but arrives a bit too cleanly for this level of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is vivid and particular—his habit of narrating his own actions, his reverence for inquiry, and his grief marked by the cracked bookmark cohere into a strong, specific character. Motivation (to create safe spaces for inquiry and to thaw his own grief) is clear and consistent. However, his inner conflict is largely told rather than dramatized; we rarely see him tempted to retreat or fail, so contradictions feel muted. The change by the end is credible but somewhat pre-assured, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s core makeup—phobia-ridden stunt double, adaptive, newly disillusioned heiress—is clear and mostly coherent, and her panic vs. resolve under pressure reads credibly. However, much of her psychology is delivered in label form (“firmly adaptive,” “fundamental betrayal”) rather than dramatized in specific, character-particular behavior. The shift to “authentic Maya” at the end is motivated but overly tidy, with little real mess or moral ambiguity. Interiority feels generalized rather than distinctly hers, which blunts the emotional cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s motive—to create a map through the endless night rather than prevent it—is clear, particular, and earned by her lineage and obsession with silence. Her shift from “mildly obsessed” to “violently determined” gives her a credible internal arc, though it leans more declarative than dramatized through difficult, concrete choices. Emotion is mostly conceptual rather than bodily or behaviorally specific, which keeps her slightly abstract. There’s little real friction between competing impulses on the page, so the final stance costs her less visibly than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit 347’s core motivation—to understand the origin of its thoughts—is clear, consistent, and meaningfully tied to its choices about the violin. The tension between protocol (melting hazardous debris) and curiosity is well set up and carried through to the decision to surrender to the timelines. However, interiority leans on abstract labels (“existential processors,” “mystical moment of self-discovery”) rather than more specific, embodied robot experience. The final transformation is plausible but could carry more felt cost if its prior attachment to stability or service were dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s motivation—thawing mistrust through transparency—is clearly stated and consistent, and her curiosity and ethical lean are legible. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized rather than embodied, and the privacy vs. honesty tension never fully sharpens into felt internal conflict. The decision to leave the lens reads as principled but comes too easily, with little sense of temptation or cost. She feels more like a thematic function than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is specific and coherent: an aging, quietly stubborn gardener whose rituals and beliefs are tightly tied to his body and work. His motivation—to demonstrate a non-quantifiable bond with the garden—is clear and consistent, and his withered physicality credibly mirrors the garden’s cycles. However, his internal conflict is muted: there’s little on-page struggle between his pragmatism and mysticism, and the emotional risk of the coming scientific visit is more stated than felt. The apprentice relationship is barely dramatized, so it doesn’t operate as a crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Aris is clear, competent, and driven, with a consistent blend of gentleness and scientific focus, but she faces almost no resistance that would expose contradiction or deeper psychology. “Icy warmth” and “mechanically warm” hint at a cyborg-like embodiment and emotional stance, yet these never create real tension in her choices. Her motivation is consistent but unlayered: she wants to prove a theory and then does. The final “awakening of purpose” feels thematically apt but almost costless, so the internal shift is modestly earned rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s artistic pull and kinship with the ghost are clear and consistent, and his choice to play the score grows credibly from those motives. However, he experiences almost no contradictory impulses—no real fear, doubt, or temptation to walk away—so internal conflict is thin. Emotional states are often summarized in abstract terms (“暧昧 possibility,” “something profound beyond mortal understanding”) rather than embodied in specific reactions. The final “completion” of his task feels earned but relatively low-cost, more a fulfillment of desire than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is sharply etched as an ascetic, analytical mystic whose habits (the tucked illustration, methodical checks) align with his role and gifts. His motivation to uncover the “swallowed truth” grows plausibly from fever, vocation, and worldview. Interior conflict is more implied than dramatized—he rarely wavers or contradicts himself on the page, which flattens the emotional range slightly. Still, his particular way of noticing and thinking feels character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marcus is clearly sketched as a reckless, skeptical urban explorer with a specific obsession, and his inner lens on objects and ruins feels particular. However, his internal conflict is relatively soft: he shifts from curiosity to acceptance of a thematic insight without much visible resistance or cost. The "weight of swallowed truths" functions more as a declared motif than as a dramatized psychological knot he struggles against. The final lightness he feels reads a bit tidy and under-earned relative to the gravitas implied.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and the moment where their “loose grip on reality became an anchor” is a strong, character-specific beat. However, interior conflict around the tempting stasis of the silence is mostly asserted rather than dramatized in scene. We’re told they resist absorption more than we feel that resistance as a struggle. This keeps the character from fully crossing into the most memorable, high-stakes emotional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is convincingly drawn as a gentle, grief-informed therapist whose actions (planning the eclipse session, selecting instruments, reading Lila’s cues) follow clearly from her history and philosophy. Lila is thinner but appropriate to her muteness; her small reactions and final outburst feel credible. Emotional beats are mostly embodied rather than labeled, though phrases like “healing wasn’t linear” edge toward abstracted therapy-speak. The final embrace and spoken line are earned by the prior groundwork of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The historian’s core motive—collecting stories from walls before they fade—is clear and consistent, and their actions track with it. However, interiority is generalized rather than character-particular; “sensitively perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized as a conflicted inner life. There’s almost no visible internal contradiction or emotional cost to their choices, so the final sense of “purpose” feels more stated than earned. The character reads more as a symbolic custodian than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fortune writer has a clear, consistent motivation and history, but he’s rendered almost entirely through summary rather than dramatized choices under pressure. We’re told he was once frightened by his accidental prophecy, yet we never see a live internal conflict or contradiction play out on the page. His emotions remain abstract (mission, understanding, orchestration) rather than embodied. As a result, he feels like a neatly defined idea more than a fully inhabited person.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Father Michael’s vocation, history with the dimensional anchor, and experimental faith give him specificity and clear motivation, and his tactics emerge logically from that background. However, his interior conflict is muted: we’re told his methods are “heretical,” but we never feel a live moral struggle or cost on the page. Sarah functions almost entirely as a vessel for the entity, with minimal characterization of her own. The emotional progression is coherent but lacks the contradictions and embodied stress that would make his victory feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s longing and “chronological homesickness” are specific, and his methodical, almost ritualistic process with the shell gives him some individuality. His core motivation (to conduct his inner symphony) is clear and drives his morning’s choices. Internal conflict exists—desire versus mounting exhaustion—but it never sharpens into a truly contradictory, high-friction state. The final endurance/collapse feels earned, though the emotional cost could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s motivation (to understand his gravity-defiance) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and the childhood/backstory beats give the power some emotional weight. However, most of his turmoil is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so contradictory impulses under pressure are more told than felt. The final acceptance of his nature is thematically apt but comes with little on-page vacillation or resistance in the climactic chamber. This limits the sense of real cost or struggle in his internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s core motivation and history are clear, and her turn from despair to renewed purpose tracks logically. However, much of her interiority is summarized in abstract terms (“emotional numbness”) rather than dramatized through concrete, contradictory impulses in-scene. Her relationship with the drum maker and students is sketched rather than pressured, so we don’t see her values really tested. The final “rebirth” feels slightly too frictionless for the depth of loss implied.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is clearly motivated—meticulous, curious, committed to integrity—and his decision to use the pigeon system against the authorities is well grounded in those traits. However, his interiority leans toward declarative statements (“He would nurture integrity in solitude”) rather than lived, contradictory impulses under pressure. We rarely see genuine internal conflict between self-preservation and exposure. The arc from observer to active resister is credible but emotionally under-textured for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s grief, caution around scent, and role as a lantern broker form a coherent interior life, and his choice to finally confront the vial feels motivated by that history. However, his emotional experience is often summarized (“he finally understood…”) rather than embodied through idiosyncratic perception or contradictory impulses in the moment. We get little sense of irrationality or self-sabotage under pressure—his journey feels smooth and thematic rather than messy and particular. The final acceptance reads credible but a bit too tidy for the depth of loss implied.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The poet’s motivation—to understand the altered texture of time—is clear and consistent, and their behavior with the rope aligns with that drive. However, interior conflict is quite muted: they glide from curiosity to insight without much real friction or contradiction beyond a vague “impossible choice” that never forces them to act. Emotions are often summarized in elevated language (“ethically playful smile,” “passionate subtlety”) instead of being deeply embodied. The final realization feels gently earned but low-cost, more contemplative than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to hear and translate the world’s residual vibrations and “find beauty in the unfinished”—is clear and consistent, and his final realization about the hush feels earned by prior habits. However, his interiority remains generalized and mostly stated rather than embodied; we’re told his values via his grandmother and father more than we feel contradictions or sharp emotional texture. The family members function more as thematic voices than as pressure sources, so relationships don’t really act as a crucible. The change at the end is credible but low-cost, with little evidence of internal conflict or sacrifice along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s vocation, philosophy, and basic decency are clearly rendered, and his methods feel profession-specific. However, his interiority is largely declarative rather than dramatized under pressure, and we rarely see contradictory impulses clash in-scene. His care for clients vs. his role as “counterfeit” dealer is stated but not forced into a hard choice. The ending stance (affectionate detachment with fulfillment) feels plausible yet lightly earned because no beat truly tests or threatens it.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias and Eleanor are clearly drawn, with consistent traits (shrewdness, attentiveness, quiet dedication) and plausible professional identities, and Elias’s desire to honor “silent contributors” motivates his choices. However, interior conflict is minimal: he encounters no real resistance, doubt, or cost beyond mild social tentativeness, so his “change” from transactional to genuinely connective feels largely declared rather than tested. Elias’s mentor functions more as a thematic device than a psychologically textured presence. The relationships develop warmly but without much pressure to expose deeper flaws or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s yearning for connection is clear, consistent, and drives her choices from the opening through the proposal of the shared search to the final dedication of the arbor. Secondary characters (Kael, Mira, Fen) are sketched in clean, suggestive strokes but remain somewhat archetypal, applying gentle pressure rather than true crucibles. Internal conflict is present but mild—the ache of isolation versus the hope of community—without a strongly dramatized moment where contradictory impulses clash. The closing choice to “found belonging” feels emotionally right but a bit tidy, with limited sense of an ongoing flaw or cost beyond past loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    The illustrator’s goal and core trait (meticulous observer willing to sacrifice his own future) are clear and consistent, and his final choice to spend his lifespan is well motivated. However, his interiority stays fairly generic—more stated intention than idiosyncratic thought—and there’s little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion is light (we’re told he’s exhausted, desperate, quickening his pace, etc., but with few specific, character-particular sensations). As a result he reads more as a well-drawn role than a fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core motivation (mathematizing emotion, finding her mentor) is clear, consistent, and plausibly tied to her habits and tools. We get some nice specificity in her “gently inventive” approach and her guarded hope. However, internal contradiction is under-dramatized: her fear of hope’s danger is told more than enacted under pressure. The ending stance—renewed purpose—is credible but arrives without a strongly tested, conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dweller’s motivation and history are clearly articulated and consistent, and their technical competence plus long attachment to the library feel grounded. However, internal contradiction is minimal: they want visibility yet the choice to remain hidden is presented as relatively untroubled, with little on-page ambivalence or struggle. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in embodied, pressure-driven moments. The final choice to intervene indirectly is plausible but not sharply costed in felt terms.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—control as a path to understanding—is clear, consistent, and credibly drives her actions from obsessive documentation to the climactic choice to “let go.” The internal shift from control to partnership is earned through accumulated observations, though it’s often summarized rather than embodied in specific, high-pressure moments. Her emotional life could use more concrete, idiosyncratic embodiment; much of her turmoil is inferred rather than felt in the body. Marco functions only as a light thematic nudge rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena is sharply sketched—insomniac, traumatized, obsessive about rain trails—and her decision to trade the brooch for pigments is motivated and aligned with her hunger to “thresh meaning from experience.” Internal conflict around letting go of the brooch is present but somewhat underplayed; the choice lands more as gentle inevitability than a genuinely fraught trade-off. The old woman has enough specificity (mother, buried brooch, salvaged pigments) to feel real rather than purely symbolic. Emotional embodiment leans more conceptual than visceral, but remains coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara has a clear role and baseline motivation (understanding the pearl, later embracing the new magic), but her inner life remains relatively smooth and unconflicted. The pivotal shift from anxious disorientation to welcoming unpredictability happens quickly, with little dramatized struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. The pilgrim is a functional catalyst but flat as a character, applying no sustained relational pressure. The final realization feels more like an idea landing than a hard-won personal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elina’s role, vocation, and broad motivation are clear and consistent, and the text gives her a distinct sensibility around fragments, absence, and return. However, we rarely see her make concrete micro-choices under pressure on the page; most of her “actions” are summarized (she “learned to hearten,” “kept detailed records”) rather than dramatized. Internal conflict is minimal; she doesn’t visibly struggle between competing impulses or pay a clear personal price for what she chooses to reveal. The returnees register as a generalized crowd, so relational dynamics never become a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ethan’s motivation and vocation are clear and specific, and his reaction to the ticket punch and fortress fits his “analytically artistic” profile. However, his interiority leans toward stated purpose (“He knew his purpose”) rather than dramatized conflicting impulses, so the “trembling” part of his certainty never quite manifests as live contradiction. There is little sense of genuine risk or flaw-driven error in his choices; he feels more like a destined vessel than a pressured human. The closing transformation is believable but low-cost, reading as clean elevation rather than a conflicted change.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s core traits (skeptical yet open, courageously kind, motivated by a desire to help others connect) are clear and consistently expressed through her choices with the tile and the tower. However, we rarely see real internal contradiction under pressure; her transition from private experimenter to public “keeper” unfolds smoothly without a felt struggle or visible cost. Emotions are often summarized (“felt strangely sympathetic,” “courageously kind decision”) rather than dramatized in embodied, idiosyncratic ways. The final stance feels earned in a general sense but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Alistair’s motives (boredom, grief for Elara, curiosity about “what happens after goodbye”) are clear and consistent, and his final reorientation toward guardianship reads as a genuine change. However, his interiority tends toward generalized abstraction rather than character-specific texture, and we rarely see contradictory impulses in live tension—he moves smoothly from boredom to intrigue to acceptance. The discovery that the amulet belonged to Elara is emotionally underexploited; it informs plot but doesn’t create a visible internal struggle. His acceptance of immortality as “not a curse” feels somewhat tidy and under-costed given the millennia of prior despair.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her calculus of “security for his life” and desire for redemption frame every action. Her competence and calm under pressure feel credible for someone in her profession and with her history. However, internal contradiction is underplayed; she rarely wavers or shows simultaneous fear and resolve in a fraught way, which flattens potential depth. Emotional experience leans on summary more than concrete, character-specific embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s devotion, isolation, and meticulousness are clear and consistent, and his motivation—to preserve the “textures of different times”—is well-grounded in both habit and lineage. However, he faces almost no contradictory impulses or genuine dilemma; the piece is more character portrait than character under pressure. The generational duty via the notepad adds dimension but not conflict. The ending endurance (continuing his work) costs him in an abstract way but isn’t dramatized as a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s liminal status and hunger for identity are clear and consistent, and the ongoing choice to “press on through the labyrinth, collecting stories” feels motivated. However, emotion stays mostly at an abstract, conceptual level; there’s little embodied feeling or contradiction under pressure. The internal conflict between reclaiming an old self and embracing the layered, constructed one is implied more than dramatized. The final stance—accepting being “something more than records can contain”—is earned but could land harder with more concrete, conflicted moments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Evelyn’s goal and professional stance as a “myth buster” are clear and consistent, and her curiosity reasonably drives her actions through the observatory. However, her interiority is fairly generalized and lacks sharp, character-specific contradiction or blind spots under pressure. The shift from skeptic to someone who accepts a paradoxical “truth” is thematically apt but emotionally under-dramatized. We don’t see much genuine struggle or cost in that change, just a smooth acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s motivations (protect tradition vs. enable survival) are clear and consistent, and their pattern-seeing mind drives the key discovery. However, much of their struggle is summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely feel embodied, moment-to-moment conflict under pressure. The dual allegiance is stated and revisited, but their internal tug-of-war doesn’t fully manifest in concrete, costly on-page choices. The final renunciation of the stone is earned conceptually but lands more as idea than as a hard-felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elena’s motive is clear and consistent—documenting the fireflies before mining destroys them—but her interiority leans on repeated labels (“purposefully curious,” “dawnlit melancholy”) rather than textured, contradictory impulses under pressure. She never genuinely wavers or faces a meaningful internal trade-off; competence is untested. Emotions are often summarized instead of embodied in specific sensations or irrationalities. The closing sense of purpose is believable but feels linear rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias is distinct and appealing—a blind, meticulous repair artisan with a clear emotional investment in his former apprentice—but his inner life under pressure is only lightly sketched. His competence is almost frictionless, so we rarely see contradiction or genuine struggle beyond a tossed-off line about “steadier hands.” Motivation (connection, guidance) is clear but mostly asserted rather than tested. The relationship with the apprentice is entirely off-page, limiting relational heat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elmsley is sharply sketched—his profession, dry wit, and obsession with “where the rivers begin” are convincingly integrated, and his competence feels grounded. However, he faces almost no meaningful internal conflict or ethical friction; his belief is vindicated without substantial self-doubt or cost. His emotional shifts are subtle but credible, particularly in the contrast between the outpost’s loneliness and the sacred site’s reverence. The final realization is earned, but it doesn’t force him to sacrifice anything or confront a serious flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is vividly sketched through role and ritual, but his interior life and contradictions are thin for this level; he is more emblem than fully inhabited person. His motivation (“shared balance”) is clear yet never truly strained or tested on the page. Emotional responses are mostly implied through description (his “rare and cryptic expression”) rather than embodied conflict. The endurance at the end feels competent rather than costly because we never see an alternative impulse or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s core drive—curiosity and reverence for knowledge versus her survival training—is clear and consistent, and her choice to risk death for the vial is motivated. Interiority has some specificity (memories of her mother teaching her to swim, first expedition), but emotional texture leans toward generalized awe rather than idiosyncratic thought. The internal conflict (“training screamed at her to retreat” vs. the vial’s pull) is present but resolved quickly with limited messiness or contradiction. Her final stance—valuing the temple and its secrets enough to plan a return—feels earned but not deeply interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    The son’s core motivation—escaping his father’s legacy and being believed—is clear and consistent, but it remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through specific, pressured choices. We get some micro-actions (pressing against the lattice, writing on walls, practicing truth in the mirror), yet none are truly tested on the page. The “before they find the bodies” detail hints at darker stakes but never concretely reshapes his behavior, leaving internal conflict underexploited. The final “redemption” feels more declared than earned by visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ghost bride’s core motivation and long-term endurance are clear and consistent, and her final act with the seeds is credibly rooted in that drive. However, interiority is mostly summarized (“exhaustion of souls”) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. Thomas is more an idea than a presence, so the relationship feels slightly abstract. The change at the end—releasing the seeds and accepting dissolution—lands but could carry more nuanced inner conflict in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s core motivation—to transform “ruin into reverence” through her art—is clear and consistent, and the sleepwalking device nicely externalizes her drive. However, her interiority stays generalized and idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or concrete fear (e.g., of defacing the sacred) pressing against that optimism. The sleepwalking also removes agency at key beats, so we don’t watch her make hard conscious choices. Her exhaustion and the villagers’ concern hint at cost but aren’t fully dramatized as a crucible for change.

    Kaelen’s longing for reconnection and his decision to help with the excavation are clear, coherent, and drive his actions through to the restored faith at the end. His emotional life is present but leans on generalized formulations (“the weight of exile lift”) rather than sharply individuated contradictions under pressure. Internal conflict is muted: he moves fairly smoothly from curiosity to devotion without a real on-page test of his resolve or a costed alternative path. Elena functions more as a foil and expositor than as a genuine relational crucible.

    Elara is clearly and consistently motivated—her love of analog, her craft, and her dawning sense that she’s doing more than a “service” all cohere. The tactile relationship with the clipboard, chalk, and mail system gives her interiority specificity. The main limitation is the lack of on-page contradiction or real internal friction; the realization feels more like a smooth reframing than a pressured choice. Her final act (mailing the letter) is emotionally apt but carries only a lightly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (listening to the universe’s “unheard stories” and thwarting the coup) is clear and consistently expressed through her craft and strategic self-presentation. Her external foolishness vs. internal acuity is effective, especially in the official’s scene, but we rarely glimpse genuine doubt, fear, or moral friction under pressure. Emotional texture skews toward competence and calm rather than layered contradiction. Secondary characters are flatly utilitarian, serving mostly as foils without becoming real relational pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s desire—to recover the unwritten moment and understand why he left—is clear and consistent, and her actions (entering the labyrinth, using the shard, choosing forgiveness) align with it. However, her inner life leans on generalized phrasing (“the fierce tenderness of the revelation”) more than character-specific contradiction or flaw. We don’t see her wrestle with impulses to blame, cling, or turn back; acceptance comes smoothly once information appears. The emotional shift to compassion and forgiveness is credible but a little too tidy for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s characterization is specific and coherent: the war background, translator’s mindset, and attentiveness to objects as vessels of meaning all align convincingly with his present actions. His motivation—to help Lina reframe her loss—is clear and rooted in his history. However, he experiences little visible internal conflict or contradiction in the moment; he’s steady and competent rather than pressured into a difficult emotional choice. Lina, meanwhile, functions more as an emblem than a fully realized presence, which limits the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amelia’s motivation—to rediscover lost joy through her art—is clear and consistent, and her professional specificity (muralist, painting with light) gives her some individuality. However, she faces little meaningful resistance and exhibits almost no internal contradiction; once she finds the fragment, she simply executes her plan successfully. Emotional beats are often summarized (“Her heart quickened…”) rather than deeply embodied in idiosyncratic ways. The closing sense of purpose feels earned but relatively low-cost, limiting the impact of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s professional specificity and sensory way of thinking (calculating paint ratios while tracing the violinist’s face) give her a clear, credible interiority, and her curiosity toward the nickel tracks. However, her internal conflict is underdeveloped: her “certainty dissolving” happens with little friction or costed hesitation, making the final shift more graceful than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kaelen’s role and motivation are clear and consistent, and details like his rumpled jacket, charm, and manuscript collection sketch a specific personality, but interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized. We seldom see his contradictory impulses under live pressure; he feels like an emblematic dissident more than a fully inhabited person. The final “pure, untaxed thought” moment gestures toward an internal cost, but it isn’t grounded in prior on-page emotional struggle. Secondary characters, especially Beecher, function as useful roles rather than pressure-bearing relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The poet’s core drive—to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” so others can sleep—is clear and consistent, and their insomnia-as-sacrifice gives them dimension. However, interiority stays abstract and generalized, with little embodied emotion or specific, character-particular thought. We rarely see contradictory impulses in scene (e.g., resentment of their role versus devotion to it); their endurance feels assumed rather than tested. The final choice is more narrated fate than an earned, dramatized renunciation, which blunts the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleth’s role, values, and professional competence are clear, and their motivation to preserve forgotten feelings is consistently dramatized (especially in “foxglove regret”). However, internal contradiction and real dilemma are muted: they never seriously consider failure, abandonment, or transgression. The arc is more an affirmation of their existing identity than a pressured change, which limits depth. Embodied emotion is present but tends toward the generalized and symbolic rather than sharply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s motivation—to prevent permanent division by decoding old promises—is clear and consistent, and her profession is meaningfully embedded in her interiority. However, her inner life leans on repeated labels (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) more than dramatized contradictions under pressure. We don’t quite see a concrete, risky interpretive choice play out with visible cost; her “recklessness” remains mostly asserted. The lack of an on-page relational crucible (leaders and opponents are off-stage) limits how much her values are tested.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s vocation, family legacy, and desire to reconcile engineering and preservation are clear and consistent, and her competence is well dramatized through specific actions (adhesive analysis, reading the inscription, sketching the design). However, she is almost entirely virtuous and capable, with little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine moral hesitation on the page. Her anxiety is mentioned (“tremble”) but never truly complicates a choice or produces a mistake. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, more an affirmation of her preexisting values than a pressured transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and coherent—her history with pigeons, grief over their loss, and urge to reinvent herself all align cleanly with her choices. The tension between wanting to erase her past and being drawn back to it is credible, especially in the letter scene where she reclaims “Elara of the Flight Paths.” The emotional cost of reopening that life could be embodied more sharply rather than mostly implied. Still, for the length, her motivation and change are convincingly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s desire—to understand thresholds and find her father—is clear and consistent, and her skills (intuition, reading wood grain) are well integrated with that motive. However, her inner life stays relatively one-note (quiet, determined, receptive) with little contradictory impulse or visible cost under pressure. The reunion comes easily once the “right” doorway appears, so the emotional change feels more affirmed than earned. The father’s grief and regret are interesting but arrive very late and are mostly stated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s desire “to learn the rhythm of belonging” is clear and consistently drives her choices, from entering the facility to following the feather and staying until sunrise. We get a specific, curious, observant consciousness rather than a generic explorer. However, there’s little active internal contradiction or genuine struggle—she moves from wonder to understanding with minimal resistance or mistake. The final reorientation toward “belonging” is earned but emotionally low-cost, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The recollectionist has a clear, consistent motive (understanding vanished paths) and a distinct sensibility, but her interiority skews declarative and serene rather than conflicted. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or real cost around her discovery; the “burden” of her gift is told more than dramatized. Her pivotal choice—to plant the seed and trust the bird’s offering—lands, yet it comes with almost no hesitation or tension. This keeps the arc engaging but emotionally shallow for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo’s motivation and professional mindset are clear and specific—his desire to “orchestrate serendipity” fits his habits of observation and planning, and his competence feels credible. However, he faces no genuine internal conflict or moral friction; his success costs him nothing and reveals little new about him. The bureaucrat is sketched effectively in a few strokes but remains more function than person. The final beat reaffirms Leo rather than evolving him, which limits depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira’s core motivation (to preserve memory via her body and art) is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation of mobility for vision is thematically apt. However, most of her inner life is summarized rather than dramatized, with little in-the-moment hesitation or contradictory impulse around the anchoring choice. The months of trying to “fledge” are told in a block instead of being felt through specific earlier failures. As a result, her transformation reads more as the fulfillment of a stated plan than as a difficult, pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mara’s core motivation and temperament are clear, and her profession is convincingly tied to how she thinks and perceives. However, the internal arc leans on a fairly smooth, unpressured epiphany rather than conflicting impulses dramatized in scene; there’s little sense of what it costs her to change. Emotions are often named or generalized (“noctilucent reckonings,” “enormity of her realization”) rather than embodied in concrete, character-specific reactions. The final resolve feels plausible but somewhat pre-decided, more confirmation than hard-won shift.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The firefighter’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in embodied experience—the ache in his bones, the calloused yet gentle fingers give him texture beyond type. His motivation (making sense of his survival and guilt via the box) is clear and consistent, and his final reframing of the box from accusation to companion feels earned. The contradiction between “hard softness” and “granite-hard grief” runs through his choices rather than being merely stated. A small limitation is that his conflict stays largely in one register of grief/guilt without a sharper moment of irrationality or self-sabotage to complicate him further.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elian’s core drive—to test a “science of hopeful trajectories” and revitalize possibility—is clear and consistent, and his competence is well dramatized through his methodical setup. The logical/dreaming tension is named but only lightly dramatized; we’re told his mind “warred” more than we feel contradictory impulses in action. Emotional texture tends toward abstraction (“revitalize… the very fabric of possibility”) rather than embodied feeling, which mutes the impact of his breakthrough. His shift at the end (recognizing himself as the locus of the gauge’s certainty) is earned conceptually but carries little visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara is clearly motivated and professionally grounded, and her reactions to the discoveries are plausible, but her interiority remains fairly generalized and low-conflict. The decision to "continue Thorne's work" lands as an affirmation rather than a hard, costly choice. Contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure are mostly absent. As a result, she feels competent and earnest but not yet deeply individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The painter’s vocation, lineage, and ritual focus are clear and consistent, giving her a distinct identity. However, she faces almost no on-page resistance, and we see few micro-choices under pressure beyond proceeding with the rite. Internal contradiction is hinted (perceptively calm outside, soaring spirit inside) but not really tested or forced into a trade-off. The final melancholy separation is felt but mild, more mood than a hard-won character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elian is clearly motivated—a weary idealist shaped by decades of loss—and the interior lens stays consistent, especially around the lifetime of solitude and compromise. However, most conflict is summarized rather than dramatized, so contradictory impulses (idealism vs. cynicism, hope vs. fear of failure) rarely collide in specific on-page choices. The signature-as-redemption moment is strong but arrives more as a stated insight than a hard-fought decision we witness. Relationships with the factions are gestured at but never dramatized as crucibles that force visibly different behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a well-realized bundle of contradictions—amoral profiteer and genuine aesthete—and his interiority around the egg, drought, and birdsong feels specific rather than generic guilt. His sentimental quirks (childhood toys in a vault, secret tears at symphonies) concretize the label “secretly sentimental.” The final act of placing the egg reads as an earned extension of those traits rather than a sudden conversion. Some lines (“his morality was as flexible as his finances,” “divided soul”) lapse into label and cliché, slightly flattening what is otherwise a strong, textured portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation—to transcend a prescribed role through inner chastity and rebellion—is clear and consistent, and her lineage (seven generations) adds weight. However, her interiority leans toward archetype and abstraction rather than specific, contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece tells us she has preserved her essence and defied expectations, but we see little lived struggle or temptation in scene as she performs the ritual. Her final transformation feels thematically earned but emotionally low-friction, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is clear, consistent, and particular—his serenity, ethical rigor, and hybrid craft make him feel individual rather than generic. However, his interiority is mostly aligned and declarative; we rarely see genuine contradiction or a live moral struggle on the page, only his settled stance. The mentor conflict, which could expose sharper flaws and costs, sits off-stage and is summarized. The result is a compelling premise-person more than a fully tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s motivation—to witness and honor vanishing patterns—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, and their interiority feels particular (the knotting ritual, the reading of environmental cues). However, their emotional palette skews toward a single hue of reverent melancholy, with limited on-page contradiction or genuine ambivalence under pressure. The final alignment of their heartbeat toward “harmony” is earned but not sharply contested by any opposing impulse. Character reads vivid and specific, but the arc is more confirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her history and craft, and her embodied focus on the rope and names feels character-particular. However, most of the guilt/forgiveness conflict is already resolved before the story opens, leaving her with relatively little live internal contradiction under pressure. Her final decision to stay as keeper is emotionally plausible but arrives without much on-page struggle. A bit more friction between her longing for atonement and the cost of permanent guardianship would deepen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation and history are clear and specific, and her condition meaningfully shapes her life choices and current experiment. However, her emotional life remains somewhat abstract—there’s limited embodied conflict or contradiction on the page as she undertakes the ritual. The breakthrough arrives with minimal hesitation, fear, or inner push-pull in the climactic beats, so the transformation feels a bit too smooth. Overall she’s distinct and coherent, but not yet deeply complex.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    Anu’s core motive—bridging science and faith via the tile—is clear and consistent, and his frugality and devotion color his choices. However, his internal conflict is largely told rather than dramatized in contradictory in-scene impulses, so the climactic covenant feels a bit too smooth. Embodied emotion is fairly muted; we get awe and resolve but little fear, doubt, or physical response beyond “trembling fingers.” The final transformation is conceptually motivated but lacks a strongly felt personal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marcus’s hurt and resentment are clear, and his transformation traces back to on-page experiences, but the internal struggle feels abbreviated once the cellular memory device appears. Elara’s “scheming pacifist” nature is largely told rather than dramatized; we see gentle guidance but not much genuinely fraught manipulation. The reconciliation with his brother reads emotionally plausible but too smooth for the scale of betrayal invoked. More contradictory impulses under pressure would better earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mirror maker has clear motivation rooted in tradition and philosophy, and his craft-specific interiority feels particular. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict: the final refusal to "capture" the dream is not strongly contested or costly on the page. Emotion stays largely in a calm, reverent register, so we see more competence than struggle. This keeps the arc from reaching full depth despite a coherent throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation and emotional life are clear and particular—her history as a mender who failed her own daughter informs every choice she makes in the cathedral. The grief/hope contradiction is present but could be dramatized with sharper, more conflicted micro-choices under pressure. The daughter’s absence is effective, though their relationship remains somewhat idealized and abstracted. The final hope around the seed feels earned but lightly costed, more tender than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s curiosity and long-standing obsession with forbidden knowledge are clear and consistent, and the childhood memory of “temporal ripples” gives him a credible origin. However, his interior conflict is largely asserted rather than dramatized; he decides to “risk everything” without much on-page hesitation or push-pull. Embodied emotion appears in a few strong moments (forehead against the cool wall, “weight of collapsing stars”) but the piece leans more on cosmic abstractions than on specific, character-particular reactions. The final transformation into someone willing to step beyond temporal boundaries is conceptually earned but lacks a concrete felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and coherent—rescue plus intellectual hunger—but her interiority stays mostly in summary mode, with little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle. Emotions are gestured at (“racing heart,” “sparked hope”) rather than deeply embodied in specific sensations or irrational impulses. The relationship to the mentor’s colleague is thinly sketched, so the personal stake never quite bites. Her closing resolve feels plausible but somewhat costless, more affirmed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim scattered pieces of self via others’ memories and then to give voice to the forgotten—is clear and consistent. Her interiority is specific enough to feel individual (e.g., homesickness for lives never lived), but she rarely faces sharply contradictory impulses or a difficult trade-off on the page. Emotional states are mostly conveyed in controlled, reflective language rather than through stressed, embodied contradiction. The final shift to “true purpose” is earned but lands more as calm recognition than as a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor is clearly motivated (translate confusion into clarity, solve the Croft mystery) and her archivist habits show up in concrete actions like laying out tools and photographing the rope. However, she experiences almost no internal conflict or genuine hesitation despite explicit warnings in the “fables of absence,” which flattens complexity. Her competence is persuasive but untested; there’s no visible flaw or blind spot that meaningfully complicates her choice. The final meeting with Croft feels earned but emotionally undercharged because the cost to her personally never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation is clear and consistent—preserving the ripple marks and “find[ing] the quiet in the storm”—and their action path (Ice Sanctum → pattern → bloom of hush) aligns with that. However, interiority is thin and almost uniformly serene; there’s little contradictory impulse or embodied fear as the caves are threatened. The ease and composure of their success makes the final peace feel more like a demonstration of capacity than a hard‑won change with cost. The character reads distinct, but not yet fully humanly complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—restore the beacon as a way to prove hidden meaning—but she remains more emblematic than fully human. Her retrocognition and dedication are nicely particular, yet we see little genuine internal contradiction or cost beyond “burden and purpose.” The emotional beats are often told in abstract (“her heart filled with thistle-blown hope”) rather than grounded in embodied, character-specific reaction. The final realization changes her stance but doesn’t clearly foreclose an alternate path or expose a meaningful flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elthion’s vocation and worldview are clear and specific, and “preemptively nostalgic” gives him a distinct emotional tint, especially in lines like “already cherishing the moment before it had passed.” However, he faces almost no real dilemma or contradictory impulse on the page; his choices (go to the forecourt, listen, write, stay below) are all aligned with his stated purpose and carry no visible cost. The late “purpose crystallize[d] with sudden clarity” feels more like articulation than a hard-won turn. Strong conception, but limited dramatic testing of character.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—he’s come to the fortress to create a “light of hope”—and his professional habits (chanting, ambient awareness, care with chemicals) feel grounded. However, he faces almost no real resistance, and we see little contradiction or vulnerability under pressure, so he reads as competent but somewhat flat. Emotional embodiment stays mostly at the atmospheric level rather than in specific, conflicted feelings in his body. The final shift in him (satisfaction, readiness to move on) is credible but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is clearly motivated (texture-of-time research, ancestral legacy) and her interiority feels particular to her vocation, with the tidal pools and cicada shaping how she thinks. The internal turn from anxiety about funding to reframing constraint as method is earned by prior setup, though it resolves a bit smoothly, with little visible ambivalence or cost. Professor Aris is mostly a foil and never quite becomes a true source of pressure, which limits relational depth. Emotional states skew toward articulated insight rather than embodied contradiction, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and specific—the obsession with “flavors of different silences” and terror of confinement give her a distinct, non-generic interior life. The conflict between her bunker-born claustrophobia and skyward yearning is clear and consistent, and her preparation over seven years grounds her choice to risk the ascent. Emotional states are more often told than fully embodied in scene, and the father–child relationship remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized. The closing reconfiguration (doll vs. vessel; fear vs. understanding) feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s motivation (using silence to comfort travelers) is clear and consistent, and his professional competence is well rendered. However, his interiority remains abstract and serene; we rarely see specific, embodied emotion or any genuine struggle under pressure. There’s no visible internal contradiction or cost to his choices, which keeps his arc from feeling transformative. As a result, he reads more as a gentle function of the premise than as a fully complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core motivation (fulfilling the prophecy and preparing the throne for the true heir) is clear and consistent, and her role as lore keeper gives her a specific professional texture. However, her interiority remains relatively generalized—she feels “excitement and apprehension,” but we don’t see many sharp, character-specific contradictions under pressure. Her choices are almost always competent and untroubled, so we don’t see flaws or blind spots complicating the quest. The final renunciation of power is thematically apt but emotionally under-earned because no real temptation or alternative path was dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadow keeper’s careful, bridge-burning temperament and her buried sense of duty create a credible internal conflict that motivates the final choice. Her motivations (craved solitude vs obligation to suffocating souls) are clear and consistent, with the scars as a strong emotional anchor. However, her interiority is more archetypal than idiosyncratically personal, so the change feels resonant but not deeply singular. The suffocating person is a functional mirror rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s backstory and motivation (pyramid scheme survivor seeking redemption and transformation) are clear and consistent, and her curiosity-driven, scientifically minded nature is legible. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: she rarely feels genuinely torn between risk, greed, fear, or ethics in scene. Emotions skew toward summary (“her curiosity grew stronger each day”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final ‘guardian of a miracle’ stance feels more asserted than earned through hard choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Motivation is clear and consistent—he wants to end a deceptive dynasty through uncovering truth—and his competence is well established, but he rarely feels pressured or internally conflicted. Emotional life is summarized rather than embodied (“his heart steady despite the momentous nature of his discovery”), which flattens potential complexity. We never see a real tug between fear, loyalty to ancestors, or self-preservation and his mission. The final choice to present the evidence is conceptually sound but carries little felt inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Galen’s longing “to capture the shape of possibility” and his retreat from the kingdom give him a distinct, coherent psychology, and his choice to perform the ritual rather than remain in safe study feels motivated. However, his internal conflict is relatively low-friction—there’s little sense of genuine risk or competing values beyond a vague caution—and his final self-reframing (“not from cowardice, but… meant for something beyond ordinary service”) borders on an unearned clarity rather than a hard-won, messy realization. The embodiment of emotion (trembling fingers, tingling body) works but leans on familiar gestures. The change at the end is credible but not deeply costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eleanor is clearly motivated by grief, loneliness, and a need to make meaning from records, and her choice to investigate the button feels organic and grounded in those traits. Her interiority is reasonably specific (dust signatures, focus on small kindnesses), though some feelings are summarized rather than embodied. The final kinship with Benjamin is earned, but internal contradiction (her chosen solitude vs. desire for connection) could be dramatized more under pressure rather than explained. Benjamin, arriving late, is sketched efficiently but remains more emblem than fully realized person.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent—she feels like a practiced operative with a defined goal—but we get very little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. Her emotional life skews summarized (“filled her with determination”) rather than embodied. Theodor is thinly drawn, mostly a plot function. The closing choice to risk everything to transfer the data is believable but not deeply reconfigured by prior inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ethan’s motivation is clear and consistent—silencing the prophecy—and his craft-based solution feels rooted in who he is, not arbitrary magic. However, his interiority is relatively one-note: there’s little simultaneous pull between guilt, loyalty to his mentor, fear of failure, and doubt about whether silencing the prophecy is right. Emotion is often summarized (“eerie nostalgia”) rather than dramatized in a character-particular way. The final sense of release is plausible but not strongly earned through visible inner struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara is specific and memorable—her orderly nature, seed-stained fingers, and ritualized work clearly define her. Her motivation (decoding the leaves for the dwellers below) is established and followed through, and her competence feels earned. However, she encounters almost no resistance or hard choice, so we don’t see genuine internal conflict or a costly decision. The “transformation” is treated as a familiar, almost pleasant inevitability rather than something that strains her.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias has a clear arc from rigidity to acceptance, but interior conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in specific, embodied moments. His emotions are labeled (“terrifying and liberating”) more than shown in concrete behavior under pressure. The key realization about unpredictability feels a bit tidy and unopposed on the page. Still, his vocation and actions (using broken clock parts, studying natural clocks) coherently reflect his motives.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation (guilt over losing the coin, desire to honor Lumina and understand the “weight of names”) is clear and consistent, and his decision to create a new coin is a credible, character-driven response. The interiority is mostly specific (“luminous regret,” “golden seam in his broken heart”), not generic. However, his inner conflict is relatively tidy: regret → acceptance → renewed purpose, with little on-page resistance or self-sabotage, which flattens complexity. The “balanced alchemist complete at last” line feels a bit too resolved and slogan-like for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s vocation, family legacy, and specific method make him feel particular rather than generic, and his motivation (sister, laughter-as-healing) is clear and consistent. However, his interior conflict is light: we’re told about colleagues’ disdain and personal tragedy but don’t see these tensions meaningfully complicate his on-page choices. Thomas is sketched with one strong fear (“I’m afraid I’ll forget how to laugh”) but remains thin beyond that. The final choice to free Thomas feels earned, but it doesn’t demand much sacrifice or contradiction from Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kai’s interiority is vivid and physically grounded (“every breath felt like inhaling shards of glass”), and his drive to decode his trauma into “mathematics of mercy” is clear and character-specific. The contradiction between his hyper-attuned body and his attempt at cold abstraction is compelling, though his emotional journey proceeds a bit too smoothly toward insight, with limited on-page resistance or self-deception. Some therapy/diagnostic language (“trauma responses,” “enhanced interrogation survivor”) slightly flattens him into a type rather than a wholly idiosyncratic mind. The final realization about mercy feels earned but not deeply costly—he reaches a framework without confronting a concrete, painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s motivation and vocation are clear and consistent, and the grandmother backstory gives her a believable through-line. However, her inner life under pressure is thin: there’s little contradiction, fear, or doubt when she’s “prepar[ing] to unfasten the final lock.” Because no relationship is actually on the page in the present, we lose a crucible that might expose sharper facets of her. The final acceptance of her role feels largely preordained, with minimal visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.6)
    Marcus’s motivation (curiosity, professional obsession with vertical spaces, desire to understand his ghost-sight) is clear and consistent, and his occupational lens gives him some specificity. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict or moral ambiguity; the choice to “engage” with the spirits reads as a natural extension of his established traits rather than a difficult, costly turn. Emotional experience is more labeled than embodied, with only light tension between fear and fascination. The closing shift from “curse to calling” is conceptually earned but not deeply dramatized as a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eldon’s core motive (compressing eternity to salvage a lost past) is clear and consistent, and his profession colors his perceptions nicely. However, we get little in-the-moment conflict or contradiction—he rarely doubts, resists, or chooses under pressure once the whisper appears. After the rupture, he mostly witnesses rather than acts, which softens the sense of character-driven cost. The final realization feels earned conceptually but not deeply dramatized through embodied emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias is clearly motivated and internally coherent—failed revolutionary, now turning his fervor toward reimagining history—but his struggle stays mostly conceptual and unopposed on the page. His poet’s sensibility and disillusioned idealism feel specific, especially in how he treats the shard as a vessel of stories. However, internal contradiction under pressure is soft; he never has to seriously doubt or risk himself beyond committing to the manuscript. The final “change” is more a clarified stance than a costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s vocation, devotion to music, and attachment to his grandmother’s box are clear and coherent, and his actions all align with this motivation. However, he reads as almost entirely noble and competent, with little in the way of flaw, blind spot, or internal contradiction. Emotional states are more often summarized than embodied, which flattens his experience under pressure. The ending doesn’t force him into a costly or ambiguous choice; it reaffirms what we already know about him.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivations are clear, consistent, and rooted in concrete, character-specific obsessions (petrichor, solitude, liminal states), and her competence in both science-adjacent collecting and occult psychometry feels unified rather than convenient. The hinge from “sensibly eccentric” neighbor to initiate of a deeper mystery is earned by long-term habits and the auctioned compass. However, internal conflict is muted: she never seriously doubts, fears, or resists the pull of the lagoon, so contradictory impulses under pressure are limited. The shift at the end is a believable repricing of her life’s work, but the cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena has a clear role and vocation, but her interiority leans on labels (“spirited,” “perpetually learning”) and prompt-words rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Her shift from disorientation to cosmic insight happens with minimal struggle once the slide appears, which flattens the emotional arc. We rarely see concrete, character-specific embodiment of her feelings beyond being “inspired.” The final stance feels lightly earned rather than wrestled-into.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s obsession and gentleness are clearly motivated and consistent, with her long pursuit of the nocturnal flowers and her quiet determination at the cathedral reading as grounded traits. However, her interiority is relatively one-note—more devoted than conflicted—and we don’t see much simultaneous contradiction or messy emotion. The final reorientation of her life’s question is believable but emotionally under-strained, with little sense of what it costs her beyond a gentle pivot in understanding. Character reads vivid but not deeply fissured or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Ellara’s professional and personal motivations are clear and consistent, and her actions (requesting the detour, creating the beach messages, publishing the history) track with them. However, her interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with little on-page contradiction or genuinely difficult choice. The emotional cost of her decisions—especially publishing the “unvarnished history”—is asserted more than embodied. She reads interesting but somewhat schematic rather than fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elior’s core motivation—to revive the town through deeper, non-magical transformation—is clear and consistent, and his final decision to start community meetings is causally grounded. However, his interiority is largely thesis-driven rather than embodied or conflicted; we get very little contradiction, irrational fear, or cost on the page beyond abstract “false comfort.” The epiphany about the bottle as metaphor reads somewhat unearned because it arrives via exposition instead of being struggled toward in scene. Relationships are almost entirely offstage, so his change happens in a vacuum rather than in a crucible with other people.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is sharply etched—his vocation, lineage, and shifting ambition are vivid, and his reaction to the prophecy (fear, responsibility, “velvet disquiet”) feels particular rather than generic. However, his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; he moves fairly smoothly from curiosity to acceptance of a new burden without a real on-page struggle or contradictory impulses in the moment. The cost of his new role (what he sacrifices or endangers) remains abstract. Strong, specific interiority, but not yet at the depth of a top-tier literary character study.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anya’s motivation—wanting to experience “borrowed time” before her own runs out—is vivid, specific, and drives every choice, from barefoot sorting in subzero cold to risking the vortex. Her interiority is filtered through concrete ritual (handling jars, the warmth of the acorn cap) rather than labels, and the “furious tranquility” contradiction feels embodied. The shift from archivist/recorder to participant in time reads as an earned internal change. The one soft spot is that her fear or reluctance never meaningfully pushes back against her drive, so internal conflict remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and convictions are sharply etched, and his motivation—to prove the bell and the mountain’s “voice” superior to digital noise—is clear and consistent. However, he experiences almost no visible internal contradiction or emotional struggle; he’s serenely right from the outset. His competence is strong but untested on the page, so the final smile feels like confirmation rather than earned change. This keeps the arc from reaching elite depth.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elion’s motivation and worldview are clear and consistent (spiritual curiosity, desire to connect with falling stars), and his choice to leave the station aligns with these traits. However, his interiority leans abstract and generalized, with little embodied emotion or specific contradiction under pressure. We rarely see concrete physical reactions or moments where conflicting impulses (duty vs. longing, fear vs. curiosity) clash in-scene. The change he undergoes feels more told than viscerally earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The recluse’s motivation is coherent and sustained—drawn to silence, then accepting the role of covenant-keeper—but they remain more emblematic than individually human. Emotional states are mostly implied via stance rather than embodied with specific, contradictory feelings, so internal conflict is subdued. The key choice (to sit wordlessly with the box) is credible and earned but carries limited dramatized cost beyond a conceptual acceptance of duty. This works well for a mythic mode, but for elite literary venues, the character lacks the textured, idiosyncratic inner life that would fully earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core drive—to understand the “texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and her profession and routines feel specific rather than generic. However, she faces little on-page pressure that forces contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs; she largely receives revelations rather than earning them through fraught choices. Emotional reactions are mostly summarized (“Her heart raced…”) instead of being deeply embodied or internally complicated. The final sense of purpose comes a bit too cleanly, without visible cost or unresolved flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s sensibility and motivation (“to discover beauty in the incomplete”) are clear, consistent, and embodied in how she attends to the lagoon and the kite. However, internal conflict is minimal; she is largely at peace with her worldview, so we don’t see strong contradictory impulses in scene. The small shift—feeling released after the kite snaps—is credible but low-cost. Character reads specific and non-generic, but the arc is gentle rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—turning a death sentence into a purposeful deadline—but he experiences almost no genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. His “brazen calm” remains untested, and moments like the arthritis flare are noted rather than dramatized as crises of choice. The result is a sympathetic but somewhat one-note interiority. His final acceptance feels earned but emotionally smoothed over rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elian’s core motivation—proving his “chemistry of homecoming” theory—is clear and consistent, and his shift from skeptic to believer is legible if a bit quick. However, his interior life skews abstract and declarative (“luminous skeptic,” “academically rebellious”) rather than embodied in specific, pressured contradictions. We rarely feel a true tug-of-war between his scientific skepticism and quasi-spiritual longing; the doubt dissolves too smoothly once the amber glows. More concrete emotional and bodily responses undercutting his intellectual certainties would be needed for elite-level depth.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman’s core motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and his choices (undertaking the journey, heeding the bird’s “western hollow first”) are aligned with his goal. However, his psychology remains serenely purposeful: there’s little contradictory impulse, fear, doubt, or selfishness to complicate him under pressure. The “speaks dead languages” trait hints at an eccentric, haunted inner life that isn’t fully dramatized in specific, embodied reactions. The ending gives him a satisfying endurance arc, but with minimal visible emotional cost beyond fatigue and quiet satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s longing and purpose are clear and consistent, and the use of his “bloodhound” past to inform his present perception is strong and character-specific. However, his interior conflict is relatively thin: he rarely wavers or wrestles with doubt, and the journey is emotionally smooth. The relationship with Elara is mostly idealized in summary rather than dramatized, so the reunion carries less complicated feeling than it could. The final choice to leave the settlement and then to adjust course at the second cylinder is motivated but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—enduring isolation to preserve cosmic knowledge—is clear and consistent, and her role as “blessed pariah” has some texture. However, her interiority leans on abstractions and repetition (“gift and a curse,” “blessed with a burden”) rather than concrete, individualized reactions under pressure. We see little in the way of simultaneous contradictory impulses; she is lonely yet purposeful, but that tension is asserted more than dramatized. The closing realization that “her true north had been within her all along” feels tidy rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kael’s motivations are clear and consistent (prove himself, fix the sky, embrace the unknown), and his “chivalrous thief” code is at least sketched rather than merely labeled. However, internal conflict is minimal: once he decides to climb, nothing seriously tests or complicates his values on the page. His emotional life is mostly summarized (“cautious abandon,” “sacredly playful”) instead of dramatized in specific contradictions under pressure. The master reads as a flat expositor rather than a fully realized counterforce or relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a “historian of small gestures” is specific and consistent, and her benevolent/ruthless tension is clearly articulated, especially when she acknowledges she can’t save everyone’s memories. Interiority is textured (her relationship to the nomadic penumbra and the pawns) and shows a distinct worldview. However, her conflict remains mostly conceptual; we’re told about her ruthlessness more than we see it enacted in a hard, choice-driven moment. The emotional arc is credible but a bit too tidy, with limited on-page contradiction under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maven’s core motivation (“understand the shape of home”) is clear and carried through to the end, and her interiority is gently particular (the mercury-glass shield, the pain of remembering). However, her emotional life stays relatively smooth; we don’t see strong contradictory impulses operating simultaneously in scene, only a steady drift from lost → empowered. The epiphany that she’s been substituting reality nightly is told rather than dramatized, which softens the cost and immediacy of that self-discovery. Her final stance feels earned in theme, but less so as a psychologically complex turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tutor’s guilt, exile, and disciplined habit of “productive fidgeting” give him a clear, specific psychology, and his forty years of penance motivate his present choices. However, his internal conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page; he moves fairly smoothly from guilt to readiness. The prince, though important symbolically, is more emblem than character, arriving too late to feel like an active crucible for his struggle. The final self-forgiveness feels credible but slightly too tidy given the depth of the original failure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s driving motive—defying a singular truth through poetry—is clear and consistent, and her willingness to risk sacrifice is credibly established. However, her interiority is mostly abstract and declarative, with little embodied emotion or specific, pressured micro-choices on the page. The “innocently mischievous” quality is told rather than dramatized in concrete behavior. The final stance (“I am truth’s reflection, not its container”) feels thematically apt but not earned through visible internal contradiction resolved in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcel’s motivation—using alchemy and ritualized remembrance to mend a shattered past—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in his actions with the charm and statue. His emotional texture (grief, uncertainty, reverence) feels particular rather than stock, with good use of physicalization (trembling, touch, breath control). However, internal conflict is underplayed: he largely moves in one direction toward insight, so the final realization feels a bit too clean and unopposed. The change at the end is credible but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is well-drawn as a grieving, solitary artist whose history with the quay, his wife, and his art coherently motivates his actions. The hidden promise and the seashell revelation give him a credible inner life and a modest but real turn in understanding. However, his inner conflict remains relatively smooth—he moves from melancholy to renewal without much on-page resistance or contradiction in the peak beats. A touch more messiness or competing impulses under pressure would deepen him to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s longing and need to prove his theory are clear and embodied in small choices (keeping the cork secret, choosing a whisper over a shout), and the moment of felt connection lands. However, internal contradiction is mild—he never seriously wavers or risks anything beyond emotion—and Captain Morgan is sketched more as a function (skeptic turned mild believer) than a fully pressured character. The sister’s half-world-away beat is affecting but thinly characterized. The final change feels emotionally credible but comes at little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.6)
    The navigator is distinct and textured (scarred, patched body, talismanic relationship to the censer), with a clear, consistent drive to guide others home. However, there is little in-the-moment contradiction or live internal conflict; the story largely affirms an existing purpose rather than testing it. Micro-choices under pressure are present but mild (accepting the phone’s demand, rearranging equipment) and rarely feel risky. The final stance of quiet endurance is credible but not hard-earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and coherent—her need for psychological safety in the wake of the empathy virus drives every choice, and the truffle-forager detail grounds her competence and habits. Interiority is specific enough (“her voice cracking from disuse,” the trading of “three winter's worth of premium truffles”) to individualize her. What’s missing at this level is active contradiction under pressure—she never truly wavers between options or pays an on-page relational price in the scene itself, so the change at the end feels slightly tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias is cleanly sketched as a particular person—his record-keeping, lack of telephone, and “nightly conversations with the stars” all pay into a coherent, slightly odd but sympathetic interiority. His motivation to investigate and then to make sense of the gesture is consistent and credible, and his final mimicked gesture feels earned. What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper on-page contradiction under pressure—his isolation vs. longing for connection is stated and implied but never quite forced into a painful, dramatized clash. The emotional cost of accepting the borrowed memories and performing the gesture remains a bit too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s loneliness, vocation, and quiet receptivity are well-established, and his decision to leave the shop and then choose a doorway is clearly motivated by the mentor’s promise and his dissatisfaction. However, his inner conflict remains mostly summarized (“Elias spent hours contemplating each doorway”) rather than dramatized in specific competing impulses, so the decisive choice feels a bit too smooth. More embodied hesitation or fear would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s disenchantment and yearning for meaning are clearly motivated and drive her choice to defy the counselors and seek the grotto. Her inner experience, however, remains relatively smooth and tidy; we don’t see much contradictory impulse at the cave itself (terror vs duty vs desire), just rapid acceptance. Maera functions mostly as a guide and expositor rather than a fully pressured relationship, though her presence does add emotional texture. The final reorientation toward purpose is credible but could carry more visible inner cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply sketched: her “scientifically romantic” worldview, attachment to the nautilus, and pocket-sun craft give her a distinct interiority and credible motivation for the final revaluation of her art. Her emotional state—anticipation, anxiety, then a charged shift—is present but often rendered in abstract terms rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Leo, by contrast, functions more as a catalyst than a character, with minimal interior or visible struggle. The change she undergoes is clear and earned, but the lack of concrete cost or frictive choice keeps this shy of top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s vocation and inner life feel specific and textured—“cartographer of consciousness” and his jealousy of past selves are memorable, character-particular moves. His core motivation (to distill chaos into narrative) is clear and his emotions are embodied through the cabin, the scroll, and the grave vision rather than labels. The internal contradiction between jaded knowledge and yearning for old ignorance is present but could be stressed more sharply at the decision point. The closing recommitment to chronicling reads earned but low-cost, more affirmation than hard-won sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is sharply sketched—her history with scent, her adaptation to water clocks, and her tactile reading of objects all feel particular and consistent. Her motivation post-loss is clear, but her internal conflict is relatively mild; the transition from grief to new purpose is more told than pressured. The relationship with Lena is tender but low-friction, so we see little in the way of contradictory impulses under stress. The warmth she feels at the end is earned, yet the cost of her earlier loss is kept mostly conceptual rather than embodied in a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives are clear and specific—turning her scars into protective stories—and her fear of crystallization plays directly against that desire in the moment. Interiority is concrete and embodied (trembling fingers, breath control, sensory recall of the garden). The contradictory impulses (panic vs. ritual focus, shame/fear vs. duty to future scholars) appear in-scene rather than as summary. The one limitation is that her final success comes without much ongoing ambivalence or visible post-cost beyond fatigue and awe, which keeps the arc slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Eloise’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and particular, with her professional competence in tension with private remorse, and her micro-choices (adjusting equipment, clutching the bottle, choosing her words) feel consistent. The relationship dynamic with Beatrice has texture—wry, wounded, and cautiously forgiving—though we see more acceptance than active resistance, which slightly softens pressure. Emotional embodiment is solid (dust on her cheeks, the weight of the bottle) but the internal conflict could bite harder in the moment of contact. The final endurance—accepting an incomplete reconciliation—is believable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The witness has a clear, consistent motivation and a legible arc from translucence to solidity, but reads more as an archetypal function than a psychologically particular person. Interiority is almost entirely thematic rather than embodied; we rarely feel how this work costs them emotionally or physically. There is no real internal contradiction or value trade-off dramatized in the moment of unification. The final choice to complete the work is thus conceptually motivated but not deeply character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arlo’s core motivation is clear and specific—he wants to understand what clocks truly measure—and his actions with the hydraulic clock and key align with that drive. However, his emotional life remains relatively one-note (quiet curiosity shading into serene wisdom) with little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle. The shift from unease with “fjord quiet” to serene acceptance feels plausible but lightly earned, as almost nothing resists his realization. His final renunciation (wearing the key, vowing not to use it “conventionally”) has minimal visible cost, which limits the depth of his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara’s role and surface motivation are clear, and her emotional state is sketched with some concrete images (“quiet wildfire”), but her interior conflict is underdeveloped. She moves fairly smoothly from suspicion to communion without much dramatized resistance or contradictory impulse. The closing realization about “the physics of letting go” feels thematically neat rather than psychologically hard-won. Her choices align with her role, yet they rarely expose sharper flaws, blind spots, or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is specific, with a clear paradox at her core: a probability professor shaped by a compulsive gambler father, and this contradiction informs her mission and perceptions. Her interiority is textured and individualized (e.g., cataloguing “lucid contradictions,” the mix of thrill and skepticism at the Fibonacci encryption). However, we rarely see her make hard on-page choices under pressure; her realizations feel largely contemplative rather than costly. The emotional shift toward peace is believable but a bit tidy, with limited dramatized struggle in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias is clearly sketched with a specific history (wife’s departure, failed musical career) and a coherent core drive toward estrangement and quiet service. His shift from self-exile to active expectation of “wrong number” calls feels motivated by Meredith’s grief. However, the interior conflict is more told than dramatized; we’re informed of his beliefs and past rather than feeling them under immediate pressure. The resolution does carry a cost (relinquishing pure solitude) but that cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s motives and contradictions (clinging to analog preservation while walking toward digitization) are clear and particular, with “haunted euphoria” reading as a lived tension rather than a label. His care with the vial, the timed steeping, and the act of drawing under a deadline all externalize his interior values. The endurance/renunciation at the end—turning from his “church” toward an uncertain future—feels earned and costly. A slight over-reliance on stated philosophy (“weight of small moments”) edges toward telling, but it doesn’t undercut the core characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Archie has a clear, particular inner life—disaster logistician, lunar legacy, reciprocity, and desperate jocularity all cohere into a distinctive psychology. His loneliness is convincingly rooted in his work and his relationship to the fake moon rock, and his tactics (rumor, certificates, neutral ground) arise credibly from those traits. However, almost all of this is told rather than dramatized in a scene with another person, so we never see his contradictions tested in live interaction. The final “repricing” of what the cure really is feels earned but emotionally muted because we’ve only watched him at arm’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elion’s grief, vocation, and drive toward the stillpoint are clear and specific, and the link between his blindness, his sensory gift, and his work as a mapmaker feels organically motivated. However, his internal conflict is largely stated rather than dramatized, and contradictory impulses (fear of reopening grief vs. desire for resolution) rarely surface as live, in-scene tension. The final shift from grief to readiness to “chart a new path” feels somewhat streamlined, with minimal visible cost beyond tears. This keeps the arc from reaching a more complex, fully earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motivation (guilt over the misread signal) is clear and plausibly pushes her to use the pen, and her “confidently uncertain” stance fits the premise. However, her emotions are mostly narrated in abstract terms (“guilt into determination,” “strange comfort”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or contradictory impulses within a scene. The central act with the pen carries little visible psychological struggle; she moves from intention to execution with minimal friction. The closing promise to the universe feels earned but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s role, motivation, and limitation (never remembered) are clear and consistent, and the mother backstory adds a specific emotional root. However, his interiority remains abstractly stated (“joyful sorrow”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or concrete sensations. The young woman and others function more as emblems than pressured individuals, so relationships don’t quite become crucibles. The final endurance—continuing work despite being forgotten—carries cost but isn’t deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s guilt, history as an arsonist-librarian, and vow to “protect the stories” give her a distinct, coherent psychology, and the reveal that the curator mirrors her deepens that. However, most of her struggle is narrated in summary—“For weeks, she followed the artistic trail…”—rather than dramatized in concrete, pressured choices. Her final turn toward redemption feels emotionally apt but relatively tidy, with limited on-page ambivalence or relapse impulse. The interiority is specific but could use more embodied contradiction at key beats (e.g., restoring the portrait, deciding not to return above ground).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent—her quiet rebellion and desire to reanimate the shared dream drive every choice, from panel-hacking to the tower ritual. Interiority is specific enough to feel personal (the drumming, her read of Sorenson), and actions align well with her traits. The biggest limitation is the relative lack of contradictory impulses or visible internal clash under peak pressure; she rarely feels truly torn. Theo registers only as a presence, not a fully dramatized personality, so the relationship’s emotional complexity remains somewhat idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlo is clearly sketched—competent, quietly subversive, with a tactile relationship to his tools and environment—and his motive to undercut Vance’s loud efficiency doctrine is coherent. However, his internal conflict remains muted: we don’t feel much risk, fear, or doubt about confronting authority, so his success costs him little on the page. Vance is serviceable as a foil but thin, mostly an offstage shouter who never truly pressures Marlo emotionally. The ending adds a new map but not a new self-understanding, so the “change” is more procedural than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    The guardian and visitor are evocative figures but remain archetypal; their interior lives and contradictions never quite come into focus beyond “ancient duty” and “burdened by a secret.” Motivation is clear in a mythic sense yet under-tested: we never see the guardian strained or tempted to break their calm. The relationship dynamic is interesting—a secret pressing between them—but it doesn’t evolve beyond initial tension to a legibly altered bond. The final nod/turn away suggests an emotional shift, but the lack of concrete micro-choices makes that shift feel more conceptual than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Arthur’s motivation is clear and consistent—his distress at students’ conformity and desire to “plant forests of second thoughts” credibly drives the plan. However, he experiences almost no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulse under pressure, which flattens him into an emblem rather than a fully fraught person. The mind-reading gift has no emotional or practical cost, which is a missed opportunity for depth. The final change (from solitary coach to “fellow thinkers”) feels earned but emotionally under-complicated for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s yearning and emptiness are clearly established, and her final choice to leave her life behind is motivated by consistent traits and desire. However, her internal conflict is often summarized in abstract terms (“her heart a battlefield of hope and fear”) rather than dramatized through concrete, pressured micro-choices. Relationships and social ties stay largely off-page, so the cost of leaving feels conceptual more than embodied. The transformation is credible but not deeply particularized to her as an individual beyond role and longing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The performer’s motivation and history are clear and specific; his rituals, the bouquet, and the mandate years all reveal a coherent, idiosyncratic psyche. The Earned Stasis at the end—choosing equilibrium rather than cathartic transformation—feels consistent and motivated. However, interiority leans toward articulated thesis (“cultivate lightness in grief”) rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure. We get less sense of live ambivalence in the moment and more of a resolved stance being performed.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The poet’s desire—to reclaim forbidden artistic/transcendent experience—is clear and consistent, and their actions (journeying, touching the pillar, reciting the words) align with that motive. However, interiority leans abstract (“a flame of defiance,” “aesthetically driven soul”) rather than character-particular, and there is little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. The transformation arrives with minimal resistance or cost, so the final “new purpose” feels somewhat granted rather than wrestled for. The result is functional but not yet at the level of complex, embodied characterization expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—to barter an awakening for Gideon rather than herself—is clear and consistent, and the sacrifice of her own stated desire gives her a solid moral center. However, her internal conflict around losing vs. regaining color is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, so contradictory impulses never quite clash on the page. Gideon feels more like an emblem of aging and imperfection than a fully pressured character. The final acceptance of restored color arrives smoothly, without much visible emotional cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    The bell ringer is clearly motivated and consistent, but she remains more of a symbolic figure than a fully embodied person. Her desire “to discover the texture of connection” is told rather than tested by any genuinely difficult choice. Interiority is largely philosophical and serene; we rarely see contradictory impulses or emotional cost. The closing stance (continuing her work) thus feels like a gentle continuation rather than an earned, pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena’s motivation and history are clear and consistent, and her vocation is well integrated with her grief. However, her emotional life is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with almost no on-page micro-choices under pressure. We’re told she hit rock bottom and then found purpose, but we don’t feel that pivot through contradictory impulses in scene. The result is affecting but emotionally flatter and safer than it could be for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific, and his inheritance from his grandmother gives him some dimensionality. However, his interiority under pressure is thin: we don’t see much contradiction, doubt, or cost around his secret project or the choice to reveal it. The visitor remains largely a cipher with minimal distinguishing traits beyond intensity and professional alignment. The final “responsibility” beat lands conceptually but without a dramatized emotional struggle or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to reclaim forbidden, erased history—is clear and consistently dramatized, and the “anguish and joy” pairing gives her a distinct emotional texture. However, her inner conflict stays largely at the level of stated duality rather than being tested through concrete, conflicting impulses in specific beats. The final merging-with-the-archive choice feels motivated but relatively frictionless on the page, with little dramatized resistance. Strong, coherent, but not yet psychologically intricate enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, grief, and dedication are clearly articulated, and her emotional throughline from curiosity to regret is convincing. However, her inner life stays relatively singular—professionally dutiful and hopeful—without much dramatized contradiction or messy irrationality under pressure. Many key beats (“Night after night, she observed…”) are summarized rather than rendered as specific micro-choices, which flattens her complexity. The final regret feels earned but could cut deeper if her earlier blind spots and conflicts were more actively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is clear, consistent, and specific to her vocation; her tenderness with the chameleon and wounded trust feel plausibly rooted in her history. The core motivation—to reconcile self-respect with compassion—is well stated and tracked through the piece. However, her inner life skews a bit idealized and lucid, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure and some therapy-adjacent formulations (“fragile convictions,” “my own blindness”) that feel articulated rather than lived. The final shift toward “victim to survivor, betrayed to wise” reads a touch tidy and could carry more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s vocation as a “closure seeker who often opened wounds” is a strong, specific flaw that anchors her arc, and her final shift toward integration is legible and earned. Her interiority is clear and mostly concrete, with objects (hourglass, coffee rings, plants) revealing her instincts under pressure. However, the emotional struggle feels somewhat smoothed-over; she changes her core philosophy with little on-page resistance or contradictory impulse. A touch more friction or self-doubt at the tunnel decision would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elena’s core motive and role are clear and consistent, and the fusion of profession with mystic ability gives her a distinct profile. However, her interiority leans toward declarative abstraction rather than lived, scene-bound contradiction; we rarely see competing impulses or a real micro-choice under pressure. Her emotional responses (e.g., the single tear, sense of purpose) feel appropriate but somewhat generalized. The final sense of vocation is earned conceptually, yet the cost to her remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive (to unjam her creative block) is clear and consistent, and her sensitivity to “unspoken words” is a strong defining trait. However, her interiority stays at an archetypal, abstract level—more “moonstruck dreamer” than individuated person with specific, embodied contradictions. The shift from overload to integration feels somewhat declarative (“she now understood…”) rather than hard-won on the page. Emotional cost is touched (“bittersweet knowledge”) but not deeply dramatized in concrete, character-particular ways.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The guard’s motivation—to preserve “sparks” and divergent futures—is clear and consistent, and the dreamless vs. beginning-to-dream tension gives him a coherent arc. Interiority is particular enough (“I don’t dream… but I remember futures…”) to avoid genericness. However, his conflicts are mostly declared rather than dramatized in specific, pressured choices, so the emotional cost of his stance shift feels muted. The relationship with the Archivist hints at a richer crucible but never quite comes under real on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaelen’s core motivation and situation are clear, but he reads as an almost purely receptive vessel for insight rather than a conflicted person under pressure. His emotions skew abstract (“tone shifted to wonder”) rather than embodied, and we never see contradictory impulses in play. The transformation from questioning to wonder is asserted more than earned through micro-choices with visible cost. As a result, the arc feels more like a gentle upgrade than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris’s motivation and role are clear and consistent, and the collective identity of the guides has a distinct ethos, but there is almost no internal contradiction or emotional friction under pressure. They move from purpose to fulfillment with serenity rather than struggle, so the final redefinition of their task feels conceptually neat rather than hard-won. The lack of a meaningful inner conflict or visible cost at key beats keeps the characterization from higher literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.7)
    The bellhop’s motive—mourning lost music and seeking protection—links cleanly to his choices, especially when he decides to risk destabilizing the fortress by singing. His interiority is specific (nerve regeneration, phantom tingles, memory of harmony) rather than generic, and his final act feels earned by the accumulated hints that his injury was no accident. Internal conflict (safety vs. music) is present but could be dramatized more sharply through concrete imagined consequences of each path. The emotional shift at the end is credible, but the cost of defying the fortress could be embodied more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s goal and core traits are clear, and the final internal shift—from displaced heir to self-chosen guardian—does register as a meaningful change. However, the revelation that the pretender is her own fear of ruling isn’t strongly foreshadowed, so the specific nature of her flaw feels more told than dramatized. We get very little contradictory impulse on the page (no moment where her hunger for the throne clashes with avoidance), which softens the impact of the twist. Her emotions tend to be summarized in stately language rather than embodied in idiosyncratic reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina is specific—a long-term coral bleaching witness whose soothing tapping habit and isolation feel lived-in—but she rarely faces a sharpened choice under pressure. Her motivation to understand “why some paths disappear” is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction (drifting vs. duty-bound) is present but mostly asserted rather than tested in a concrete dilemma. The final acceptance of paths passing feels emotionally plausible yet arrives more as reflective insight than as a hard-earned, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist has a clear desire (“seeking something she couldn't name,” wanting to “reignite the flame”) and a consistent, if archetypal, sensibility (barefoot, stargazing, heirloom glasses). However, her interiority leans on generalized language and summary rather than specific, character-particular thought, and there’s almost no real internal contradiction or moral friction on the page. The final realization that “she was the meaning” feels asserted rather than fully earned through concrete, pressured micro-choices, so the change registers but without deep cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s motives are clear and consistent—protecting her community and redefining tradition—and her age and history as an “insurgent grandmother” give her strong specificity. The internal contradiction between her lifelong skepticism of prophecy and her emerging belief in “implanted destiny” is compelling but resolves too smoothly, with little felt cost in the final beat. Emotional experience is mostly summarized rather than embodied in crucial moments (e.g., the chamber finally opening). The closure choice feels earned but could be sharpened by showing more doubt or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s characterization is specific, embodied, and consistent, with clear trauma markers (jaw, breath) and concrete coping rituals that feel lived rather than generic. Her internal change—from clinging to the wedding photo to releasing it—is well prepared and costs her something. The “somatic markers” language edges toward therapy-speak but is grounded by sensory detail enough not to feel clinical. Overall, she reads as an individual, not a type, with a coherent value hierarchy around resilience and care.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    Eleanor’s motive—recovering her lost artistic “spark”—is clear and consistently rooted in her sense of failure, and her micro-choices (taking the box, deciding to untangle, drawing again) follow from that. Interiority is present and embodied (“fingers smudging the charcoal into gray oblivion”), but her emotional palette stays mostly on a single axis of sadness → insight without much contradiction or moral tension. The shift at the end—from despair to re-framed inspiration—feels earned but relatively low-cost and tidy. Strong but not yet piercingly complex characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tracker’s motivation (childhood-haunting crisis time dilation) is clear and coherently drives every choice, and details like albinism, isolation, and “consciously wild” lend specificity. However, interior conflict is comparatively thin: they never genuinely waver or reveal contradictory impulses around risk, only proceed. The line “Their albinism wasn’t just physical—it extended to their perception of reality” is thematically neat but feels told and slightly pat. The closing shift from serene anger to awe reads earned but could carry more on-page cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s role, history, and core contradiction (duty-bound archivist vs. desire to reveal truth) are clear and consistent, and her final choice to leak the document is well-motivated. However, the internal struggle is often summarized rather than dramatized (“bravely conflicted heart hammered”), which blunts the felt cost. Her emotional texture stays fairly idealized and principled, with limited irrationality or flaw beyond hesitation. The decisive shift from preserver to liberator lands, but the path there could show more messy resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhiannon is sharply sketched: her choice to nurture desert roses in opposition to her bounty-hunter lineage is clear and character-specific. Her motivation to “weave continuity through chaos” is consistently embodied in her gardening practice and repurposing of the sandbag scrap. However, her inner life is relatively unconflicted in the present scene; the tension with her father is entirely retrospective, so we don’t see contradictory impulses in action. The result is a strong but relatively low-pressure character study rather than a fully tested interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The fisher’s motivation (understanding, not power) is clear and consistent, and his patience/cool-headedness track through the ritual. However, his interiority remains archetypal rather than deeply particular; we rarely feel embodied fear, doubt, or conflicting impulses. The encounter with the goddess’s echo changes him in concept, but the emotional cost or internal reconfiguration is largely told rather than dramatized. This keeps him compelling as a figure, but not yet fully alive as a person.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor’s motivation (honor her father, seek truth, test the corruption narrative) is clear and consistent, and her competence is well established. However, her interiority skews tidy and rational, with little real contradiction or emotional mess under pressure. The “orbits of regret” vs. “orbits of determination/justice” shift sketches an arc but doesn’t feel costly or hard-won. She reads more as an idealized archetype than a fully complicated individual.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief, deafness, and obsessive need to quiet the ghost-cries of his daughter are specific and persuasive, and his professional detail (constellation tattooist) meaningfully colors how he perceives the firmware and the code. His motivation to “hush the dissonance of old guilt” clearly drives the tether attempt and the final choice to mark himself with musical notes. Internal conflict is somewhat one-note—guilt and longing dominate without much contradictory impulse or self-sabotage in scene. The emotional turn at the end feels earned but a touch easy because we don’t see him seriously doubt or fear the consequences of success or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas is clearly motivated—drawn to the grotto and driven to “discover meaning in the mess”—and his choice to interject via art rather than argument feels character-specific and earned. However, his inner conflict is thin: we don’t really see contradictory impulses or a meaningful risk in his decision, so his arc reads as steady rather than truly tested. The label “socially perceptive” is supported by his actions, but not deeply dramatized under pressure. The ending registers as a modest internal shift (from whimsical outsider to facilitator of collective meaning) rather than a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s motivation and nature as a “gentle radical” are clear and consistent, and his choice to rename the plaza is credibly rooted in his established purpose. However, he experiences little on-page internal contradiction or real struggle; he mainly enacts a settled role rather than being tested. Emotions are present but often summarized via lofty abstractions instead of concretely embodied, character-specific reactions. The survivors remain a silent mass, so relational pressure never sharpens his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s motivation—to save the garden that anchors his past and to keep performing—is clear and consistent, with the coin and stage concretely tied to his history. However, his interiority remains relatively straightforward; there’s little sense of active contradiction between his hunger for endless encores and the possibility of final rest. His emotions are mostly rendered through lyrical perception rather than conflicted decision-making under pressure. The final dissolution reads earned but low-cost because we never see him genuinely resist letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya’s core drive (helping her brother and victims) and trait blend (“affectionate skeptic”) are clear and consistent, and her eventual shift to conviction is at least causally foreshadowed. However, emotional texture leans on repeated abstractions (“hope,” “affectionate heart ached”) rather than sharp, embodied contradiction under pressure. The internal conflict between skepticism and belief stays mostly declarative, with few micro-choices that force a painful trade-off. Her final “becoming a believer” arrives a bit cleanly, without a distinctly dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya’s vocation and motivation are clear and consistent, and her early awakening plus unique sensitivity give her a definite, specific role. However, her interior life remains mostly functional: we’re told her drive more than we feel conflicting impulses or embodied fear in the dangerous cave. Her acceptance of the fossil’s “choosing” her happens smoothly, without much resistance or visible cost. This keeps the arc from feeling fully earned or psychologically rich.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara has a clear role and motivation, and her actions align consistently with her nature as a meticulous, solitary worker turned community guide. However, her inner life remains largely abstracted into ideas about time and wisdom, with little embodied emotion or contradiction under pressure. She faces no meaningful internal dilemma or moral friction as she decodes and shares the prophecy. The final transformation reads as serene and frictionless rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aleksandr’s interiority is specific and credible—burned spy, estranged father, and man searching for courage are well-integrated facets, especially around the pillbox and the daughter’s photo. His contradiction between exhaustion and renewed resolve plays on the page rather than being merely told. The final renunciation of his old life in favor of a reclaimed future for his daughter feels earned. A few lines drift toward generalized reflection rather than character-particular thought, slightly blunting peak sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman’s vocation, temperament, and sense of duty are clearly drawn, and his attentiveness to the environment feels particular and grounded. However, he faces no real internal conflict or dilemma; his desires and actions are aligned from start to finish. The “cost” of his endurance is mostly implied and never tests his beliefs on the page. As a result, he reads as a strong sketch rather than a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent—seeking to understand the oasis—and his actions (handling the glass, tending the earth, resolving to return) align with that aim. However, he remains almost entirely unconflicted; his “zen-minded” competence is never strained or meaningfully opposed. Emotional texture is largely implied by his calm, reverent behavior rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or missteps. The final understanding feels earned but low-cost, more contemplative than character-transforming.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation—to carry forward her grandmother’s quiet craft of bringing light into darkness—is clear and consistent, and her fire-escape gardening grounds her as a particular person rather than a type. Her emotional life, however, stays relatively smooth; there’s little on-page contradiction or genuine struggle under pressure. The late “purpose crystallized” moment is earned but not costly, reading more as affirmation than as a choice that forecloses anything. Lockmaster Jim functions more as benign guide than as a source of pressure, which keeps relational dynamics gentle rather than crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s isolation, Aethenian heritage, and reincarnated memory stream create a distinct interior life, and the repeated “brittle awakenings” give her some embodied texture. Her motivation “to translate this profound isolation into genuine independence” is clearly stated and threads through the piece. However, the internal conflict is more described than dramatized—she rarely faces concrete, pressured choices—so the final understanding feels a bit like a declared epiphany rather than one earned through visible struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motive (creative and spiritual exhaustion, desire for reconnection) is clear and coherent with her occupation and history. However, her inner life remains mostly declarative—she’s “emptier,” “searching,” a “keeper of secrets”—with limited embodied contradiction or messy ambivalence on the page. The shift from blocked to inspired comes quickly once she encounters the nest, feeling more like a clean flip than the culmination of a fraught internal struggle. The final renunciation (“she would never write another letter that didn’t contain this truth”) is emotionally legible but not dramatically costly in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s obsession and cautious hope are clearly motivated and consistent, and her professional lens (charts, frequencies) gives her some particularity. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: the risky interference feels more inevitable than agonized over, with few in-scene micro-choices showing competing impulses. Relationships (especially with Merrick and the town) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The closing shift to “preparing for the next phase” reads credible but emotionally light given the scale of what she’s done.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core contradiction—prudently adventurous yet claustrophobic—comes through clearly in both her hesitation and her decision to act anyway. Her motivation to free her people is specific and grounded in family history, and the moment when her claustrophobia “fades” before the portal feels like a real inner shift. However, most of her conflict is narrated rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure; we’re told she’s cautious more than we see her recalculating or nearly turning back. The cost of leaving (betrayal, separation) is asserted but not deeply felt through concrete, character-specific reactions at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s core traits (face-blind, methodical, art-and-analysis hybrid) are clear and consistently tied to her investigative choices, and her professionalism reads plausibly. However, she experiences almost no internal contradiction or emotional messiness under pressure; her motivation “to awaken dormant empathy” is asserted rather than dramatized. Her competence faces no meaningful test or cost, so by the confession her arc feels more like a straight line than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s motives (legacy, obsession, vindicating the ancestor) are clear and consistent, and we get some embodied anxiety (“spongey dread,” trembling fingers). Internal conflict is present but under-dramatized; they move from decoding to activation with relatively little on-page struggle or contradiction. Dr. Aris functions mainly as a legitimizing witness rather than an active source of pressure. The final choice feels plausible but could use one more beat of inner friction to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias has a clear, particular interior life—his observant nature, his brother’s rejection, and his vow to “recount this impossible journey” all feel specific and motivate his choice to ascend. However, internal contradiction is underplayed: we don’t really feel fear, grief, or reluctance alongside wonder, so the cost of leaving his world is emotionally muted. Emotions are often framed in abstract terms (“luminous disbelief,” “tapestry of redemption”) rather than deeply embodied responses. The final shift into active crossing is credible but not sharply tested against any competing impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias has a clear backstory, coherent motives (redefining his robber father’s legacy), and a consistent behavioral through-line of calm, but his inner conflict rarely sharpens into on-page contradiction. The most pressured moment with Marcus is handled largely through exposition and tidy dialogue, so we don’t see his composure strain in embodied, specific ways. His final realization about “starting point” feels thematically apt but somewhat declared rather than earned via messy micro-choices. Relationships (with Marcus, his mother, his absent father) are sketched rather than used as live crucibles forcing costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation and role are clear and consistent—she wants to decode the recurring dream inscriptions and understands they hold healing wisdom. However, she experiences almost no on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she moves calmly from discovery to collaboration to success. Her emotions skew toward summary (“motivation had never been more urgent”) rather than embodied, particularized feeling. Dr. Thorne is more a benevolent functionary than a pressure-bearing presence, so the relationship never truly becomes a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The druid’s goal and loyalty to her mentor are clear and consistent, and her “warlike serenity” gives her a coherent, if somewhat flat, emotional through-line. However, interior conflict is minimal: she never truly wavers or displays contradictory impulses, so the ordeal feels like a test of competence rather than a crucible. Her gift for finding lost things is invoked but not deeply problematized or shown with meaningful cost. The mentor’s “true nature” is revealed but not specified, so their relationship never sharpens into a morally or emotionally complex reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The visionary’s motivation is clear and consistent—restore the covenant by reaching the intersection of dreams—but their interiority is generalized and archetypal rather than particular. “Anxious elation” is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or concrete reactions. The root-bound limitation is an interesting flaw but never really produces mistakes or moral friction. The final realization comes easily, with little sense of emotional cost or resisted paths.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core traits—reckless idealism, fierce gentleness, and a self-imposed vocation of soul-mending—are clearly established and consistently motivate her choices. However, her internal conflict is mostly summarized (recklessness vs. learned patience) rather than dramatized as simultaneous, competing impulses under pressure. Emotional states skew toward conceptual (“patch holes in the soul”) rather than embodied texture. The final endurance choice (continuing her vigil) feels earned but not sharply costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus is sharply sketched—a burned-out, aging ex-roadie whose competence and shame shape every move, from his reverent handling of the cloth to the careful explanation to the foreman. His grief for his wife and career feels specific, not generic, and his small internal shift at the end is motivated by the accumulated details. However, contradictory impulses (e.g., urge to disengage vs. compulsion to care) are more stated than dramatized under pressure, so his change reads as gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and grounded in her vocation and lineage, and her cautious, methodical approach versus the lure of “haunted ambitions” creates a credible internal tension. Her emotions are mostly carried through image (the seed’s pulse, the fading spirit) rather than label. However, that contradiction never quite forces a hard, costly choice on the page; the decision to go to the Pamirs feels aligned with both caution and ambition, so no path is truly foreclosed yet.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian’s role, rituals, and internal stance toward identity shifts are clear and consistent, giving a stable sense of who they are. However, motivation beyond generalized duty and “preserving wonder” is mostly stated rather than tested, and we get few concrete, pressured micro-choices. Internal conflict about the fluctuating identity is summarized as something already accepted instead of dramatized in the moment. This keeps the character from feeling fully particular and lived-in at a publishable-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The inspector has a clear role and a coherent “before/after” motivation shift, but her inner life remains thin: we see wonder and resolve, not much fear, resistance, or contradiction. The choice to take up the crown feels almost frictionless, more like accepting destiny than wrestling with a cost. Embodied emotion is present (“trembling fingers,” “liquid sunlight”) yet often in generalized, non-idiosyncratic terms. The final mission reads as conceptually fitting but psychologically under-earned for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s guilt, professional identity, and relationship to her brother are clearly drawn and consistently motivate her choices, especially the decision to follow the graffiti into the tunnels. Her interiority is specific (rivers, tributaries, maps) rather than generic, and her final act with the accordion reads as earned. However, the emotional conflict is often summarized in abstract terms like “self-forgiveness” and “healing” rather than dramatized through messy, in-scene contradiction. The result is strong but not yet piercing or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer has a clear, consistent motivation (reach the library and decode the cipher), and their cautious, obsessive temperament feels coherent with their actions. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized, leaning on concept more than idiosyncratic emotional texture. We get little sense of contradictory impulses—risk versus fear is stated but not deeply dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The closing transformation (“the unfolding cipher had…transformed the seeker themselves”) is thematically apt but a touch told rather than fully earned through concrete internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (preserving the violin’s “dream” from the Empire) is clear, consistent, and credibly intensifies once the coffee omen lands. Her interiority is specific—mulberry ache, bone-deep fatigue, plant-voices—but internal conflict (fear vs. resolve) remains relatively understated rather than fully dramatized as a push-pull. The final choice to sacrifice the original violin to birth a hidden legacy is well-earned by prior traits (provenance mind, plant-telepathy, reverence for objects). Lack of on-page interpersonal pressure limits the relational crucible dimension, but for a single-POV piece this remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s role, skills, and core motivation (redemption via preservation after failing her sister) are clear and consistent, and her interiority fits the ritualistic mood. However, she’s rendered almost entirely as a serene, competent guardian with little on-page contradiction or struggle. Emotional stakes are told more than viscerally felt, and we never see her composure fray or her motive genuinely tested. The closure reflects endurance of her purpose, but without a sharp, costly internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s characterization as a devoted, aging caretaker with a long history of betrayal and forgiveness is coherent and specific, and her desire for “true peace” is clear. However, her internal life is more declared than dramatized—she rarely faces concrete, pressured micro-choices in the moment beyond continuing to walk forward. The forgiving of the betrayer is summarized rather than embodied, which blunts the visible cost of her current stance. The final shift to “becoming the source” of contentment feels emotionally plausible but arrives somewhat as an articulated insight rather than the culmination of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elian is sharply etched: the “conscience for hire” whose “cloak of doubt” and “protected vulnerability” govern every choice reads as a specific, credible person. His internal conflict—professional detachment vs the accumulating weight of others’ consciences—is clear and embodied in his handling of the chimes and shard. The fisherman is thin but functional as a pressure source, and the relationship dynamic (client seeking certainty vs consultant defending nuance) is legible. The closing glimpse of the cloak slipping and his belief in human complexity gives him an earned, if quiet, shift rather than a pat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elien and Maya are clearly sketched with consistent motives—he wants to teach and withhold, she wants to understand and trust—but they remain archetypal more than individuated. Elien’s backwards aging and “weaving truth carefully” are intriguing but under-explored in terms of internal contradiction or cost. Maya has a single smooth arc from confusion to insight, with little genuine resistance or competing impulse. The teacher–student dynamic works functionally but lacks the messiness and specificity that would make the climax feel more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s motivation—to understand “navigation without moving” and answer the arrowhead’s call—is clear and consistent across the piece. However, he experiences almost no genuine internal contradiction or moral friction; his emotions move in a straight line from reverent awe to fulfillment. His tears and “weathered resolve” are evocative but slightly generalized, more archetypal than deeply individuated. The final relinquishment of self is felt but not strongly dramatized as a difficult or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s dissatisfaction with automated perfection and his yearning for “the sacred in the simple” create a clear, consistent motivation that plausibly drives him to theft-adjacent rule-breaking. His interiority is specific enough—especially around the Regulation Pack and the keystone’s warmth—to feel like a real sensibility rather than a stock “special rebel.” However, his internal conflict remains underdeveloped: we’re told he’s underachieving and out of step, but we never see genuine fear, doubt, or temptation to stay safely standardized, so the turn toward wisdom feels a bit smooth. The closing “more present, not more powerful” shift is earned conceptually but lands as a tidy upgrade rather than a hard-won, ambiguous change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    Hemingway’s motivation (to understand his synesthetic gift) is clear and consistent, and his lamplighter profession threads neatly into the final vow, but he experiences little real internal conflict or visible cost. His reactions skew toward wonder more than a textured mix of fear, doubt, and desire. The librarian functions mainly as an expositor rather than an active relational crucible. The closing promise feels earned enough but not deeply wrestled with.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    Loran’s role and motivation are clear and consistent—he reveres the ritual and wants to interpret the universe’s will—but his inner life is relatively one-note. “Quiet enthusiasm” and duty largely replace any layered internal conflict, and his moment of doubt is brief and easily swept away. The relationship with Korin is thin; she adds vocalized fear but does not significantly pressure or complicate his choices. His final certainty (“I understand now”) feels more declared than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reaper’s grief, unexpected love for a mortal, and new purpose in naming fears are clear and consistent, and his final lightening of burden feels earned. His interiority is particular (“voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement”) rather than generic. However, his internal conflict is more described than dramatized in present-time choices, so we seldom see contradictory impulses actively collide. The shift from collector of souls to namer of fears could use one sharper moment of resistance or doubt to deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mage’s motivation (to fix the bell and the imbalance despite his mediocrity) is clear, consistent, and drives his choices. His “lukewarm” self-concept versus his stubborn devotion gives him a mild but coherent internal contradiction. However, his emotional life under pressure stays relatively smooth and idealized—there’s little fear, doubt, or genuine temptation to quit once he commits. The change at the end (feeling his powers “beginning to warm”) is thematically apt but comes with minimal visible cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thomas’s humane commitment and late-breaking personal connection to the town (via his aunt) give him clear, specific motivation, and his final decision grows plausibly from that. However, his inner conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene; we see little embodied doubt or resistance when he realizes his complicity. The pivot from loyal warden to activist feels a touch tidy because it isn’t tested against any counter-impulse (fear of losing his job, loyalty to the authorities, etc.). A bit more contradiction on the page would deepen him from admirable figure to fully lived character.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s goal and temperament are clear—an intensely analytical alchemist with a hidden sentimental streak—and her actions consistently align with the harmonization she seeks. However, her interiority remains relatively undisturbed by contradiction: the “secretly sentimental” trait is told and lightly shown (the token box, thoughts of her mentor) but never forces a difficult trade-off or mistake. Under pressure, she never wavers or missteps; the ritual succeeds cleanly, so we learn little about her limits or blind spots. The final sense of balance reads more as confirmation of an already-declared nature than as a hard-won internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    The watcher is clearly motivated by duty and the burden of protecting the community, and their competence under pressure feels credible. However, their interior life is largely summarized in repeated abstractions about “burden” and “trust” rather than dramatized through specific, conflicted impulses. We don’t see a sharp, lived clash between fear and duty in a concrete decision; the final choice to transmit feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The result is solid but relatively flat characterization for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s core wound (ego death, numbness) and role as vivifier are clear and consistent, and her shift toward feeling again is motivated by the on-page ordeal with the brain. However, her emotions are often told in abstract terms (“hollow, numb,” “fortress against feeling”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or contradictory impulses under pressure. The big realization that she is now “a bridge between opposites” reads a bit tidy and thematic rather than emerging from a hard, specific choice. Still, the arc from numb survivor to purposeful catalyst is legible and earned enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motive—to safeguard space for innovation—is clear and consistent, and her escape-room background gives her a distinctive lens. However, she encounters almost no genuine resistance, and we rarely see contradictory impulses or real emotional friction under pressure. The “epiphany” about the corpse flower and her creative process feels largely pre-decided rather than earned through struggle. As a result, the internal shift lands as gentle reinforcement, not a costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silas’s grief and desire to “restore lost laughter” are clear, embodied in his ritual with the blower and tunnel, and his contradictory impulses (knowing time is over yet hoping for resonance) feel credible. However, his interiority leans on repeated abstract phrases (“mournfully eager,” “unspoken sorrow”) rather than specific, character-particular memories or sensory flashbacks to Melody/children, which would deepen him beyond an archetypal mourner. The final endurance—accepting he hasn’t restored laughter, only remembered it—is emotionally plausible and earned. Still, the character never surprises us with an idiosyncratic reaction or flaw under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    The guardian’s motivation (homesickness, coping through “interiorizing exteriors,” desire to befriend uncertainty) is clear and consistent, and their final step forward is psychologically legible. However, we rarely see contradictory impulses in real-time (e.g., fear vs. desire to leave); most conflict is summarized rather than dramatized. Emotions tend to be described conceptually rather than embodied in specific sensations or behaviors. The arc from exile to multidimensional belonging is compelling but feels somewhat over-declared rather than earned through messy, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation—to break a hereditary duty of preservation through transformation—is clear and consistent, and his choices (to keep attempting, then to fully embrace destruction) track with that. However, his interiority leans on labels and abstractions (“stoically sensitive,” “hopeless alchemist”) rather than dramatized, contradictory impulses in the moment. His emotional life is more told than shown, with little concrete behavior under pressure beyond ritual performance. The final shift in self-understanding is earned conceptually but would land harder with more embodied conflict earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she reads more as an archetypal mystic-technician than as a fully individuated person with contradictions or blind spots. Her competence is never seriously challenged, so we don’t see layered or degrading emotional states under pressure. The line about “discarding assumptions” states an internal shift rather than dramatizing a conflicted decision. The result is coherent but low-friction characterization that doesn’t quite earn the weight of her final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Liam’s motivation and backstory are clear and specific—his split existences and desire to heal them ground his choices. However, his interiority remains mostly declarative (“resiliently positive”) with little embodied ambivalence or real doubt under pressure. We rarely see contradictory impulses in scene; everything points smoothly toward success. The final sense of cost (“being of three worlds”) is stated more than felt through conflicted action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s core motivation (finding his sister/understanding connection) is clear and consistent, and his final realization flows logically from that desire. However, his interiority stays generalized—“a void,” “longing,” “to unlock deeper truths”—with little concrete, contradictory emotional texture under pressure. The sister relationship is powerful conceptually but under-dramatized on the page; we learn about her mostly in exposition, so the reunion costs him little in visible struggle. As a result, the closing shift feels more like an articulated thesis than a hard‑won, messy personal change.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Kael’s motivation and professional identity are clear and consistent, and his attachment to the anchor link nicely reveals his longing for connection. However, his interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized, with few concrete, embodied reactions under pressure. We get almost no active resistance or hard choices, so his “change” arrives mainly via external validation rather than a difficult internal trade-off. The lack of visible contradictory impulses undercuts depth at a literary-fiction level.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s vocation, history with her grandmother, and protective impulse are clear and coherent, and her actions align with those motives throughout. However, her interiority leans toward summary and label (“persistently curious”) rather than deeply embodied contradiction under pressure. She seldom feels truly torn or fallible; once she senses danger, she moves in a straight moral line without visible inner conflict. The child and other figures are sketched functionally, without relational complexity that might sharpen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her brother’s disappearance and duty to the unremembered—is clear and consistent, and her small on-page choices (returning despite fear, staying through the tide window) align with it. However, her internal contradictions (claustrophobia vs. compulsion to descend, loneliness vs. devotion) are mostly stated rather than dramatized in live conflict. The line “Her claustrophobia had subsided as she worked” bypasses an opportunity for embodied struggle under pressure. The cost to her relationships and career is told in a single sentence rather than experienced in a way that would sharpen her characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator’s motivation (understanding their death and nature) is clear and consistent, and small concrete habits (porcelain shard, coffee for the others, heartbeat counting) individualize them. However, internal conflict is underdeveloped: they move from uncertainty to acceptance without much on-page struggle or contradiction. The emotional turn toward “this isn’t a curse” feels more asserted than fought for. This keeps the character from feeling fully three-dimensional at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storyteller’s lifelong motivation and quiet determination are clear and consistent, and his aging body (copper veins, wrinkled skin) gives him some embodied presence. However, there is almost no on-page internal contradiction or moral friction—he wants something noble and simply persists until he gets it. The lack of conflicting impulses under pressure keeps his emotional arc relatively flat, even if dignified. His final reaction (quiet laughter, tears) is moving but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris is sharply sketched as a once-disparaged researcher whose curiosity has shaded into reverent complicity, with specific details (the arrowhead in their pocket, the phone calls) grounding their interiority. The shift from wanting proof to accepting a role as witness is clear and character-driven, though it’s mostly told rather than dramatized through a hard on-page choice. Internal contradiction (career vindication vs. protection of the cryptids) is implied but never put under explicit pressure. The net effect is compelling but stops short of the layered, conflicted complexity that would feel fully publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elayn’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to reawaken beauty in a mechanized world—and her choices track cleanly from that drive. However, she reads more as an archetypal quester than a fully individuated person; we get little contradiction, doubt, or morally fraught hesitation. Interiority is often summarized (“motivation burned bright”) rather than dramatized through specific, idiosyncratic perception. The final change (becoming the ongoing bridge between worlds) is earned in plot terms but emotionally low-cost and psychologically simple.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to subvert the border regime by delivering hope and connection—is clear and consistent, and his respectfulness under pressure (with the guards) nicely reveals character. Interiority is present but somewhat generalized; we get less contradictory impulse (fear vs. duty, self-preservation vs. rebellion) dramatized moment-to-moment than a top-tier version would show. The woman is sketched effectively through a few gestures and her line about her daughter, but her inner conflict remains thin. His final stance as “glue” in a quiet war feels earned, though it’s articulated more in summary than via a single hard, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carpenter’s motivation and history are clear and consistent, and the internal conflict around breaking twenty years of silence is convincing. The fear/desire tension at the moment of singing works well as a crystallizing choice. However, the interiority leans archetypal and thematic rather than idiosyncratically personal—few concrete, character-specific thoughts or embodied reactions. The change at the end feels earned but emotionally smoothed, with limited sense of ongoing flaw or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Margaret’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her small physical behaviors (scarf, tracing equations) align with her inner drive. However, she lacks significant internal contradiction or moral ambiguity; her “sanely eccentric” devotion never comes under tension. The final fulfillment of her life’s purpose is emotionally legible but not deeply complicated. As a result, the character reads strong but slightly idealized rather than fully human and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief and dogged, ritualized longing come through clearly in her predawn routines and the way she handles her sister’s tools. Her motivation—to recapture a “runaway dream” and decode her sister’s last sunrises—is consistent and specific. Interiority is evocative but somewhat one-note; we don’t see much contradiction or resistance (e.g., anger at the sister, doubt about the quest). The final acceptance of her sister as light is emotionally earned, but the inner conflict leading there could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silas’s motivation and method are clear and consistent, and his vocation as a “locksmith” of minds is nicely particularized. However, his interiority remains largely archetypal—devoted, wise, selfless—without much contradictory impulse or felt cost. The woman’s characterization is almost entirely symbolic (“fierce in her intellect, trembling at the threshold of her own genius”), which limits emotional specificity. The result is effective but emotionally safe rather than deeply human.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand and reclaim her lost memories) is clear, consistent, and rooted in her folklorist background, and her small choices—returning daily, aligning charts, touching each mushroom—track with that drive. However, her internal conflict is muted: we don’t see contradictory impulses or serious doubt; once she makes the connection, she moves smoothly to recovery with little resistance. Emotions are largely summarized rather than deeply embodied, so her decades of loss feel somewhat abstract on the page. The final realization about her “chronically curious nature” lands more as a neat thesis than as the culmination of dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archivist is sharply etched: his backward walking, peripheral vigilance, and “reversible exile” give him distinctive psychology and embodied habits, and his quiet investment in Prisha pays off when he recognizes her resilience as the fulfillment of his own drive. Prisha herself is thinner but credible; her initial nervousness and later steadiness track clearly. Internal contradiction (his stubborn loyalty to principle vs. avoidance of recounting his fall) is implied rather than dramatized in live conflict, so the emotional cost of exile remains more thematic than felt. The final satisfaction leans a bit tidy—he’s gratified rather quickly—without much hint of the unresolved bitterness or lingering wound that would deepen the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The pruner’s core motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—devoted, reverent, methodical—but she faces almost no genuine internal contradiction in the moment. Her emotions are mostly summarized in elevated language (“insatiably creative,” “radiant hush”) rather than grounded in idiosyncratic, embodied feeling. The single cost—“one must sometimes give pieces of oneself”—is stated more than dramatized, so her sacrifice reads conceptual rather than viscerally felt. This yields a stable, coherent character, but not yet a fully alive, pressured one for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s characterization as a broken mask restorer who mends others (and spirits) more effectively than herself is specific and compelling, and her sensitivity to “fractures in others” tracks cleanly to her actions with the net. However, her internal conflict around her gift being a burden versus a gift is mostly told rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page. Jacob functions more as a plot vector than a fully pressured presence, though his age and long-held secret add texture. The closing micro-shift in Elena (“one tiny section of her own damage repaired”) feels earned but also a bit quick and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and worldview are clear and particular—her desire “to interpret the silence…with empathy” feels organic and drives her choices. However, she faces little on-page opposition, so we see limited contradictory impulses or real strain under pressure. Her big realization and final stance arrive smoothly, without much sense of internal struggle or cost beyond implied intellectual effort. The character is strong for this length but not yet at a level of deeply dramatized ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a “medium-historian” and her drive to understand “the physics of letting go” are clear and consistent, and her analytic temperament is shown through her methodical observations and note-taking. However, her internal life remains relatively smooth—there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle beyond a single tearful moment. The near-death backstory is intriguing but under-leveraged for on-page tension. The final understanding feels earned but emotionally low-friction for the depth of existential stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s central motivation—empathy for unspoken needs—is clearly articulated and consistent, and her backstory with a practical, emotion-suppressing family supports it. However, almost all of this is told rather than dramatized, so we rarely see her under real pressure making live, revealing choices. Internal contradiction is minimal; she more or less smoothly becomes the perfect intermediary with little friction or cost. That keeps her believable but limits depth and prevents the ending stance from feeling truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elira’s interiority is clear—curious, compassionate, observant—and her motivation to decode and then protect the captain’s secret feels consistent and grounded. The connection between her role as servant and her private affection is nicely drawn. However, her internal conflict stays relatively low-pressure; she never truly struggles between competing impulses, and the cost of her final choice is more stated than dramatized. The captain, as a figure, remains somewhat schematic—defined by sorrow and secret love but not much textured beyond that.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s motivation—vindicating her mentor and proving atmospheric memory—is clear, specific, and consistent, and it meaningfully reframes her fear into purpose by the end. Her professional lens colors perception in a character-particular way (classifying clouds by emotion), giving her a distinct interiority rather than a generic “scientist” voice. Internal conflict is present but quiet: she’s suspended between mortal danger and calm, between professional skepticism and personal conviction, though this contradiction could be sharpened further under such extreme circumstances. The final endurance/commitment to her work feels earned, but the emotional cost of remaining in peril could be more bodily and immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s perceptual quirks and compensations for face blindness feel specific and embodied, and her relationship to pattern versus facial detail is well realized. Her core motivation—completing a final project before demolition—tracks cleanly with her choices, especially the pivot from literal stars to human constellations. However, the emotional cost of losing the library and the internal conflict between clinging to her original plan versus embracing the coin’s revelation are summarized more than dramatized. The final shift reads thoughtful but relatively smooth, with little visible resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eli’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and his curiosity plausibly drives the scene. However, he faces almost no genuine resistance—internal or external—so there’s little sense of struggle or cost. Interiority remains fairly general and functional rather than vividly character-specific. The “change” at the end (from aspiring to having discovered) feels more declarative than earned through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s motivation (to master the “rhythm of repair” and fulfill his grandfather’s legacy) is clear, consistent, and carries into the climax. However, internal conflict is minimal—he rarely hesitates or struggles, so we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. His epiphany about restoration over acquisition is believable but arrives almost frictionlessly. The character feels specific but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elion’s and Aris’s motives are clear and consistent (protect the colony, trust the messages), but interiority is almost entirely summarized rather than dramatized, so we never feel their contradictions under pressure. Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” quality functions as a label rather than a dramatized trait, with no scene of doubt, pushback, or cost. Emotional beats like the community’s “hesitant curiosity” are gestured at but not embodied in concrete reactions or micro-choices. As a result, the characters feel more like vehicles for the parable than fully inhabited people.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s role, burden, and long-term motivation are clear and consistent, and his exhaustion at the end reads as a modest but real cost. However, he functions more as an archetypal caretaker than a fully individuated person, with little contradiction or specific personal history beyond his duty. Emotional texture leans on reverent awe and quiet resolve without much variance. The choice to persist feels earned but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias is clearly motivated (duty to his mother, urge to protect travelers) and his competence with the device fits his “offhandedly exact” trait. However, his inner life is summarized rather than dramatized—his shift from seeing the orchard as a prison to a blessing lands, but with limited on-page struggle or contradiction. Emotions tend toward labels (“heavy heart,” “felt at peace”) rather than specific embodied conflict. The final acceptance of his role feels earned but too easy for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—her profession, argument with her sister, and grief all coherently drive her choices, especially the phone call and the new research focus. The polymer/music lens gives her a distinct way of thinking, though the emotional conflict often resolves a bit too smoothly and cleanly. Contradictory impulses (career vs family, grief vs curiosity) are present but not deeply dramatized in scene; they’re more narrated as realizations. The sister’s side is sketched but relatively frictionless, softening the sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vendor’s motives (parole terms, desire to open the shop, quest to find where stories begin) are clear and coherent, and the final realization grows plausibly from them. However, interiority remains largely declarative; we’re told insights (“finally understanding…”) more than we see conflicting impulses dramatized under pressure. Emotional embodiment is minimal, with little sense of bodily stress or contradiction as they handle dangerous shards or contemplate their limited freedom. The result is a solid but not deeply textured interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s vocation, gift, and long-term cost are clear and character-specific, and his motivation to “sandpaper” remorse is coherent and distinctive. However, his internal conflict in the pavilion is summarized rather than dramatized—there’s little sense of moment-to-moment wavering or contradictory impulses under active pressure. The danger of being overwhelmed by others’ regrets is told in concept but never quite felt as a live on-page struggle. The closing sense of lightness is earned enough, but the emotional price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena’s core motivation—to heal the rift between farmers and townsfolk—is clear and consistently aligned with her actions. However, she is rendered as almost entirely admirable, with little flaw, ambiguity, or internal contradiction under pressure. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied, so we rarely feel her stakes in a visceral way. The ending change in her role (librarian to “bridge builder”) is credible but comes without visible cost or real struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The engineer’s motivation is clear and consistent—months of work to access “entangled memories” and become an “archaeologist of abandoned dreams”—and their inner experience is present throughout. However, they rarely experience genuine inner contradiction or hesitation; their awe and purpose dominate with little conflicting impulse (fear, doubt, revulsion) under pressure. The transformation is more an intended outcome than a hard-won, risky choice. This keeps the arc from feeling as psychologically rich as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elara’s motivation as a dutiful, visionary archivist is clear and consistent, and her actions track cleanly with her goal of renewing the protections. However, her interiority leans on abstractions (“latent blaze,” “genuine desire”) rather than concrete, character-specific contradictions under pressure. We rarely see competing impulses or real doubt; she moves from competence to success with minimal internal friction. The cost she feels at the end—renewed responsibility—is asserted more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, history with Master Kaelen, and burning drive to restore music are clear and specific, and her embodied responses while reading the sculpture’s emotions feel credible. However, she faces no real internal contradiction or live alternative path; her motivation never wavers or complicates, so the closure choice to “begin the work of redemption anew” feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The piece therefore offers a strong portrait rather than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (seeking understanding/beauty rather than status) is clear and consistent, and his exile is meaningfully tied to his flaw (arrogance). Interiority is present but somewhat generalized; we don’t see many sharply contradictory impulses on the page, only a gentle wavering of resolve. The final stance shift to acceptance is earned but comes with relatively little messy struggle. Still, the character feels specific rather than stock, especially in how chess informs his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to validate and extend her life’s work on empathy/frequencies) is clear and consistent, and her final shift from “cataloging silence” to “teaching others” is credibly grounded. However, her interiority skews declarative and assured (“Empathy is the bridge between frequencies…”) with little on-page contradiction or felt risk, so her change carries limited emotional cost. Emotions are present but mostly in summary rather than embodied conflict; she never truly doubts herself or struggles under pressure. The result is a strong but relatively low-friction character portrait rather than a crucible-tested arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s ambition, sensory gift, and lineage are clear and consistent, and her choices (climbing higher than others, sustaining the vigil, committing to the seed as teacher) track with those traits. However, her interiority skews idealized and smooth—there’s very little real struggle, fear, or contradiction on the page. The “serenity within motion” is mostly described rather than earned through conflicted impulses under pressure. Her final transformation feels conceptually appropriate but not heavily paid for emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Arion’s motivation (discovering the source of resilience) is clear and consistent with his competence as a pilot. However, his interiority is fairly generic and conflict-free, with little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine fear under extreme conditions. Emotional reactions are often summarized rather than embodied, and his final realization arrives without visible psychological struggle. The ending change is more informational than character-driven, with minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elena is clearly sketched as a seasoned, methodical investigator with a strong professional ethos, and her motivation to understand "singular convergence" is consistent. However, she faces little on-page opposition and almost no internal contradiction; her competence is never meaningfully strained. Emotional states are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and the flight engineer’s patch never quite opens into deeper, specific feeling. The ending yields more of a continued professional stance than a costly personal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    Eira’s role and overarching motive (“to certify wonder as essential”) are clear, but her interior life is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, with little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. She never seriously doubts, fails, or reconsiders, so we don’t see values tested in action. Emotions lean on abstract phrasing (“responsibility felt heavier than the frozen walls”) rather than specific, individuated reactions. The ending offers completion but not a felt personal cost or reconfiguration of self.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eldrin’s motivation and inner life are clear and specific—guilt, pride, and the desire for redemption all read distinctly, and his ritual is a credible outgrowth of his temperament as a “driven relic keeper.” The choice to subject himself to this demanding process, and the way his embodied reactions (trembling hands, tears) track the experience, feel earned. The main weakness is that his internal conflict is articulated more as a smooth arc toward insight than as messy, contradictory impulses in the moment, so the transformation verges on tidy. Still, the before/after in self-conception is legible and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is sharply drawn as an obsessive, ethically indifferent researcher, and her methods and choices are consistent with that through-line. However, we rarely see genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure; she moves from plan to execution to analysis with little emotional disruption. Thomas functions more as a test subject than a fully realized counterforce, so the relationship pressure is limited. The final recommitment to her project feels earned but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ayla’s role and motivations are clear and consistent—the jittery but competent courier entrusted with a powerful object—yet her internal conflict remains underdeveloped. Her attachment to the pendant and the cost of surrendering it are asserted but not deeply dramatized; she gives it up with little visible struggle. The strongest characterization appears in the early interaction with the old woman, where her nervousness and receptivity to wonder come through behavior. The closing shift from “jittery” to confident works conceptually but feels somewhat smoothed over emotionally.

    Elara’s core traits—skeptical, disciplined, yet mystically inclined—are clear and consistently tied to her choices, especially her insistence on proof before accepting the prism’s revelations. Her long-term costs (lost relationships, credibility) are stated, giving some weight to her drive. However, internal conflict in the scene itself is muted: her doubt wavers only briefly and the breakthrough comes with little resistance or messy emotion. The final “quest had been too small” realization feels slightly tidy rather than hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s goal—to obey her grandmother and carry the message when silence completes—is clear and consistent, and her small choices (setting out, accepting each sacrifice) track logically. However, her interiority remains generalized and archetypal; we rarely feel a specific, embodied struggle when she gives up memories or when the bead dims. The “wistful loom spinner” idea is strong but underdeveloped in terms of tangible habits, flaws, or contradictions. Her final transformation into a weaver of sound is thematically apt but feels more asserted than psychologically earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orion’s core traits—meek, overlooked, quietly resolute—are clear and consistent, and his choice to accept the silk grows credibly from them. His hesitation at the bargain hints at internal conflict, but it resolves quickly and without much embodied tension. After the awakening, he moves from uncertainty to purpose with almost no visible struggle or misstep, which flattens his arc. The final stance (“no longer meek in spirit”) is earned in outline, but lacks a felt cost or messy ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    The sensory map maker has a clear profession and motivation but remains mostly an abstract consciousness—few embodied emotions or contradictions under pressure. Curiosity and determination are stated rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices. The strongest moment is the refusal/limitation at the red shard, but we don’t feel an internal tug-of-war there. The final renewed determination lands, but without a visible cost beyond temporary frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elias is sharply rendered as a competent, solitary professional whose reticence feels earned and particular, not generic, and his interiority is grounded in what he notices rather than what he declares. His shift—from self-contained isolation to accepting membership in the anonymous chain—is legible and motivated by the discoveries in the lantern room. The change is quiet but credible: he takes concrete actions (restacking stones, writing his letter, returning the sea glass) that reconfigure his sense of self. What’s missing at this tier is more overt friction or contradiction in him under pressure—his acceptance comes almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, competence, and sense of responsibility are clear and particular, and the “shadowed elation” state reads as a credible blend of joy and burden. Her motivation to guide post-collapse migrants is strong and consistent, and her micro-choices (modifying beams, choosing to reveal a hidden channel) align with that. Internal conflict around her newfound prophecy is sketched but not really dramatized under direct pressure—she never faces a moment where speaking or staying silent carries immediate, visible cost. The ending choice feels like a reaffirmation rather than a deepened or transformed stance, which keeps this out of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to understand why some people attract stories—is clear and consistently enacted through his observational routines and experiments. His donor heart and altered perception add specificity and a mild internal tension (“I am becoming what I seek”), though that contradiction never sharpens into a real dilemma or costly choice. Emotional life is largely conceptual rather than embodied, so his breakthrough feels intellectually earned but not deeply felt. The final stance (iridescent caution in his own storytelling) is coherent but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Samuel’s motives (maintaining the labyrinth, understanding trees’ witness) are clear and consistent, and his professional competence is well-evoked through concrete details like rerouting steam pipes and cataloging dreams. However, his internal conflict is minimal: there’s little sense of competing impulses or real doubt, so the climactic understanding arrives as a gift rather than something wrestled from resistance. His emotions are mostly summarized (“a weariness he hadn’t acknowledged”) rather than deeply embodied in the moment. The final shift in his purpose is credible but feels more bestowed than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    The keeper’s motivation (rekindling the realm) is clear and consistent, and their actions align with that goal. However, they feel more like an archetype than an individual; interiority is abstract and role-driven rather than concretely embodied. There’s little sense of contradictory impulses or specific emotional texture under pressure. The final rest reads as conceptually earned but not deeply personalized in felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s core contradiction (compassionate yet reclusive) is clear and consistently motivates her actions, and the “staying while leaving” tactic is a credible coping strategy. However, emotion is often summarized in abstract terms (“keenly empathetic nature,” “enlarged tranquility”) rather than embodied in specific sensations or behaviors. The final realization feels tidy and somewhat pre-digested instead of arising through a sequence of pressured, messy internal beats. Still, the throughline from invitation → avoidance → framed refusal is coherent and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliza’s perception-driven personality and sensitivity to “lost things” are specific and consistent, and her motivation to understand the vanished bakery tracks cleanly into the final absolution beat. However, her guilt over not speaking up earlier is introduced late and mostly told rather than built through earlier contradiction on the page, so the internal conflict feels slightly underprepared. The emotional shift at the end is credible but a bit too tidy for the level of introspective complexity implied.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elias’s motivation—to preserve the vows and “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”—is clear and consistent, and his meticulous temperament pairs well with his role. However, he’s largely without contradiction or flaw on the page, so we don’t see genuine internal conflict or any costly misjudgment. His emotional life is inferred rather than embodied; the “surge of hope” is told more than dramatized. The ending choice to begin a “new phase” feels aligned with prior traits but not meaningfully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliza’s motive—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is clear, distinctive, and consistently drives her choices, and her competence as a moonshine runner’s daughter feels earned. We see micro-choices under pressure in the false starts and adjustments. However, her inner conflict remains comparatively muted; there’s little evidence of contradictory impulses or real doubt about the cost of what she’s doing. Secondary characters are functional silhouettes rather than pressures that reveal deeper facets of her.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The luminous skeptic is strongly sketched, with a clear inner tension between scientific skepticism and embodied, almost mystical perception. Their research motive and inherited ring tie neatly into the final choice to accept the storm. However, the emotional cost of that acceptance is asserted more than dramatized, so the transformation feels a bit too smooth. The storm man remains more archetype than character, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rhodes’s grief, creative blockage, and perfectionist wounding are clear and motivating, and his return to the cave plus decision to repaint Cora feel earned. The blessing/curse of his memory adds specificity, but internal conflict stays mostly conceptual instead of embodied in contradictory impulses in scene. His final shift—from haunted to at-home in his calling—tracks logically with prior setup. The absence of another on-page character keeps relational pressure low, slightly flattening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s core motive (to recover lost conversations, especially with her departed love) is clear and consistent, and her profession usefully reflects her value for truth. However, her lie-wilting trait and social losses are told rather than put under present-tense pressure, so internal conflict feels conceptual rather than actively dramatized. The final decision to leave at dawn is emotionally plausible but arrives more as essayed realization than as a contested, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s core desires and values (devotion to harmony, seeing muteness as gift, need to preserve wonder) are clear and consistent, and her vocation feels specific. However, interiority is mostly summarized rather than dramatized, with few embodied emotional beats or concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her seasonal muteness and heightened perception are compelling traits but remain largely conceptual. The final “choice” (lifelong devotion culminating in death) is asserted rather than felt as a moment of live, conflicting impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unit 734’s core motivations—protecting the roses/children and resolving its “inner static”—are clear and consistent, and the final self-sacrificial fragmentation is well motivated. The machine/organic contradiction is stated and then paid off in the rooted miniatures, giving a credible internal arc. However, the interiority leans on labels (“nostalgia,” “inner static”) rather than fully embodied, character-specific feeling, which keeps the emotional change somewhat abstract. There’s little sense of degraded cognition under stress or truly conflicted impulses at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo’s basic motivation (curiosity, then a desire to reconnect the community) is clear and consistent, and his choices do move the story. However, interiority is thin and generalized—he rarely feels like a specific, flawed person under pressure, and his “decision to prove that listening heals” reads as thesis rather than organic conflict. Secondary figures mostly function as exposition dispensers with minimal individuality. The final stance shift (from ownership to communal belonging) is gentle and thematically apt but low-cost and under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara has a clear role and skillset, and her motivation—turning vulnerability into strength—is stated, but her interiority remains mostly declarative rather than conflicted. She encounters little genuine resistance; there’s no moment where contradictory impulses actively tear at her. Her competence is high but largely untested, so we see less of her under true pressure. The result is a coherent but somewhat idealized protagonist without much edge or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s core motivation (finding where erased memories go, especially her brother’s) is vivid and consistent, and her small embodied beats (trembling hands, tears) make her feel particular rather than generic. Her choices—using the flowers, digging despite resistance, then re-burying the crystal—track cleanly with that motive. What’s missing at a top tier is sharper contradiction under pressure: her internal conflict stays relatively soft, with little real struggle between competing impulses on the page. The final acceptance/renunciation (she cannot free the memories) is emotionally right but could land with more visibly dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.9)
    The summoner’s core motivation is clear and consistent, but his interior life remains abstract, with little contradiction or embodied emotion beyond “quiet intensity” and “relief.” Almost every beat reiterates serenity and focus rather than showing strain, doubt, or competing impulses. His final relief feels earned in a basic sense, yet the path there doesn’t expose new facets of his character or force a visible trade-off. As a result, he reads more as a ritual functionary than a fully realized person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s desire to understand buildings and her sense of “mysterious familiarity” give her a clear spine, and Mr. Abernathy’s gentle, slightly enigmatic mentorship feels consistent. However, interior conflict is minimal; she accepts each new revelation with little hesitation or evident ambivalence. The late genealogical reveal (“Your family, too, once listened to them”) lands smoothly but without much felt cost or resistance, which keeps the emotional arc from deepening into something sharper or messier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to confront quarantined memories and understand her father) is clear and consistent, and her shift from “charmed skeptic” to committed archivist reads as a genuine change. The internal conflict between rationalism and enchantment is present but rarely forces a hard, costly choice—she moves toward the ritual without much resistance. Emotions are sometimes rendered in abstract, elevated terms (“tragically radiant,” “burden of containing what others could not bear to see”) rather than in concrete, embodied specifics. The final acceptance of her role feels earned but a bit too smooth, with limited sense of risk or genuine possibility of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s guilt, history as a forger, and bond to his family name give him clear motivation, and the choice to confess and amend the decree grows credibly from that. However, the internal conflict is mostly summarized (“he needed to forgive the unfinished business of his betrayal”) rather than dramatized in scene, so the climactic decision feels relatively unresisted. His emotions skew abstract—“weight of decades,” “chains of guilt”—with limited embodied texture. The change at the end (leaving the sanctuary to return home) is earned but emotionally smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The echo singer’s core motivation and quiet internal conflict (duty vs curiosity vs compassion) are clear and consistent, and her final shift in purpose feels earned. However, emotions are often summarized in abstract phrases (“Her deepest motivation…,” “reed-blown melancholy of her existence”) rather than embodied in concrete reactions under pressure. The child remains entirely off-page, so her relational and ethical struggle never gets a crucible scene to deepen nuance. As a result, the closing understanding is credible but not as textured or costly as it could be at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s central motivation (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage of tragedy”) is clear and consistent, and her role as a mediator between worlds is conceptually strong. However, her interiority stays generalized; we rarely see specific, embodied feelings or contradictions under pressure. She moves smoothly from goal to success with little dramatized struggle or ambivalence, which flattens her arc. The captain’s brief appearance at the end is touching but too thinly sketched to add much character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The net-mender philosopher is coherent, specific, and his vocation and rituals feel organically tied to his worldview. His motivation—to perceive and honor hidden effort—is clear and consistently dramatized in his choices (moon-path pilgrimage, tea, net-mending). However, interior conflict is essentially absent; he is serenely aligned with his beliefs, so there’s little tension or cost in his stance. The resulting arc is more a portrait of constancy than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s professional identity, skepticism, and determination are clear and consistent, and her final choice to become a “keeper” of the truth is logically motivated. However, her inner life is largely conveyed in summary rather than embodied, scene-level feeling, and we rarely see contradictory impulses working simultaneously on the page. The danger she faces is stated but not deeply felt, so the cost of her choice lands conceptually more than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias is clearly motivated—his allegiance to signals over nations or gods is distinct, and his patience and solitude feel consistent. However, his internal conflict is underplayed; he never seems genuinely torn between obscurity and direct influence, even once the surface prophet appears. Most emotional beats are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so we see little moment-by-moment strain or contradiction. The final “choice” to remain translator reads more like a static trait than an earned, costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet is distinct and motivated, with clear vocation and ethos (“translator between generations”), and his method of capturing sounds gives him specificity beyond a stock drifter. However, his interiority is largely monolithic—gentle, wistful, and altruistic—with little contradiction or self-interest under pressure. The decision to intervene at the senior center comes easily, without visible doubt, fear, or cost. Secondary figures (elderly residents, children) remain an undifferentiated backdrop rather than a crucible that tests him.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s motivation (protecting the artifact and living up to familial duty) is clear and consistently drives his choices, and his engineer mindset usefully colors perception and tactics. Internal conflict—“panic warred with the strict logic”—is gestured at but not deeply dramatized beyond that initial statement. The final endurance/renewed commitment beat (“promising to fulfill his duty… forever changed”) is earned but slightly told rather than shown via a sharper moral or emotional tradeoff. No other character appears on-page to pressure him directly, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mapper’s motivation—engineering a “patient revolution” through celestial observation—is clear and consistent, but largely conceptual rather than embodied. Interiority tends to be thesis-driven (“sculpting patience from impatience”) rather than character-particular, so the mapper reads more as archetype than individual. There’s little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page; they are serenely competent and unopposed. The closing satisfaction (“knowing that patience…would stand as humanity’s greatest achievement”) lands, but with no visible personal cost or internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Maya’s profession, competence, and personal history with the lantern give her a clear, particular interior life, and her final decision to risk her career for the truth is well motivated by what we’ve seen. However, her conflict between fear and courage is more told than dramatized—her “fortified vulnerability” rarely produces specific, pressured micro-choices or visible mistakes. Emotional language sometimes leans abstract (“controlling influence,” “quiet rebellion”) instead of embodied reaction in the key beats. The closing shift to “something stronger, more like courage” feels a bit tidy relative to the complexity implied earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Father Michael’s motives (guilt, duty, money anxiety, need to honor the inmate’s last request) are clear and cohere well with his choices, especially the refusal to repair the heart. His interiority is specific (“none of whom had ever returned to thank him,” his fixation on the cost) and the final stance feels earned. However, we rarely see him pulled strongly in two directions in real time; much of the conflict is explained rather than dramatized in embodied beats. Ms. Eleanor is credible but functions mainly as a thematic mirror and facilitator rather than a fully pressured character.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.0)
    The glider has a clear, consistent drive (curiosity, “yearning algorithm”) and its actions track logically from those traits, but interiority stays conceptual and emotionally cool. There’s almost no contradictory impulse or visible cost to its choices; it never hesitates or pays a price. The “evolution” is asserted more than dramatized. The moment of ringing the bell feels significant but not fully earned as a hard-won personal change.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation (solving the cold case via deleted files) is clear and consistent, and her professional role gives her plausible competence. However, her interiority leans on generalized formulations (“brightly attentive,” “forbidden knowledge”) rather than sharply individuated thought or contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivotal choice to risk her career/freedom reads emotionally thin—there’s little felt hesitation or conflict before she lies and hacks access. The ending positions her as a determined crusader, but the cost is asserted more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elena’s core traits—empathic, shadow-attuned, a respected but anomalous peacekeeper—are clear and consistent, and her goal is well-motivated. However, she encounters almost no real friction or internal contradiction; her competence goes largely unchallenged. The elders and community are abstract pressures rather than embodied relationships, so we don’t see her values tested interpersonally. The ending shift to quiet confidence is earned but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elena’s core motivation (coming as a euthanasia tourist yet drawn to disaster relief) is clear and consistent, and her final decision to stay grows plausibly from her accumulated reflections. However, her “loose grip on reality” and suicidal intent rarely manifest as embodied, contradictory impulses in scene; they remain mostly stated rather than dramatized. The emotional shift toward life feels a bit frictionless, with limited sense of cost beyond a few frozen tears and abstract realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sentinel’s core traits—gentle, observant, wounded by a past love—are coherent and stable, and his motivation to find meaning through connection is clear. However, most of this is delivered in abstract exposition rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict (loneliness vs. vocation, regret vs. acceptance) is present but rarely embodied in concrete behavior beyond fingering the letter. The final reframing of his role feels plausible but not hard-earned because we’ve watched him think, not struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The line walker’s motivation (preserving wisdom’s echo) is clear and consistent, and the admission of isolation as a cost gives a hint of depth. However, interiority stays generalized—this feels more like an archetype than a person, with little concrete, embodied emotion. The “strangely honest” trait is told more than dramatized, and internal contradiction under pressure is minimal. The final renewed purpose reads earned enough for this scale, but with modest emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara is clearly defined—calm, earnest, ritual-focused—and her vocation and worldview are consistent throughout. However, her interiority stays generalized and serene, with little evidence of contradictory impulses or genuine strain as she prepares for a high-stakes gathering of traumatized people. The survivors remain a faceless collective with no individuated pressure on her. The final “knowing” that her work is worthwhile feels emotionally untested, as nothing on the page threatens that belief.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scholar’s reverence, loneliness, and quiet obsession are sharply drawn, and details like “weathered innocence clung to him like the scent of old paper” feel character-specific. His motivation to understand and preserve language is clear and consistent throughout. Internal tension between preservation and acceptance of transformation is implied but not really dramatized as a difficult choice in-scene, so the final shift in framing doesn’t quite feel like it costs him anything. Overall, this is strong, textured characterization but falls short of an earned, conflicted turn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prophet’s motivation is clear and particular—his hunger for an abstract “sound of growing older” feels character-specific, and the precognitive forgetfulness gives him a built-in tension between seeking and losing. However, his internal conflict rarely sharpens into live contradiction on the page; he “wants to turn away” only once, and that resistance isn’t really dramatized in action. The caretaker functions more as a gentle expositor than as a pressure source. The closing acceptance reads earned but emotionally modest rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are clear and grounded in her profession and long-term ache to “be closer” to what she observes. Her choice to ignore the stabilization-matrix approach and pursue resonance instead is character-rooted and drives the story. However, she faces little credible inner conflict or visible cost; her insight arrives with relatively little struggle on the page. Emotional states skew toward abstract description rather than contradictory, embodied impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is distinct—a serene, professionally composed music therapist whose actions consistently serve the patients’ and family’s needs. Mr. Anders, his wife, and his son feel real despite minimal lines, especially in the son’s “I’ll fix it, Dad” moment. However, the therapist’s interiority is almost entirely composed and reflective; we get little contradictory impulse or visible cost to her decisively kind stance. This keeps the emotional palette slightly flatter than the situation would justify, holding the piece below top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s core motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her actions align well with her stated goal (“I must relearn what was lost”). However, she faces little genuine resistance or dilemma, so we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal struggle under pressure. The transformation at the end (curiosity expanding into a broader quest to understand reality) is conceptually sound but feels lightly earned because success comes too smoothly. Emotional embodiment tends toward generalized awe and determination rather than deeply particularized texture.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s blend of skepticism, inherited healing craft, and quiet grief over the “too perfect” Arthur creates a distinctive, consistent psychology. Her motivation to retrieve the authentic boy is clear, but her internal conflict is underplayed—she yields to wonder with little visible fear or resistance, which softens the cost of her shift. The relationship dynamic with Arthur (the echo of “My Ellie”) is poignant, yet their reunion lacks a hard choice or sacrifice in the moment. Overall, the characters feel specific and alive, but their contradictions don’t fully bite under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—earthbound yet star-obsessed, seeking fireless illumination—is clear, specific, and consistently carried from opening to ending. Her illness and lost dream give her a credible emotional foundation, and the craft inherited from her grandmother personalizes her. However, internal conflict is relatively mild and mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so contradictory impulses never truly grind against each other. The final acceptance of her earthbound state feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s motives (guilt, legacy, integrity) are clear and consistently tied to concrete choices like creating the spiral method and sacrificing the pendant. Her interiority is specific and grounded in the space, but her emotional arc is fairly linear, with little real contradiction or backsliding under pressure. Phrases like “protected vulnerability” and “stages of grief and acceptance” edge toward diagnostic/essayistic rather than embodied conflict. The final renunciation of the pendant is motivated and carries cost, but it feels more serene than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interior life and motivation (artistic integrity vs commercial pressure, collecting others’ hopes) are clear and coherent, with a credible long-term struggle. However, emotion is largely abstracted rather than embodied; we rarely feel his fear, shame, or exhilaration in concrete physical terms. The final peace arrives as a clean realization more than as a hard-won, on-page conflict between impulses. This keeps the arc persuasive but a bit too tidy for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and rooted in her particular blend of whimsy and reverence for ancestral practices, and her tinkering informs her tactics in a concrete way. However, she faces almost no meaningful resistance—internal or external—so we see little in the way of contradiction, moral friction, or pressured micro-choices. Her emotional life is largely summarized (“heart ached with a sudden, clear purpose”) rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. The result is a sympathetic but somewhat idealized protagonist who reads more as an archetype than as a fully complicated individual.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist’s motivation (translate heartbeats into maps to save humanity from darkness) is clear but largely told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. Interiority stays archetypal and serene; we rarely feel fear, doubt, or competing impulses despite the stated stakes. Actions align with the stated purpose, yet the character remains more emblematic than individuated. The final success does not visibly cost the alchemist anything beyond effort and concentration.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—the locksmith’s mindset maps nicely onto her problem-solving—but she faces little meaningful internal conflict or contradiction. Her competence is never seriously challenged, so we see more steady patience than pressured choice. The memory of her father and mentor add texture but not real tension. The final acceptance of her role as “reflective locksmith” feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The weaver’s motivation (duty to collect burdens, ambivalence about being “boundary-lessly trapped”) is clear and consistent, and the decision to include their own burden is a credible, charged micro-choice. Interiority is specific to their vocation, though often rendered in conceptual rather than bodily terms, which keeps some emotions a bit distant. The internal conflict between entrapment and connection culminates in the final reframing. The cost of their role is present but could be more viscerally embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clara’s interiority is specific and embodied—tools, grain, kettle, and rain all filter through her particular way of living with grief. Her motivation to transmute loss into carving is clear and consistently dramatized in micro-choices (deciding the lion, continuing the menagerie, accepting “here and gone”). There is a mild tendency to state her stance in abstract terms (“harvest lessons from loss”) rather than letting every insight emerge purely from action. Still, her final endurance choice—to go on marking time and memory this way—feels earned and carries a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Cyrus’s longing, regret, and doggedness are clear and consistent, and the scavenger detail plus his bent back give him some lived-in specificity. However, his internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized—he is “ready to negotiate” almost as a switch, without much on-page struggle or contradictory impulse in the scene itself. The relationship with his ghost is sketched in conceptually but doesn’t fully develop as a pressurized, specific dynamic. The final shift toward possible forgiveness feels earned enough but could land harder with more granular emotional friction between the two.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s motivation (staying behind to revive the terminal and find “equations for hope”) is clear and consistent, and her competence feels grounded in her engineering background. However, her interiority leans abstract (“stoic determination,” “functionally creative mind”) with little embodied emotional contradiction or real on-page cost. She reads as idealized and almost frictionless under pressure, which softens the impact of her final realization. The closure choice is motivated but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s motivation and regret are clear and consistent, and his occupation meaningfully colors his perceptions. The internal arc from abandonment to renewed commitment is legible and causally grounded in his experience at the sanctuary. However, his conflict is relatively straightforward, with limited contradictory impulses or genuine resistance at the moment of change, making the epiphany feel a bit easy. The bear’s “relationship” role remains more symbolic than pressuring, so we see little relational crucible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motivation (continuing her grandfather’s mission and seeking buried truth) is clear and consistent, and her doubt about being “equipped” adds some nuance. However, her emotional life stays largely in the register of abstract reflection rather than embodied, scene-bound conflict. There are few contradictory impulses dramatized in the moment—she never seriously hesitates over reading, keeping, or acting on the journal. The closing commitment to “train others” feels somewhat declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The seed collector’s patience and reverence for knowledge are clear, and the fisherman has a legible, wary-to-softening arc, but there’s little internal contradiction or real strain. His motivation is stated rather than pressure-tested, and he never faces a meaningful dilemma—only endurance. The “infinitely patient” trait governs his behavior, yet without visible emotional cost or competing impulse (frustration, doubt, urgency), his interiority stays somewhat flat. This limits the impact of his closing “understanding,” which feels more like confirmation than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The traveler’s interiority is rich and particular, with the palace thread, the war, and his guilt over “explained absences” giving him specificity beyond stock melancholy. His emotional state is mostly shown through sensory perception of the garden and the thread, not just labels. The internal shift from writing others’ obituaries to beginning his own is motivated and legible, though somewhat tidy. There could be a bit more simultaneity of contradictory impulses on the page at the moment he turns inward.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elorian’s core motivation—to restore beauty to a mechanized world—is clear and consistently enacted through his choice to risk the egg and build the device. We get some embodied emotion (his bedraggled state, falling to his knees), but much of his interiority leans on abstract reflection rather than sharply particular, contradictory impulses in the moment. The closing determination to dismantle society grows plausibly from his failure, giving an earned internal shift with visible cost implied. More textured irrationality or ambivalence under pressure would be needed for top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s paradoxical identity (arsonist’s daughter / firefighter) and her plant-grafting project give her a strong, specific motivation and interior texture. Her choices under pressure—staying with the roses, descending to the lagoon afterward—align cleanly with her values. However, her internal conflict about her father and legacy is mostly stated rather than dramatized in messy, in-scene contradiction, and she reads almost too composed and competent. The “scars can sing” belief feels fully integrated but a bit too cleanly resolved for peak literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motive (finding and freeing the stained glass box’s memories) is clear and consistent, and her traits—“luminous skepticism,” “realistically imaginative,” and “sidereal patience”—cohere into a distinct worldview. However, she rarely experiences genuine internal contradiction under pressure; skepticism “warring with hope” is gestured at but not dramatized into a hard choice. Her success feels relatively unopposed, so we don’t see flaws or blind spots meaningfully complicating her path. The final transformation into Memory Keeper lands, but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sentimentalist’s core motive—“to share light without using fire”—is clear and consistent, and its actions align with that goal. However, interiority stays abstract and mission-focused, with little sense of contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. There’s no real internal conflict or visible cost to its choices beyond a generalized “troubling serenity.” The character reads more as an archetypal function than a fully particularized consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias is specific—a gravestone carver in a greenhouse with a spectral mentor—and his grief-work motivation is clear and consistent. However, his inner life stays relatively smooth; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or genuinely pressured choice, just deepened determination. The shift from student to master (mentor’s work through him complete) is earned but emotionally underplayed on the page. Relationships (family, mentor) are mostly thematic rather than dramatized as crucibles forcing hard decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric’s guilt, diligence, and shift from solitary precision to communal humility are clear and credibly rooted in his past failure, and his choice to ask for help is well motivated. However, his inner conflict remains relatively tidy and linear, with little on-page resistance or regression once the inscriptions “explain” his error. The townspeople, including the critic-turned-helper, function more as a benevolent chorus than as individuated pressures, which limits relational complexity. The emotional register leans toward declarative realization instead of dramatized contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elias’s vocation, habits, and gentle curiosity are clearly established, and his motivation to decode the tapestry grows logically from his work in the cemetery. However, he experiences very little genuine internal conflict: his blitheness is stated but never really strained, and the revelation of sacrifice doesn’t force a difficult choice so much as a quiet reframe. The small decision to keep the truth guarded is believable but low-cost. He reads as specific and consistent, but not yet deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara’s core motive—to protect and guide the villagers through her maps—is clear and consistent, and her professional identity feels specific rather than generic “seer.” However, she experiences almost no on-page internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she simply proceeds to do what she already intended. Emotions are largely abstracted (“groundedly imaginative,” “quiet determination”) rather than embodied in concrete sensation or behavior. The ending shows continuity of purpose more than any meaningful change or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The copyist’s core motivation (restoring stories, “to teach dust to tell stories”) is vivid and consistent, and her professional role ties cleanly into her secret work. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradiction; we’re told the danger, but her emotional struggle with that risk is largely summarized. Her internal life is more mission- than person-centered, so she feels a bit emblematic. The ending offers endurance rather than change, with the cost of that stance only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elena’s vocation, history with the gallery, and fixation on safety give her a coherent, particular interiority, but most of it is delivered as exposition rather than dramatized through pressured choices. Her emotional state is clear—“sorrow and determination”—yet we rarely see contradictory impulses clash in the moment. The final realization about safety vs. process is thematically apt but feels more like a stated insight than the culmination of escalating, on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.6)
    Milo’s core motive (preserving forbidden knowledge) is clear and consistent, and his “abrasive calm” comes through in how he mutters rather than rages. However, his “agonizing” remains mostly told rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses under pressure, so the internal conflict feels conceptual more than lived. Actions (cataloging, pocketing the cog, returning to his sanctuary) align with motive but are low-stakes micro-choices rather than difficult tradeoffs. The ending stance is credible Earned Stasis, but the cost of that stance isn’t concretely embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    Eleanor’s central desire and long-term commitment are clear and consistent, and the rosette offers a tangible anchor for her motivation. However, most of her development is summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely see her make difficult micro-choices under real pressure. The “expectantly resigned” versus hopeful determination shift is told to us late instead of earned through embodied scene work. Secondary characters (students, visitor, successor) remain largely faceless, providing little relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias’s core motive and temperament are clear, and details like talking to tomato plants and recalling his family’s meals individualize him. However, his gift remains more described than dramatized, and we rarely see genuine internal contradiction or cost beyond generalized burden. His key choice—planting the seed tonight—feels ideologically motivated but emotionally under-pressured. The piece would benefit from one sharp, conflicted moment where his rebellion actually threatens something concrete he values.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s core traits—candid, duty-bound, and involuntarily honest—are clear and consistently motivate her choices, especially in granting access and reframing the supervisor’s actions. Her stated motivation “to preserve wonder in routine” threads through early and late beats. However, her internal conflict is underplayed: the tension between duty, secrecy, and compulsion to tell the truth is mostly asserted rather than deeply dramatized in embodied moments. The supervisor and the couple function more as idea-carriers than fully realized individuals, flattening the relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Aria’s sensitivity to “when things went slowly wrong” and her compulsion to walk the town collecting objects create a clear, consistent motive that feels organic to her worldview. The interiority is particular enough—her noticing “houses breathed with life” and using objects as tools of understanding—to avoid generic mystic-protagonist territory. However, she faces little active resistance or internal contradiction; her epiphany arrives smoothly, without much dramatized struggle or cost. The result is a well-drawn but somewhat low-pressure portrait rather than a fully tested character.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The diver’s intellectual and emotional conflict—having their lifelong beliefs overturned—is clear and consistent, and the statue’s ancient, patient guidance reads as a distinct character. Motivation is strong (the diver wants to understand; the statue wants to teach and fulfill its purpose), and the final shift in the diver’s stance feels earned. However, the interiority leans abstract, summarizing turmoil rather than embodying it in specific, character-particular sensations or contradictions. The lack of concrete personal stakes for the diver beyond “academic belief” keeps the arc from feeling fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s motivation (escape purgatory and reclaim the missed bet) is clear and consistent, and his “grim optimism” plus methodical intellect feel specific enough to him. However, his internal conflict is relatively thin: we’re told his nature is “balancedly daring,” but we rarely feel contradictory impulses in-scene (fear vs. risk, hope vs. resignation) grinding against each other. The key choice—using the chipped die to rupture the staircase and later making the bet—feels earned, but the emotional cost of eternity spent calculating is stated rather than deeply embodied. A bit more textured irrationality or self-deception under pressure would push this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The painter’s motive—proving that kindness persists across time—is clear and consistently tied to her actions (climbing, researching, painting through insomnia). Interiority feels specific in her devotion to lost languages and tools, but she faces almost no genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Insomnia and trembling fingers hint at cost, yet her emotional progression is largely steady and idealized. The final stance (hope vindicated) is believable but comes without a difficult micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The guide and Khira both feel specific—his "historically oriented ache" and her flinty "The bread remembers" give them texture and clear motives. However, the guide experiences little on-page contradiction or real emotional jeopardy; his hope largely overrules fear without a sharp internal clash. Their relationship is warm but not a crucible that forces a painful choice. The closing satisfaction in the image of Khira is earned but low-cost, more affirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    Esme’s motivation—to defy fate and use the hunger stone to alter reality—is clear and consistently tied to her identity as a counter-clockwise clockmaker, but she remains largely a single-note obsessive with little on-page internal contradiction. Emotional states are often labeled (“bleak exhilaration surged through her veins”) rather than embodied through more idiosyncratic perception and reaction. Her competence feels untested; the puzzle ultimately yields without genuine risk of failure or visible cost. The final transformation reads as an extension of her established drive but lacks a tough choice that would deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s fear and dawning acceptance are coherent, and the future-self advisor provides a functional foil, especially at the reveal: “I gasped to recognize myself.” However, interiority stays abstract—more ideas about fear than embodied contradictions—so the final transformation feels a bit too tidy and low-cost. The advisor’s motives and personality never deepen beyond “cryptic guide,” limiting relational pressure. Overall, the arc is clear but not yet richly human or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prophet is clearly drawn as competent, serene, and trusted, with a coherent motivation to transform threats into music. However, she faces little internal conflict or contradiction; her emotions are described more as role and purpose than as a fraught, embodied struggle. Her choices are largely frictionless successes, so we don’t see flaws or costs that would deepen her as a literary character. This limits the sense of a meaningful personal change or sacrifice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael’s motivations (finding his father/the expedition, understanding the watchers) are clear and consistent, and his occupational interiority as a spiral-shell cartographer feels specific. However, his internal conflict is mostly stated (“people called him obsessed”) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses under pressure. The pivot from wanting to question the watchers to accepting a guardian role happens quickly and cleanly, with little felt resistance or cost. He never truly wrestles on the page with sacrificing the fantasy of escape or reunion, which keeps the arc slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eleanor’s motivation and professional stance are clear and consistent, and her actions align with a coherent investigative drive. However, her interiority is largely summarized in generalized terms (“emotionally rational,” “scholarly objectivity”) rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses in the moment. We rarely see genuine internal conflict or a felt cost to her choices, so the arc reads more like a steady execution of a plan than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    The surveyor’s vocation and philosophical motive are clear and consistent, but he remains more an emblematic figure than a fully embodied, contradictory person. His “stoically sensitive” nature is mostly told rather than dramatized through clashing impulses under pressure. The dive for the box and the decision to add his own note offer small windows into his values, yet they never force a difficult trade-off or visibly cost him. As a result, he’s intriguing and coherent but not yet at the depth expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his professional habits (indexing, cross-referencing) shape his choices credibly. However, his internal journey is largely linear and smooth—he moves from curiosity to hypothesis to acceptance with little genuine friction or contradictory impulse. The emotional cost of reconfiguring his identity and family history is asserted more than dramatized. As a result, the change feels conceptually sound but not deeply earned on the level of lived, embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern maker’s grief and craft-based coping are clear and consistent, and his final act of placing the lantern reads as a credible, earned shift. However, internal conflict is largely summarized (“His motivation was singular”) rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses in scene. He rarely wavers or makes a hard trade-off; his choices feel foregone rather than pressured. The lack of other on-page characters limits relational complexity but fits the piece’s solitary frame.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias’s motivation (grief-fueled purpose) is clear and consistent, and the survivor backstory gives him a solid spine. However, his interiority is largely told in abstractions (“bleak exhilaration,” “nothing left to lose”) rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. He encounters no real resistance or moral friction, so we don’t see how he behaves under pressure beyond competence and determination. The closing shift—“becoming something else”—is asserted more than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s professional competence and mystical curiosity are clear and consistent, and her actions track cleanly with her stated goal. However, interior conflict is thin: we’re told she’s a “seeker of forgotten truths” and thematically adrift, but we don’t see a concrete, competing impulse or real hesitation under pressure. The “perpetually surprised” trait is repeated rather than deepened into something psychologically specific. Her final recognition that she is the missing piece is emotionally plausible but lands a bit as a neat thesis rather than a hard-won, messy shift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Martin’s guilt, professional self-loathing, and longing for absolution are clear and specific, with the grandfather erasure giving his remorse concrete stakes. His realization at the carving and decision to close the business are well-motivated by what precedes. However, his inner life leans on somewhat generalized phrasing (“weight of unspoken words,” “layers of deception”) rather than more idiosyncratic, conflict-on-the-page contradictions, which blunts peak intensity. The internal conflict could use one sharper, less tidy moment of resistance or self-justification before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra’s motivations are clear and consistent—her father’s history, her mantra, and her belief in moon-phase timing all cohere into a distinct professional and emotional stance. However, she faces remarkably little internal contradiction or visible struggle under pressure; the negotiation proceeds in line with her values rather than testing or complicating them. Rennett is more cipher than character, largely defined by posture and a single decisive line. The forgiveness moment feels earned enough, but its cost is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is clear and specific, with the failed research voyage and her father’s teachings grounding her guilt and competence. Her micro-choices (going out anyway after the job loss, choosing to use the compass as a talisman rather than a tool, reframing the poles as guides) are motivated and coherent. The shift from “broken navigator” to “student of the sea again” feels earned, though the conflict stays relatively tidy and could benefit from sharper contradictory impulses in-scene. Emotions are more narrated than embodied at peak beats, which slightly blunts their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator’s guilt, amnesia, and mission give a clear psychological frame, but their emotional life stays mostly in conceptual language rather than concrete, character-particular contradiction. We rarely see impulses genuinely clash under pressure; the choice of tunnel and the decision to sign the ball feel relatively untroubled. The relationship with the younger self is intriguing but sketched rather than used as a crucible. The final stance—accepting the loop to teach empathy—lands, but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliora’s grief-driven motivation (“to reforge a bond beyond death”) is clear and sustained, and her fear of losing her humanity creates a credible internal contradiction. Interiority is concrete in places (roots drinking moonlight, trembling heart versus steady fingers) rather than generic. The brother’s brief appearance still manages a distinct emotional presence and a recognizable dynamic. However, her metamorphosis into a bridge and then back again happens with relatively little struggle or cost on the page, which slightly flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    The cartomancer’s core motivation (reconciling with lost time after childbirth) is clear and consistent, and the emotional throughline from dread to acceptance tracks. However, interiority leans on summary and neat articulation of insight rather than textured contradiction under pressure. We seldom see simultaneous, messy impulses on the page—her repentance feels largely announced rather than hard-won in scene. The mother–child bond is potent but idealized, with little flaw or conflict to complicate her self-image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s motivation and values are clear and consistent, and the pacifism feels genuinely embodied in their method and outlook. However, their interiority remains a little generalized and saintly; we see conviction and sorrow but very little contradiction, pettiness, or irrationality under pressure. The fifty years of preparation are told rather than dramatized, blunting a sense of struggle. The final choice to cross over is moving but never feels in doubt, which limits the emotional cost of their change.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ian’s core drive (understanding transformation) and his history as a philanthropist are clear and consistent, and his final choice to release the bugs/give them away does track with what we know of him. However, his interiority leans abstract and summarizing—he rarely has sharply particular, embodied reactions—and his “epiphany” arrives with little real friction or contradictory impulse on the page. His ability to orchestrate coincidences is more told than dramatized, so it reveals little additional nuance about his psychology. The girl is essentially a function of prophecy with minimal distinct character or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias is clearly motivated—loyal to a covert revolutionary cause, calm under pressure, and professionally competent as keeper of keys and codes. However, he experiences almost no genuine internal contradiction or visible emotional cost; the calm inventiveness never strains or frays. The relationship with the Keeper is functional rather than a crucible—no status shift, disagreement, or ethically charged clash. As a result, he feels solid but somewhat one-note for a piece aiming at elite literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The eel herder’s motivation (curse + promise + need to understand patterns) is clear and consistent, and her ritual choices track with that. However, her emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied, and there’s little sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from torment to peace is asserted more than dramatized with concrete internal struggle. This keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at an elite-literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maia’s core motive (to reclaim voice and map collective/historical scars) is consistent and clearly rooted in her status as a censored poet, and her ritualized actions in the observatory align with that drive. Interiority is present and sometimes striking (“furiously tranquil expression”), but it leans archetypal and declarative rather than showing contradictory impulses under real pressure. The late realization of her power feels earned but low-cost—no difficult trade-off or visible risk on the page. Overall she feels coherent and specific enough for the lyric frame, but not yet complex or individuated enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aris is specific and memorable (dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, motto), with clear intellectual motives, but he’s under real pressure only in the most abstract sense. His interiority stays mostly in the realm of confident reflection rather than contradictory impulses or felt cost. The student functions as a foil but has almost no depth or pressure of her own. The final “shift” is more a reaffirmation of who he already is than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    The poet’s core motive—preserving and rebuilding knowledge as resistance—is clear and consistent, and the Elias relationship gives that motive credible roots. The personality-molting and memory gaps add a strong, specific flaw with some cost. However, internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in on-page micro-choices, so we rarely feel him pulled between competing impulses in the moment. The emotional experience skews conceptual and mission-driven rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pianist’s grief, love for his daughter, and resignation-to-defiance arc are clear, specific, and consistent, with the clock and lullaby nicely embodying his motive. His decision to act now rather than accept shutdown is well-motivated by the backward-ticking clock. However, internal conflict is underplayed; once he decides on the plan, there’s little felt doubt or degradation under pressure. The result is strong but not yet psychologically complex enough for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation (protecting fading collective memory before the monsoon) is clear and consistent, and her role as “reality checker” gives her a distinct frame of mind. We see some interior contradiction—duty and competence carrying her forward even as doubt creeps in near the climax. However, her emotional life is somewhat generalized (“weight of generations,” “childlike wonder”) and not deeply particularized in concrete, idiosyncratic terms. The final “luminous doubt” is compelling but could be better prepared through more textured struggle on the way to the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tutor’s motivation (years-long quest to find “the color of unspoken apologies”) is clear and consistent, and his ritualistic behavior around the compass and bonsai trees is character-specific. The relationship with his brother and the ghost ship roots his guilt, but that relationship stays summarized rather than dramatized, so the emotional conflict feels slightly abstract. His key turn—confessing what he never told “her” and then his brother’s name—lands but comes a bit too smoothly, without much visible resistance or contradiction on the page. The arc is credible and coherent, but not yet cutting or complex enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist's internal state is summarized rather than dramatized through choice or action. Motivation ("to strip needless drama") is explicitly stated rather than revealed through conflict or pressure. There is no active struggle; the character simply drifts from one realization to another in an iterative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.6)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and label-like traits ("steadily adaptive") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal conflict is explicitly stated ("no longer creating art for art's sake") but does not manifest in difficult on-page choices or contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.5)
    Motivation is asserted via summary ("hoped to rectify") rather than dramatized through struggle or contradictory impulses. The repetitive use of the epithet "the capsize survivor" creates distance and prevents the development of a specific, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on stock archetypes ("weary undertaker") and declarative labels rather than dramatized interiority. Motivation is driven by convenient epiphanies ("With sudden clarity, Elias understood") rather than genuine psychological pressure or internal conflict. The protagonist moves through the plot on rails without making difficult, cost-laden choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    Elias is an idealized figure without internal contradiction or flaw; his leadership is presented through noble exposition rather than struggle. The central conflict—scarcity—is resolved by a speech rather than a difficult choice with visible cost, making him feel like a parable figure rather than a human character. Dialogue functions primarily as a delivery mechanism for themes rather than revealing distinct personality or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or genuine struggle, functioning primarily as a vessel for the prompt’s requirements. Characterization relies heavily on expository labels (e.g., "As a spiritually curious person") rather than demonstrated behavior or choice under pressure. Her acceptance of the supernatural element is immediate and frictionless, missing an opportunity for human reaction or skepticism. The transition from artist to healer feels unearned, as she faces no meaningful obstacles or hard choices to achieve this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Character motivation is summarized ("motivated to discover") rather than dramatized through active choices under pressure. Emotions are delivered via abstract labels ("terrifying yet intoxicating") instead of embodied sensation, creating a distant, synopsis-like effect that prevents genuine connection.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    The protagonist is an archetype defined by asserted labels ("patiently strategic") rather than embodied choices or internal contradiction. The lack of genuine struggle or flawed decision-making leaves her flat, serving only as a vehicle for prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael’s motivation to capture "betrayal" is intellectually stated rather than emotionally dramatized; the connection between his cancer diagnosis and this specific obsession feels abstract. The interiority relies on summary ("He was obsessed with...") rather than embodied experience in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation relies on abstract poetic phrases ("press her ear against destiny's door") rather than embodied desire or specific need. Lillian faces no internal contradiction or genuine struggle; her success is attributed to "impossible grace" and "practiced gaze" rather than decisions made under pressure. The transition from thief to historian feels like a label swap rather than a hard-won character change.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("contemplative," "darkest emotional winter") rather than embodied behavior. The protagonist's motivation is stated explicitly in dialogue ("to craft safe zones") rather than revealed through difficult choices or friction. There is no internal contradiction or resistance; Elias simply performs his role without distinct human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("claustrophobia," "cleithrophobia," "firmly adaptive") rather than dramatized behavior. Interiority is summarized through abstract emotional states ("shaken her to the core") rather than embodied reaction. The protagonist's motivation is stated in exposition rather than emerging from the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions clearly as an archetype with a distinct goal, but her internal landscape relies on told labels ("mildly obsessed," "violently determined") rather than embodied complexity. The tonal clash of the attribute "mildly obsessed" disrupts the mythic voice, making the character feel like a vessel for prompt adherence rather than a living presence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    Motivation is asserted via narration ("motivated for cycles by one question") rather than dramatized through friction or resistance. The protagonist overrides its core "protocol" without hesitation or internal conflict, making the transition from janitor to cosmic being feel unearned. The "existential processors" operate as a convenient label for interiority rather than a source of genuine character voice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Character motivation is delivered via exposition ("desire to thaw mistrust") rather than dramatized through struggle or contradictory impulses. The protagonist's pivotal choice to leave the lens is framed as a "test of integrity" that is passed instantly without visible cost or internal conflict, making her feel more like a parable vehicle than a person.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elias functions as a coherent archetype but lacks internal contradiction or specific, embodied struggle. His motivation is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices; he acts as a vehicle for the theme without facing a genuine test of his values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    Aris is a functional vessel for the plot with no internal contradiction or distinct voice. Her motivation is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and she pays no emotional or physical cost for her success, resulting in a flat character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.3)
    Motivation is abstract ("artistic journey") and stated rather than dramatized through pressure. Internal experience is filtered through labels ("felt a familiar pull," "felt in his bones") rather than visceral embodiment. Elias lacks genuine agency or struggle; he drifts through the scene with compliant emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is distinct and drives agency effectively. The interpretation of "fault-tolerant" as functioning through knowledge lacunae is clever and shapes his specific interaction with the plot's central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.6)
    The protagonist functions as a generic archetype ("intrepid pilot") rather than a specific individual; he observes the plot rather than driving it through difficult decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.1)

    Characterization relies on contradictory labels ("attentive mystic" yet "firmly grounded") that clash with the on-page action of divining via frost.

Emotional reaction is summarized ("determination burned brighter") rather than embodied in action or visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.8)

    Samuel is a distinct presence with a unique trait, but his motivation acts more as a philosophical directive than a felt, embodied drive.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.7)

    Lyra's motivation roots convincingly in the drawer pull and mantra, compelling the final forgiveness; Rennett's rigidity softens credibly. Interiority embodied via warm pull and wind-whipped hair, but "uncommonly thoughtful" labels constrain less than they tell, muting micro-choice tradeoffs at the ritual peak.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong embodied interiority via compass as pulsing weight and smiling irony amid regrets; contradictory impulses (paddling forward despite backlash) build to earned reconfiguration of self as "student of the sea." Minor therapy-speak in "align heart and action" slightly abstracts peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Protagonist's contradictory impulses emerge in trembling hands amid forgotten past versus seeking empathy, but internal conflict summarizes more than acts simultaneously until ball-signing choice. Motivation to kindle empathy compels tunnel choice with felt cost of loop endurance. Minor epiphany slips in "jaded wonder washed over me" feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong interior conflict in reluctance to lose humanity versus drive to reconnect, embodied in steady fingers amid heart tremor and root-growing feet; earned endurance as she transforms back unchanged yet with fuller heart. Minor abstraction in "cosmic intimacy" dilutes peak embodiment slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Embodied emotions peak in tears and throat pressure during visions, earning the surrender at climax; contradictory awe/dread drives micro-choices like embracing confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli's pacifism and shadow work integration show contradictory impulses acting in the stitching scene, earning the transcendence choice; embodied lightness from hope reveals character under pressure. Minor therapy-speak in "inner reconciliation" slightly abstracts emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ian's motivation roots deeply in prior fortune release, intensifying to compel the release and gifting of bugs; contradictory study vs. becoming impulses act in the realization beat. Girl as secondary applies prophetic pressure cleanly. Minor diagnostic phrasing in epiphany ("transformation wasn't something to be studied but experienced") slightly undercuts embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's calm inventiveness drives micro-choices like concealing the brush in the quill holder and painting covertly, revealing traits through action. Internal conflict subtle in balancing authority with secrecy, embodied in warm quill against ribs amid tension. Secondary characters (guard, Keeper) apply targeted pressure via whispers and confirmations. Minor slip: emotions mostly declarative, less contradictory layering.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Earned character arc peaks convincingly at "She finally understood what her mentor had tried to teach her," shifting curse from torment to guidance with felt cost of prior isolation. Interiority embodied in trembling fingers and visions, though some backstory summaries slightly dilute immediacy. Contradictory impulses between control and harmony act in the stone-placing ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong interior contradiction in "furiously tranquil expression" hiding revolutionary fire, embodied in trembling fingers tracing scars; motivation to map scars drives micro-choices like arranging notebook/envelope. Final endurance of nightly vigil feels earned via prior causality. Minor slip: some epiphanic abstraction like "power of truth, like lightning" borders on unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris's motivation to decode and teach emerges through concrete actions like aligning the needle card; mechanical arm integrates as symbol and tool in student demo. Interiority concrete but edges into label-speak ("diplomatically fierce"); student's comprehension feels earned via sparring.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong particular voice and flawed fragmentation drive endurance of mission, with Elias as emotional anchor amid memory gaps. Contradictory impulses more summarized than acting simultaneously in scene, like molting's tradeoffs told via reflection. Final rebuilding stacks as earned stasis, but lacks peak embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pianist's motivation rooted in daughter's loss and clock anomaly compels descent and refuge choice with embodied emotion in weaving lullaby; internal conflict of prior acceptance vs. tonight's resolve shown but not deeply simultaneous in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Empirically whimsical nature enables dream interpretation and singing despite creeping doubt, earning the ancestral voices surge; contradictory impulses act in the cave scene as she sings through self-doubt. Minor slip: embodied emotion strong but doubt resolved too tidily without lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong consistent motivation rooted in brother's loss compels ritual choices, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; interiority concrete yet reflective dominates over pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s shift from cosmic to micro-focus is well-anchored in her perceptual lens; the interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the final stance of “witness and honor” is earned by the accumulated dust-garden beat. However, no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—she never fights the return to astrophysics or resists the humility—so the change feels like acceptance rather than costly renunciation. The butterfly-wing dust as talisman is character-specific, yet its handling is observational, not a micro-choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lena’s adaptive trait is asserted repeatedly but only demonstrated once—she decides to return to town after the frost reading. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“artist must become the art”) rather than embodied contradiction. The ledger-frost connection is clever but arrives late, so the choice feels more engineered than lived. Earned renunciation is present, yet the emotional cost is stated, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.1)
    Elena’s trauma and new vocation are sketched, yet her interior contradictions remain asserted (“rectify the great wrong of silence”) rather than dramatized in beat-level choices. The only on-page micro-choice—striking the fork and tracing heat—repeats without escalating cost; no stakes-internal tension is exposed. The promised “credible endurance” is diluted into lyric declaration, so the final smile feels soft, not earned. Diagnostic label-speak (“the great wrong of silence”) recycles twice, triggering a –0.5 diagnostic penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” trait is shown only once (deciding to follow the lens); otherwise he is a passive observer. No contradictory interiority under pressure; the climax is handed to him by the lens’s magic. The shift from undertaker to keeper is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. Still, the vocational backstory gives him a specific worldview that colors every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s quiet endurance and refusal to claim credit ring true; his interiority stays concrete (“understood the unspoken message”) and his micro-choice to expand the runs shows a visible cost in risking scarcity. The motivation to keep the community whole is steady, but the stakes jump is announced rather than embodied—no moment shows him doubting or calculating the real hunger price. Mira’s pressure line is the only beat that forces a tactical shift, so the characterization is strong yet not quite piercing the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.5)
    The interiority is evocative but drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“spiritually curious,” “pilgrim of sparks”) that short-circuits contradiction. The micro-choice chain is thin: only the altered-breath beat alters the image; everything else is retrospective gloss. A single embodied cost—the tear dissolving—lands, yet it is narrated as completion rather than felt renunciation. The arc is gentle acceptance, but the prior-life caretaker layer never collides with present stakes; it merely corroborates the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—she “traces the tendrils” and later “sketches impossible shapes”—yet her motives stay abstract: “discover the texture of time” is stated, never dramatized as a concrete refusal or loss. The merging-with-garden ending supplies a visible cost, but the beat is summarized, not enacted, so the change feels predetermined rather than chosen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s contradictory state—chained yet liberating—shows in embodied beats (fumbling arrow to pick lock) and micro-choices (risking capture to pocket seeds). Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “surge of hope mixed with urgency.” Final renunciation—losing the vault but keeping the arrow—carries visible cost. Flaws: motivation stated abstractly early (“restore what had been lost”); no interior contradiction shown during actual seed theft; secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship/status crucible unused.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael’s interior contradiction—designing perfect aids yet hunting betrayal—powers the arc, but the cancer label (“just weeks ago”) arrives as exposition, not embodied cost; the final renunciation is credibly earned yet softened by overt lyric summarizing rather than a concrete last gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lillian’s quietly-savvy trait is embodied early—she reads the desktop’s disorder while chatting—and her micro-movement to swap the jar is crisp. The “golden-hour portrait thief” label is illustrated rather than asserted, and the final renunciation (she becomes a historian, not thief) carries visible cost. Interiority is mostly concrete, though “her destiny wasn’t to steal light but to preserve it” edges diagnostic; still, prior causality supports it. One contradictory impulse moment (wanting vs. guarding light) would sharpen 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s grief and creative paralysis are palpable through his embodied rituals and narration-as-defense, but the interior contradiction—his need to speak meaning into every gesture—never sharpens into a choice that costs him anything on the page; the “thaw” is declared rather than dramatized by a micro-decision that forecloses an alternative. The bookmark and globe remain emotionally potent yet external; they don’t force him to relinquish a last illusion or habit, so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s claustrophobia and cleithrophobia are dramatized through crouched posture, trembling hands, and controlled breathing, grounding the fear in the body. The stunt-double résumé is asserted rather than shown and never complicates tactics; the “billionaire daughter” reveal feels plot-twist convenient, not character-earned. Interiority is vivid (“stars peek through broken skylight” refracted by her panic), but the final epiphany about vulnerability-as-power is articulated, not dramatized via a micro-choice that costs her anything on the spot.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The oracle’s interiority is textured—her fingers “tracing worn edges,” her mind “extending outward”—but her obsession is declared (“mildly obsessed,” “violently determined”) rather than shown through contradictions or micro-costs. No embodied emotion contradicts the label; the booklet and pebbles are handled reverently yet never jeopardize her calm. The final stance crystallizes, but the cost is conceptual, not personally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    Unit 347’s curiosity (“where did its thoughts come from?”) is concrete and shapes every beat; its decision to override protocol and play the violin is a visible micro-choice that costs it its prior stability. The emotional shift from servant to self-author is embodied in the cold seeping into joints and the internal harmonies that replace external directives. Yet the transformation is expressed in abstract thesis language (“by serving others, it had been serving its own evolution”) rather than a singular, irreversible act we can witness, slightly blunting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motives—curiosity, then custodial honesty—are legible, but her interiority stays generic (“heart raced,” “realized now”). The renunciation beat (leaving the lens) is因果ally earned yet emotionally skimmed; we get abstract virtue, not the felt cost of surrendering god-sight. No contradictory impulses play out in scene; she glides from discovery to ethical choice without friction or body-level fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“gnarled hands brushing against leaves,” “withered state mirrored the seasonal cycles”), and his ritual of polishing cracked marbles externalizes a contradictory impulse—restore yet preserve fracture—that stays active through the final embedding. The cost of his endurance is visible in the closing image: he renounces quantifiable proof and accepts a slow dying that deepens the garden bond, an earned stasis. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the apprentice is off-stage and exerts no pressure. Micro-choices (where to place each marble, whispered defiance to scientists) reveal a hierarchy of values without resorting to diagnostic self-talk.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid—her “mechanically warm” fingers and “icy warmth” blood register contradictory embodiment—but her motives remain abstract (“prove time moves sideways”) rather than rooted in a personal wound or relational stake we can feel. The bird’s awakening is observed, not interacted with, so the crucible is one-sided; no second character pressures her to test or renounce the theory, so status dynamics and relationship change are absent. Micro-choices (lever pulls) are present, yet they feel like pre-programmed steps rather than risky gambits with visible trade-offs; the cost is intellectual, not visceral. Still, the prose keeps her perception concrete and idiosyncratic enough to lift her above a stock “scientist” stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s obsession with the ghost aria is made visceral through embodied ritual (wading through floodwater, nightly returns). The dissolution of the program in his hands at the climax literalizes a credible renunciation: he surrenders the physical key once the music is released, showing cost. Interiority avoids label-speak; his “strange kinship” is dramatized by the act of playing rather than exposition. The only flaw is a slight over-reliance on atmospheric shorthand (“something he couldn’t name”) before the first conscious choice; still, the final beat earns the shift from curiosity to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s contradictory drives—scientist vs oracle, archivist vs violator—collide in the deliberate smudge; the fever-recovery body anchors every beat, and the swallowed-meteor ache keeps pressure visceral. The grandfather’s flower drawing acts as a charged proxy for identity, making the act of defacement feel like self-surgery. One flaw: the swallowed truth’s literal mass is stated early but not tested in a micro-choice; we are told the weight, not shown it bending his posture or forcing a tactical trade-off. Still, the final image of him carrying auroral sorrow toward the cave lands as earned endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s reckless-explorer trait is shown through action (kneeling to pocket the valve) and interior contradiction (skeptic vs. believer), but the swallowed-truth motive is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page cost is paid for his recklessness, so the arc feels observed, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The keeper’s detachment and embodied rituals (etching stone, folding paper) are vivid; the loose grip on reality enables the burrow and the refusal to surrender to stasis, a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—the interiority is steady observation—so the 9+ “contradictory impulses in scene” test fails by a hair. Still, the enduring witness ethos and final return to river noise show a scaled, individual arc that forecloses the tempting silence. Characterization is specific, non-diagnostic, and tightly wedded to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete—her locket touch, the because/therefore link between her father-loss and Lila’s silence—but the “softly adaptive” trait is label-only until the drum moment, and her emotional layering flattens into therapeutic epiphany-speak at the eclipse. Lila’s first words feel slightly convenient; the drum choice is credible, but the causal bridge from muteness to speech could show more micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian’s motivation is clear and consistent, but the interiority stays at a reverent distance; no contradictory impulse ever complicates the pilgrimage. Actions (tracing threads, extracting pages) are delicate but never risk failure or moral cost, so the final “rare smile” feels unearned. The character functions more as a sensitive recording device than as a crucible of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The writer’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. All choices are summarized (“he sealed the last fortune”) rather than performed under pressure, so no cost is embodied. The arc is observation, not transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation—prove the entity’s arrogance—stays visible, but interiority stays priest-centric; Sarah is a puppet, never a second will in play. Micro-choice registers only in pedal presses and paint strokes; the moment he smiles at the hidden assumption is the single beat where interior contradiction surfaces. Earned cost is present (anchor left humming, priest exhausted), yet the child’s reclaimed silence is felt more than his. Voice remains coherent, but the absence of Sarah’s interior keeps the relational crucible cool.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is lyrical, embodied, and character-specific; the nautilus shell as extension of self under pressure works. No contradictory impulses in scene—memory-flow is linear, not conflicting—so the 9+ gate fails. Still, the collapse beat carries credible cost and ties to the grandfather gift, earning the renunciation. Voice remains consistent, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for belonging yet fearing what he might learn—surface in embodied beats (hovering hesitation, pocket-clutch). The tablet, his own reflection, and the eclipse act as mirrors that force micro-choices; each step across the viaduct visibly costs him certainty. Interiority avoids label-speak, showing dread as “the paradoxical sensation keeping him disoriented.” Closure accepts the gravity-defying self with earned cost: he returns lighter yet forever exiled from ordinary physics.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s desire to “defeat emotional numbness” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an internal contradiction; her body sways and cries, yet we’re told rather than shown the hierarchy of values she risks. The broken-needle discovery is pure serendipity, so her ensuing “tool” use feels gifted, not earned. Students appear too late to act as crucible, so the status shift from despair to teacher lacks on-page opposition. Still, her embodied emotion (“tears,” “fingers remembering rhythms”) keeps the arc credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s “credibly curious” label is repeated but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice; his final decision to send the pigeon is rational, tidy, and cost-free. No interior contradiction plays out in real time—every beat is summary. The only embodied moment (trembling fingers) is instantly explained away, flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory in scene: trembling fingers, tears, the micro-choice to breathe the scents he has feared. His refusal to fight grief any longer is earned through the ultraviolet reveal cascade and carries visible cost—he accepts lifelong haunting. Aromatic caution is more than label; it governs every beat until he breaks it. The only polish needed: slightly earlier anchoring of the sister’s name to sharpen first-image irony.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s obsession with “the texture of time” is vivid and embodied in knot-making; interiority stays concrete. Yet no contradictory impulse ever collides with that drive—every micro-choice ratifies the same impulse—so the arc is additive, not conflicted. The final coil-and-departure is credible but costs nothing on the page; the rope neither snags nor forecloses a path. Interior texture is strong; dramatic tension is one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s contradictory impulses—clinging to silence while mining it for music—surface only in summary; the one embodied beat is the bowl-amplification experiment. The final “unbind silence” choice is prepared by the family storytelling but still drifts into abstract declaration rather than a dramatized fork with visible cost. Interiority is atmospheric, not wrestled with under real-time pressure; we are told his purpose is “to unbind” rather than shown a micro-choice that hurts. Earned stasis is gestured at, yet the cost feels conceptual, not lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias has a clear, idiosyncratic occupation and a tactile gift, but his interiority repeats the same note—pride in half-truths—without contradictory impulse under pressure. The client remains a passive canvas; no relationship crucible or status shift tests him. The final smile is pretty, yet we never feel a wound or renunciation; the cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elias’s “whimsically attentive” trait is shown rather than told—he notices locket, envelope, names, anniversaries—and this drives the inciting approach. Interiority stays concrete (“familiar stirring” when he meets obscurity). Yet the leap from charity funding to emotional locket-gift feels foregone; no contradictory impulse or visible flaw complicates his generosity, so the final stance lacks cost. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and occupation informs choices without expository dump.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s loneliness-to-belonging arc is viscerally embodied through reed-sculpting micro-choices; the final carving moment shows contradictory impulses (claiming kinship while etching loss) with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“hollowness” is paired with tactile arbor pulses—avoiding label-speak. Status shifts under group pressure are legible: she moves from tolerated outsider to ritual leader. The only minor drag is Kael/Mira remaining types rather than crucible-sharpened voices, but Elara’s flaw-driven momentum dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    The illustrator’s interiority stays thin—no contradictory impulses surface in-scene; all motive is declared (“His motivation burned within him”). The single micro-choice (shatter the cage) arrives without prior tactical use of the pendant to foreshadow cost, so the final sacrifice feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lush and sensorially anchored (“fingers tracing chipped patterns,” “buried optimism surged”), but the mentor-shaped void is declared rather than dramatized; the single micro-choice—ritual continuation—lacks a palpable fork or forfeiture, so the change feels incremental rather than costly. The glass-eye vision supplies a flicker of earned contradiction, yet Elara’s flaw/blind spot remains theoretical, muting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dweller’s motive—helping others when information fails—is declared repeatedly but never dramatized; no scene shows a living patron failing or needing rescue. Interiority drifts into generic nostalgia (“smell of old books, ticking clocks”) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision to intervene is stated, not micro-staged; we never see a concrete choice that costs them visibility or safety. Kindly methodical stays label-only; no tactical trade-off reveals how this trait complicates or enables the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete (traces leaf-veins with compass, trembles as she dismantles shields) and her oscillation between control/ surrender is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Micro-choices—opening vents, walking away—carry visible cost and mark an earned shift. Flaw (mild): “reluctant metamorphosis” is named four separate times instead of shown through body alone.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lena’s insomnia-as-identity is embodied in trembling hands and pigment choices; the amber brooch becomes an externalized organ of memory, forcing a micro-choice (exchange) that costs her talismanic comfort and earns the new palette. Interior contradiction is present—clutching warmth while courting exchange—and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the brooch’s solace for public testimony. Voice keeps painterly perceptual signature (“restless oceans and fragmented memories”) without diagnostic self-talk. Slight dip: the old woman functions more as benefactor than crucible, so status pressure is muted; still, the protagonist’s flawed attachment and earned renunciation carry the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly concrete—“the pearl pulsed with an inner light… unlike anything she had ever encountered”—and her shift from observer to participant is embodied in the moment she touches the shadow-infused crystal. Internal contradiction is present: pride in foresight vs. being blindsided, yet this stays in summary rather than erupting in a visible micro-choice. The final smile lands as credible renunciation, but the cost is only implied; we see no forfeiture of her old seer-identity on the page. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and the arc is legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elina’s interiority is lyrically textured and her perceptual signature consistent, but her motivations remain abstract—“compile fragments into meaning” is repeated without concrete micro-choices that cost her anything on the page. The absence of a visible decision or renunciation in closure keeps the arc just shy of earned.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Ethan’s “analytically artistic” trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment where the two impulses clash; the interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“he sensed rather than understood”) that flattens emotional pressure. The phantom punch integrates physically, yet its selection of him is asserted, not earned through visible flaw or choice. No contradictory micro-choice under stress shows the hierarchy of values; the story tells us the punch “had chosen him” instead of dramatizing a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s skeptical warmth is credibly embodied—she presses and rotates the tile rather than merely “believing.” Interior contradiction is light; her shift from private transcription to communal invitation is earned, yet the cost of that openness (lost solitude, possible ridicule) is asserted more than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Alistair’s ennui is sketched vividly at the top (“each century stretching like taffy”), but once the amulet fragment ignites his intrigue, internal contradiction fades; the pivot from boredom to urgent mission is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choice. No real flaw complicates his restored purpose; the “cost” of accepting immortality is asserted in the final paragraph, not embodied in scene. Elara’s absence is a useful ghost, yet the beat where he discovers the fragment is hers summarizes rather than shows the emotional hit, keeping the change more intellectual than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip on the ink pot, the tremor as she dials the safe—but the “mathematics of a fair trade” is declared twice without being dramatized in a micro-choice. The father–daughter contradiction is present yet never collides in-scene; we’re told she refuses his path rather than shown a live temptation. Still, her embodied emotions and the visible cost of job-loss risk keep her credibly flawed and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s quiet obsession is rendered through tactile ritual—gold-stained fingers, the reverent lift of a page—so his solitary vocation feels lived-in. The “incandescent restraint” demanded by the dawn ceremony shows contradictory impulses (hunger for preservation vs. isolation’s cost) in the same breath, not in alternating abstracts. Only the final smile drifts toward performed epiphany; otherwise interiority stays embodied and particular. Micro-choices (applying the fleck of gold, sealing the note) foreclose tomorrow’s repetition with visible, scaled cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The interior voice is razor-distinct: “I filter reality differently … view the world as a palimpsest.” Contradictory impulses—hunger for identity vs acceptance of erasure—co-exist in every beat; the pocketed poison label is handled twice and reweights self-definition. The final stance, “I have become something more than records can contain,” is earned by the palimpsest tactic dramatized across tidal cycles; the cost is the lifelong exile from bureaucratic personhood. Voice never drifts into diagnostic cliché; even “nameless identity” is immediately complicated by sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Evelyn’s curiosity is credibly rooted in her “myth-buster” identity, and her embodied reactions to the cello’s vibrations give us concrete micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (“gloomy cheerfulness”) rather than diagnostic, and her final refusal to debunk—accepting uncertainty—does carry cost. Flaws are present but muted; the story tells us she is changed rather than dramatizing a visible behavioral cost on her next steps. Still, contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. wonder) play in real time during the cello beats, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—preserve elders’ carnival or bow to gentrifiers—remains vivid and embodied; the foundation-stone chip pressed in pocket, paint under nails, “signs and symbols” muttered while tracing murals. Motivation escalates: from passive pattern-seeing to active cipher-making, culminating in the risky anonymous counter-proposal. The final relinquishment of the chip back to the communal monument shows earned cost, not tidy triumph. Voice stays particular; no therapeutic self-labelling, only salt-stung, paint-stained choices.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s “purposefully curious” trait is embodied in the deliberate camera work and the sand-grain timing device, not merely labeled. Interiority is concrete (“dawnlit melancholy…settled deep in her bones”) and tracks with bodily action under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting permanent loss in exchange for preservation—carries visible cost and is prepared by prior beats; however, the absence of any second on-page character keeps the crucibal relationship and status dynamics inapplicable, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority stays tactile and specific—his fingers “read” the drone like braille, a lovely character-particular filter. The central contradiction—blind yet seeing more than the sighted—drives every beat and is credibly embodied. A micro-choice under pressure (the final circuit splice) seals the cost and relationship shift. Only flaw: the “kind eyes that never opened” cliché is a touch ornamental and slightly undercuts the embodied blindness premise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is scenic and embodied—the pen-click, phrasebook dog-ear, condensation tracing—but the “subtly confident” trait is asserted more than pressure-tested. No relational crucible is on-stage, so status/secondary-character bullets are waived. The final beat of understanding lands as an epiphany rather than a renunciation with visible cost, so the arc feels tidy rather than paid-for. Competent, but not yet at the crucible-level contradiction that would lift it to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas’s “infinitely patient” gait and the embodied ritual of fork-strike → footfall give him a consistent, occupation-specific rhythm, but interior contradiction is only implied, never dramatized in-scene; the absence of any micro-choice that costs him something keeps the arc shy of full credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—oxygen gauge, trembling fingers, salt taste—yet her “mother’s hands” flashback lands as stock sentiment rather than embodied contradiction. A single micro-choice (pressing the vial) crystallizes her hierarchy of values, but the story withholds any genuine flaw that could complicate her triumph; the override of instinct is declared, not dramatized via a visible mistake. Competence stays high, struggle low; the absence of a cost-bearing blind spot keeps her just shy of publish-now caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The son’s need to escape his father’s legacy of lies is clear, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“he practiced his truth in the mirror”) rather than dramatized micro-choice; embodied emotion is strong in the lattice-touching beats, yet the climactic “whisper the truth” is reported, not shown under pressure, so the renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ghost bride’s interiority is vividly rendered through her sensual yearning for soil and sunlight, but her contradictory impulses (duty vs. desire) are told rather than enacted in scene; the final dispersal of seeds is a single micro-choice that earns her release, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. No secondary character applies live pressure, so the “relationships as crucible” bullet is N/A; the debt motive remains abstract, so the endurance reads as serene rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive—transform ruin into reverence—is stated repeatedly but never tested by a conflicting want; her sleep-stitching is lyrically rendered yet remains an unbroken trance, so no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure ever surfaces. The “hauntingly optimistic” trait is asserted, not embodied in a visible trade-off or cost. Because the arc is purely accumulative, the absence of interior tension is acceptable under that lens, but it keeps the character short of lived complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s “warmly curious” nature is asserted more than embodied; only one micro-choice (offering to help) shows the trait altering tactics. Interiority drifts toward summary (“memories stirring”) rather than moment-by-moment contradiction. The final renunciation of exile is credible, yet the cost is generalized (“weight of exile lift”) rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or visible stain, so the change feels mildly under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured—her tactile ritual with the clipboard, the chalk code, the letter’s weight—but her “transformation” is declared, not dramatized: the final smile never pays the cost of the soul-piece she claims to have surrendered. The scientist-client remains off-stage, so the crucible is only Elara vs. her own summary, flattening contradiction. The micro-choices (chalk, drop the letter) are atmospheric, not fork-in-the-road moments that foreclose a path. Result: competent portrait, yet the decisive internal shift feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “wise fool” contradiction is dramatized in two on-page micro-choices: the public self-diminishment to the official and the private decision to thread coded sabotage. Interiority is concrete (“stitched her needle through star-flecked fabric” vs. “feigned confusion”), but emotions stay slightly performed rather than rawly embodied. The final stance—continuing to embroider while the coup collapses off-stage—is a credible renunciation, yet the cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt, keeping her short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s longing and ritual agency feel lived-in; the shard’s warmth and her tear against the glass embody her stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“fierce tenderness,” “heart pounding”). The final forgiveness is earned because the entire quest has been a micro-choice to seek the pre-decision moment. No contradictory impulse on-page keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s “shrewdly innocent” translator persona is vivid and embodied; his tactile reading of the cast and coral shows micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, never slipping into label-speak, and the final whispered lie to the sleeping child crystallizes earned cost. The only hairline slip: the backstory paragraph (“Pacific conflict zones had taught him patience…”) is a 19% reflective block that summarizes rather than dramatizes a prior choice, slightly diluting the real-time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Amelia’s interior contradiction—artist who has lost her own color yet can still conjure it for others—is dramatized in micro-choices: she caresses the gray shard, risks her reputation on the observatory show, and watches strangers cry while her own joy “surfaces.” The cost is visible when the council sneers and when she stays up all night, paint-stained, trading sleep for revelation. Flaw: the “lost joy” is named more than embodied in body-level ache; still, the final smile is earned because every previous refusal to quit is on-page. One hairline slip from occasional therapeutic self-label (“rediscover lost joy”) keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing a chipped violinist’s face while mentally calculating paint ratios” shows embodied expertise—but the five abstract “awakenings” are declared rather than dramatized, so the decisive shift from certainty to curiosity feels imposed, not earned by visible micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaelen’s charm-mask never cracks under monitor-fire; the half-smile is the only external cue we get, so his inner calculus stays vivid. The contradiction—erudite rogue paying tax on memory—is shown, not told, and motivates every micro-choice from gourd-shake to chrysanthemum-row. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so the relationship crucible is absent, capping the arc below 8.0. Still, the final “untaxed thought” moment is earned renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The insomniac poet’s interior contradiction—using sleeplessness to guard others’ dreams—anchors the piece, but the story never lets us see a moment where that contradiction buckles under pressure. All choices are reported, not dramatized; the one micro-choice that could have shown cost (the final surrender to sleep) is off-stage. Earned stasis is claimed (“to remain awake so others might rest”) yet never tested in scene, so the cap is 6.8.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleth’s caretaker identity is consistent and motive (preserve forgotten names) is legible, yet interiority borders on lyrical self-label (“foxglove regret”) rather than embodied contradiction; no secondary character on page, so no crucible pressure beyond self, but micro-choices in the repair ritual keep agency alive. Emotional arc lands in wistful smile-through-tears that feels earned by the preceding ritual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—“breath catching,” “fingers trembled with cautious exuberance”—and her scholarly obsession is embodied in the tactile ritual with the ink well. Yet her contradictory impulses (caution vs. recklessness) are asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured micro-choice; we never see her risk a flawed translation in real time. The “carefully reckless” tag repeats without a visible moment where that tension snaps into a costly decision. Closure is Earned Stasis—she accepts the possibility of dismissal—so motivation holds, but the flaw/complication never actively compounds within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s inner contradiction—the trembling anxiety versus the slyly heartfelt gambit—remains vivid; the chain-as-talisman choice at the end is earned. Yet the “encrypted compassion” epiphany is stated more than dramatized in body or breath, keeping her from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts into self-diagnosis (“trying to bury the loss beneath new layers of identity”). The decisive shift to “Elara of the Flight Paths” is signaled rather than dramatized in-scene; we watch her write the letter but never see the internal contradiction collide with an external test that forces the signature. Motivation is legible, yet the emotional cost is asserted, not embodied, in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-borne perseverance and father-fixation are vivid; her “featherly” bodying of determination (dust-mote/stepping-through-water) keeps contradiction alive. Interiority is concrete but leans toward label-speak (“sacred geometry,” “thresholds of transformation”) that blunts raw edge. One strong micro-choice—touching the oak doorway—triggers the final memory, yet the climactic forgiveness is delivered paternalistically rather than wrested. Cost is felt but not visibly paid by her body; the embrace is sweet, not earned through visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    A single interior contradiction surfaces when Maya removes her glove to touch the glass—risking flood-chill for communion—yet this moment is isolated; elsewhere emotion stays at summary level (tears “welled as understanding dawned”) rather than embodied cost. Her motivation drifts from scientific curiosity to cosmic belonging without a micro-choice that forecloses the previous stance; the burnt feather guides but never tests her. The final shift to “understanding as destination” is asserted, not paid for by a visible renunciation or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    Interiority is lush but abstract; "cheerful gloom" etc. iterate without contradiction or embodied cost. No micro-choice tightens after seed-planting; realization arrives as declarative summary, not staked action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    Leo’s “analytical” tag is shown only in summary; the one on-page micro-choice—dropping the bishop—reads as rehearsed routine, not active calculation under pressure. Interiority drifts into editorial commentary (“he congratulated himself”) rather than embodied contradiction. The token gift costs him nothing visible; the woman’s tears pay the emotional price, so the cost is displaced, not felt by the agent. The characterization remains pleasant but does not earn a higher band because the decisive beat lacks a palpable personal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lira’s interiority is lyrical but remains consistent—her obsession with gaps, tides, and memory feels idiosyncratic. The moment she chooses rooted stillness over mobility crystallizes her arc with visible cost: “roots of energy extending from her feet.” Flaw: the Council and nostalgia ban are never embodied or opposed in-scene, so the external pressure stays abstract; the conflict is mostly symbolic. Still, the final renunciation is felt on the skin, earning the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is textured through glass-maker perception and dawn solitude, but her “noctilucent reckonings” remain abstract label-speak; the pond-stone moment supplies one embodied choice that crystallizes her stance, yet no secondary pressure tests her. The arc lands in CRR, yet the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized on her body or craft.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hard-soft embodiment is live in fingertips, breath, boot-crunch; interior contradiction (“he needed to enlighten not others, but himself”) drives every step. Micro-choice—lifting the box to moonlight—crystallizes hierarchy of values with visible cost. Flaw: no second character, so status crucible unused; reflection block >20% but anchored and tilt present stance. Closure renunciation earned by prior causality: the fracture accepted as deliberate stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s “logical dreamer” identity is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in contradictory impulse or risky miscalculation; the interiority is abstract (“logical mind warred with dreaming heart”) rather than dramatized. Micro-choices—positioning decorations, adjusting weights—are meticulous yet emotionally flat, so the promised fusion of logic/dream feels declared, not performed. The final shift is purely epiphanic, lacking an on-page mistake or renunciation that would cost him something visible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s curiosity and tactile engagement with the passage are vivid, but her interiority never knots into contradiction; the “weight of legacy” is announced, not dramatized through micro-choices that cost her anything. The final commitment reads as serene escalation rather than a stance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    The Painter’s calm endurance and inherited obligation feel lived-in; her borrowed heartbeat creates a visceral tether to the terrace. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she actively considers abandoning her post—so the renunciation costs less than it could. The lineage hand-off is summarized, not dramatized, muting the personal stakes. Still, her micro-touch on wet stone and the mirrored futures she confronts embody embodied, specific emotion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elian’s weariness and residual idealism register in concrete gestures—scuffed shoes, thumb-polished wood—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a visible, costly micro-choice during the treaty beats; the personal stake (“war had stolen their family”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the climactic signature feels earned by synopsis rather than by on-page tension. The operative gentleness is asserted repeatedly but never forces a trade-off we can watch. Result: credible silhouette, not yet crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—ruthless empire-builder vs. clandestine sentimentalist—are dramatized in the single continuous scene through the embodied act of kneeling on salt that burns his knees while cradling the egg. Interiority is concrete (“cool and perfect in his palm,” “chest tightening”) and never drifts into diagnostic labels. The final release is earned by the prior causal chain: he engineered the drought, studied the cracks, acquired the egg, and now surrenders it with whispered indigenous words that foreclose any future possession. Cost is visible: the egg vanishes, his boots leave no trace, and the rain erases his map—an Earned Stasis that seals his irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s interiority is lyric but thin; the “silver threads” and “echoes” are poetic placeholders rather than concrete, character-specific instruments. The bodily poetic form is asserted, never embodied—no tremor, sweat, or breath-pattern under threat. Her final step into the prism sanctuary is presented as transcendence, yet the cost is asserted (“she had preserved…her soul”) rather than dramatized. Still, the refusal of sexual commodification is a coherent, active stance that forecloses her old life, earning a mid-high score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s serenity is stated but never truly tested; we watch him perform but see no interior fracture under pressure. The “half-lit epiphanies” are announced rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses, so motivation stays flat. Because no micro-choice visibly costs him anything, the ending’s calm feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s grief-charged vocation is credibly embodied; the moth-wing ritual anchors contradictions between scientific detachment and devotional urgency. Interiority stays concrete (“warm flush of purpose”) and avoids diagnostic speak. The micro-choice to knot each silken thread as a generational proxy shows values in hierarchy, and the final renunciation—dawn will erase the signals—carries visible cost. Flaw: no second character means relationship crucible is N/A; head-count default met.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven quest is vivid and embodied in cold-cheek tears, but the interior contradiction—why a master caster needs a card template to braid—never surfaces. The “technically gentle” trait is asserted, not dramatized; the rope yields without resistance, so we see no genuine struggle or flaw in action. The renunciation (she stays as keeper) is legible and cost-bearing, yet the causal path to that choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled-with.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “foresight-hindsight-only” condition is embodied in every beat—her ritualized finger-work on the wafer, the dream logic, the final fusion of temporal planes—so motivation stays concrete. Interior contradiction is thin: we are told she is isolated by judgment, but that social wound never leaks into present-tense micro-choice under pressure. The earned moment of presence is paid for by lifelong absence, a visible cost, yet the absence of any secondary character keeps status dynamics and relationship-as-crucible off the page, capping fullness.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Anu’s frugality, mystic-scientist contradiction, and tactile micro-choices (saving clay, trembling fingers) stay embodied and coherent under rising pressure; the final covenant marks earned change with visible hand-symbols. Interiority slips once into thematic label (“dusky harmony in his soul”) but recovers. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Motivation clear, stakes scale to personal extinction, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marcus’s resentment is embodied early through the broken pin and dark aura, giving visceral stakes. Elara’s “scheming pacifist” premise is asserted rather than dramatized—she never schemes or faces a pacifist dilemma on-page; her manipulation is declarative (“I will convince you…”). The cellular-memory epiphany is delivered via guided visualization, not via a micro-choice that costs her anything. Brother’s eleventh-hour apparition is pure external grace; Marcus’s forgiveness is unearned by any prior visible struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mirror-maker’s contradictory impulses—yearning to “erase boundaries” while clinging to family ritual—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (polishing, breathing) that visibly cost tremoring hands and thirty lost years. Final surrender to the dream as navigator earns credible renunciation of capture; passivity in letting the creature settle keeps him from 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s curator identity is vivid, but interiority cycles ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet") without new contradictory impulse; micro-choice shifts from restraint to pursuit are present yet feel declared rather than embodied, so the cost of crossing the temporal threshold lands as concept more than felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motive—answering career-long linguistic puzzles via the rescue—remains abstract; we are told “ancient linguistic puzzles that had tormented her,” but neither the specific puzzle nor how the trapped scholar ties to it is dramatized. Interiority is atmospheric (“mind already calculating pathways”), not contradictory under pressure, and the final “silent promise” is a tidy after-image rather than a renunciation or crystallized cost. Micro-choices (negotiating, extracting) are present, yet the stakes stay external: the diary, not a personal blind spot, drives every beat, so the rescue feels professional, not crucible-tested. The interior contradiction required for 9-band is absent; the character works more as capable vessel than flawed agent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is lyric and specific (“homesick for lives she had never lived”), but the beat-work is thin: she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The climactic “pressing palm to tree” is passive reception, not active decision, so the Earned Stasis feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eleanor’s “warmly methodical” trait is shown through tactile kit-layout and braid-photography, but interior contradiction is thin: no moment where herArchive-orderliness collides with fear of vanishing. The final beat—facing Croft—lands as neat wish-fulfilment rather than a renunciation with visible cost; the emotional plateau feels safe, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is thin; we get duty (“preserve the ancient patterns”) but no contradictory impulse or embodied emotion while the cave is literally being torn apart. Micro-choices are reported (“they traced the pattern”) rather than lived; the moment of conjuring carries no visible cost or physical toll, so the final smile feels unearned. The single POV keeps the field clear, yet the character never surprises us or reveals a flaw that complicates the cure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her retrocognitive gift is shown through concrete star-mapping micro-choices, not label-speak. The flaw/burden link is repeatedly embodied (“her retrocognitively blessed mind already reaching backward”). The final renunciation—accepting the beacon’s fragile, temporary light—carries visible cost in her “trembling hands” and dawn descent. Missing is any secondary character to test status or relationship crucible, but within single-POV scope her arc is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elthion’s interiority is lyrically specific—“pre-emptively nostalgic heart” is a trait that drives every micro-choice from descending the stairs to pressing his ear to the crystal. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. accept loss) remain present but are voiced rather than dramatized in-scene, muting the cost. The final vow earns its inevitability yet the emotional price is stated, not embodied in trembling hand or ink-stained finger. One more kinetic beat of visible forfeiture would have lifted this to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority is lyrically sketched but never contradicts itself under pressure; the “serious playfulness” surfaces only in gesture, not in clashing wants. Missing: a micro-choice that visibly costs him something tangible—fuel, bodily safety, social capital—so the arc feels observed rather than paid for. The chant remains ornamental; it never forces a trade-off or error, so the “gravity of hopelessness” is defied by display, not by stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—scientific detachment versus ancestral talismanic faith—is rendered through tactile micro-choices: fingers on cicada, gaze on star-reflecting pools. The crisis of funding is met not with a grant request but with a stance crystallization that fuses vocation and legacy; the cost is visible when she accepts uncertainty as method. Warmly observant trait stays alive in how she notices silence between waves and Aris’s shifting expression. Final resolve is earned because every prior beat shows her avoiding direct confrontation; the pause becomes the data she needs.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and silence-hunger are viscerally embodied; the doll anchors her panic and later pairs with the vessel in a charged poise. The inversion ascent forces her to confront both fears, producing a credible renunciation of earth-dread. Internal contradiction is present but summarized rather than dramatized in scene—no moment shows her simultaneously yearning and terrified while acting. Still, the ending’s cost (loss of sky-silence, return to bunker) is legible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elias’s interiority stays concrete—his “fluidly logical mind” is repeatedly shown through micro-adjustments of prisms and the storm-glass reading. The contradiction between scientific control and empathic mission is quietly embodied, not declared. Cost is present but soft: he gives each passenger bespoke silence yet remains alone, a price felt in the final image of him resetting for the next transit. The characterization never flattens into guru cliché; his competence is balanced by the ephemeral, uncontrollable nature of the comfort he architects.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—her weathered fingers, the ruby’s warmth—but “wisely adventurous” is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged; every move feels pre-ordained by loreKeeper script. The renunciation at the throne is credible, yet the cost is more ritual than personal, keeping her just shy of 8-band interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shadow-keeper’s contradictory impulses—craving isolation yet answering the call—are dramatized through micro-actions (thumb on ring, rising from ash). Her scars ache, embodying the cost of past choices. The final hand-extension feels earned because every prior bridge-burning step is visible in the ashen dust she swept. Only the “someone barely breathing” remains a cipher, preventing full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s pyramid-scheme past is a sharp, embodied motive that seeds distrust of “promises,” and her decision to act on the glitchy texts is credibly mischievous‐virtuous. The interiority stays concrete (“survivor because she could see through illusions”) rather than label-speak. Yet her moment of change—pressing the bolt into the plate—relies on a late, abstract rule rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything visible on the page; the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Character beat is clean, but the emotional price at the climax feels soft, capping the arc just short of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    Interior contradiction appears only in one beat (“his heart steady despite the momentous discovery”). Otherwise the POV is calm, competent, untested; no visible flaw complicates the crank-turning. The final choice—pocket the parchment—carries no on-page cost or risk, so the arc flattens into efficient victory rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization. Voice remains atmospheric but character-specific idiom is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Galen’s interiority is evocative—“shivering bliss,” “unspoken knowledge”—but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final stance is foreshadowed, yet the cost is asserted (“something within Galen had changed”) rather than embodied. Micro-choices are missing at the moment of unsnapping; we are told he “surrendered” but not what he forfeits on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eleanor’s interior contradiction—grief-seeking solitude yet compulsively documenting kindness—drives every beat; the button find crystallizes her need to matter. Her embodied reaction (“tactfully hopeful as always”) is repeated label-speak without new micro-choice, blunting peak emotion. Benjamin’s forty-year arc is summarized, not dramatized, so his “gentle hands” gesture never gets pressure-tested on the page. Closure works as mutual Earned Stasis: both accept institutional solitude with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minor therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s quiet-archivist cover and phone-booth-key obsession give her a crisp, specific edge; her micro-choice to trust the puddle-map shows trait-consistent risk-taking. Interiority leans on stock rebel shorthand (“tyranny of indifference”) rather than embodied contradiction, so the deeper emotional cost feels announced, not dramatized. Theodor is sketched only as trembling exposition, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is missing. Still, her final grin of grim continuation earns a credible endurance stance that forecloses rest, satisfying the closure-cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    Ethan’s motive—to cancel the prophecy with anti-music—is concrete and idiosyncratic, but interiority stays at a decorative distance (“eerie nostalgia,” “quietly vivid anticipation”) rather than revealing contradictory impulses in scene. The climax is a pure sensation (“he felt it happen”) rather than a micro-choice that costs him anything visible; the victory feels declared, not earned. Still, the occupation-driven perception and the refusal to speak the code aloud keep the portrait above generic. The missing bodily cost and the abstract final beat limit the arc to competent rather than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s obsession with order is vivid in her seed-sorting ritual, but the interiority stays ornamental—no contradictory impulse ever forces a visible trade-off. The “emerges transformed always” trait is asserted, not dramatized; we watch colors stain her skin rather than feel a cost that could foreclose an option. Because the final transformation is gentle inevitability rather than renunciation, the arc satisfies but does not sear.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—precision obsession vs. creeping attraction to uncertainty—is embodied in every micro-choice (scraping vines, pocketing gears). The final renunciation of perfect repair is earned by the cascading beats with the compass and waterfall clocks; cost is felt when he abandons his old tools as measuring devices and accepts “living” rhythm. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets skipped. Voice stays coherent, but one hedge: “uncertainly certain” skirts diagnostic-speak and slightly blurs embodied motive at the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief and need to redeem himself stay legible; his micro-choice to re-forge rather than replace the coin shows interior contradiction. Emotion stays embodied in grit, furnace heat, and the burn of etched copper. The final renunciation of perfection for "imperfect beauty" is earned by the prior failure montage. No genuine status interplay (single POV), so relationship crucible bullets are waived; interiority alone carries the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid—his sister’s memory drives every micro-choice (crocodile-tooth tilt, bell shake). The final renunciation of Thomas’s shame is earned by this back-story pressure and costs Elias another fragment of his own lingering grief, visible in the warming tooth. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ bar is missed, but motivation stays coherent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kai’s embodied trauma responses and micro-choices (tracing the strap, bracing against the tree, removing the mask) keep interiority concrete; the “mathematics of mercy” want is stated early and re-energized by the final algorithmic insight. The strap’s tactile reprise and the forest’s UV logic force two visible trade-offs—knees buckling under memory, then surrendering the strap—so endurance carries cost. No contradictory impulses appear side-by-side, but the interior monologue flirts with therapy-speak (“proprioceptively enhanced awareness”) that slightly flattens peak embodiment. Closure is an earned renunciation of the strap, foreclosing old survival tactics with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The translator’s interiority stays lyric and atmospheric; we feel awe but not contradictory want/fear. The grandmother’s deathbed cue supplies motive, yet the present-tense choice—touch fragment to painting—arrives as declaration, not pressured micro-choice. No visible cost or irreversible path is foreclosed; the “eternal instant” feels luminous rather than risky. Voice is consistent, but character under pressure reads more witness than agent.

    Marcus’s ghost-seeing is label-only until late; his “skillfully observant” trait stays ornamental. The decisive act—lifting the barrel to seal the cracks—arrives without prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives, so cost feels conceptual rather than earned. Interiority is vivid (“weightless burden”) but never contradictory under pressure. Closure leans on Charged Poise, not a hierarchy of values tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eldon’s obsession is vividly anchored in bodily memory (ink-stained fingers) and loss, but the interior contradiction—preserve vs destroy—stays summary. The final “both preserved and destroyed” is declared, not dramatized with a visible renunciation gesture; cost is felt but not embodied in a micro-choice we can see.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s poetically inclined interiority is vivid and embodied (“traced his fingers”, “whispered to the shard”), but the decisive shift to public peacemaker relies on a single overnight writing sprint whose causal steps are summarized, not dramatized; the cost is asserted (“burned brighter”) rather than shown through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s gentle craftsman persona is consistent, but interiority stays ornamental—“a lullaby woven from dreams and starlight” tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. His single micro-choice—humming the lullaby—does carry cost, yet the emotional stakes read abstract because we never feel his body or a moment of genuine doubt; the stone’s glow substitutes for embodied tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s contradiction—scientific collector chasing the ineffable—drives every beat; the “sensibly eccentric” label is embodied in her calm breach of the lagoon, felt cost in the final smile at childhood rain. Interiority stays specific: compass heat, primordial dark, “hinged awakening” voiced only once, never explained. Final renunciation—bottling impossibility, not petrichor—pays off thirty-year obsession with visible conceptual cost. No second character on page; relationship/status bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—“spirited,” “perpetually learning” are shown via her tactile slide-handling and driftwood choices, not merely labeled. Yet the pivotal shift from lost tourist to time-witness relies on a single epiphanic paragraph (“understood now that the archway was more than stone”) rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page; the stance change is declared, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse competes with her awe, so the arc feels smooth but not pressured. Still, her sculptor’s eye constrains every perception, keeping voice individual and flaw present in her technophilic helplessness.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority remains painterly and consistent, but Elara’s contradiction never sharpens into a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page; the revelation is received, not enacted. No persistent flaw complicates her tactics—she simply “notices” the answer. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost isconceptual rather than lived, keeping the arc just shy of high-band earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ellara’s interiority is concrete—she traces diary spines, tastes tear-gas, fingers tremble—showing embodied contradiction under pressure. Her micro-choice to kneel and spell messages with debris crystallizes values; the cost (daily return to the lagoon) is visible. One slip: “searing reverie of human complexity” edges into label-speak, blunting peak emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elior’s interior contradiction—clinging to alchemical patience while craving communal rebirth—drives every beat, but his final leap from hermit to civic architect is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost (loneliness, ridicule risk) is named, not dramatized, so the renunciation feels efficient rather than paid in blood.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic—the “wax cool against weathered skin” and the velvet disquiet sensation make Elias specific. Contradictory impulses (archive vs. act) are present, but the final shift to city-wide preservation is declared more than dramatized; we see the resolve, not the cost paid yet. Still, the emotional stakes scale believably for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Anya’s interiority is granular and embodied—bare feet on frost, the acorn cap warming against skin—while her contradictory impulses (cataloguing vs. touching) coexist in-scene. The micro-choice to reorder seeds by dormancy length, not type, crystallizes her hierarchy of values under mortal pressure, and the final renunciation (touching, not collecting) costs her lifelong identity as saver. No stock therapeutic labels; her flaw (obsessive preservation) directly enables and complicates the climax. The only tick is a hairline slip toward abstraction at “texture of borrowed time was none other than the texture of herself,” but the cost is still felt through her trembling hand.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—“weathered fingers along the fibers,” listening to timber creaks—and his credulous curiosity is dramatized in the rerouting of the bell. The only flaw is a slight drift toward diagnostic self-summary (“his motivation was simple yet profound”) that momentarily abstracts the man in the moment of triumph. Still, his single-minded attention and the final smile land a credible renunciation of digital noise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elion’s spiritual curiosity is stated repeatedly but never manifests as a contradictory impulse under pressure; all “choices” are calm observations until the final walk into the void, which is un-opposed. The glass handle is handled twice, yet its use never forces a trade-off or reveals a blind spot. Interiority drifts into textbook awe (“flourishing stillness,” “cosmic consciousness”) rather than embodied, idiosyncratic sensation. No cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page—he returns “forever changed” but the story shows no before/after difference in action or status.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The recluse’s renunciation of speech is dramatized through embodied gesture and repeated micro-choices (placing the box, sitting in silence). Interiority stays concrete—“they cradled a tangible manifestation”—and the final stance is earned by the causality of listening. Yet the character’s one-way relationship with ghosts never forces a reciprocal status shift, so the “relationship as crucible” bullet is moot and the arc skirts the razor edge of perfect stillness without visible flaw-cost until the bee dissolves. That dissolution is lovely but too weightless to register as bodily price, keeping this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s motive—“to understand the texture of time”—is stated repeatedly yet never dramatized as a visceral hunger; she decodes, embeds, and smiles, but no contradictory impulse or visible cost disturbs her arc. The urn fragment warms in her palm as if approving, a gift rather than a test, so her final “earned” stance feels foregiven, not fought for. Interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“time was hers to explore…a comfort, a guide, a friend”) that flattens tension instead of revealing new limits. The piece offers a serene Charged Poise, but the absence of flaw-driven friction keeps the change from feeling paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The poet’s interiority is textured—“finding the music in crashing waves and still pools” shows contradictory impulses in scene—but she never makes a consequential micro-choice under pressure; the snapped kite is observed, not interacted with. No relationship crucible or status shift is on-page, so the cap for “secondary pressure” is waived, yet her arc still lacks a fork where cost is felt. Motivation is declared (“discover beauty in the incomplete”) rather than dramatized through forfeiture or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s calm is stated repeatedly but never contradicted internally; no embodied friction or micro-choice shows why this trait matters under mortal pressure. His final act is foregone, not wrestled with, so the “earned” closure feels administered rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elian’s “luminous skeptic” tag is asserted, not dramatized; the only micro-choice—ignoring the spiral detour—barely pressures him. Interiority slips into abstract labels (“chemistry of homecoming”) without embodied contradiction. Cost is asserted in the final line (“no longer a skeptic”) but never paid on-page; the amber does the work, not him.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman's motivation is anchored early and stays consistent, his interiority is concrete (seed-pod counting, bird-call translations). Interior contradictions are implied rather than dramatized in-scene, and the only micro-choice we witness is the scattering itself—no second option is ever risked, so the cost is more atmospheric than personal. The final smile is earned but feels gentle rather than staked; a sharper renunciation or visible fatigue would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s bloodhound past is credibly internalized: the “nose once found the lost and the final” becomes a perceptual signature that guides every beat. His micro-choices—leaf against sun, northeast pivot—are concrete, embodied, and carry visible cost (days of thirst, scrapes, solitary miles). The interior contradiction—tracker longing for home vs. exile—stays active in scene, not summary. Closure is earned: the same senses that once located corpses now locate living refuge; the price is the lifetime of death-scent memory he carries into the valley.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—she “closed her eyes briefly” to trigger the glimpse, a bodily cue that externalizes her gift. The contradiction between isolation and sacred duty is vivid, but the arc is primarily declarative (“now she understood”) rather than shown through a late micro-choice that forecloses a path. No embodied cost (tremor, hesitation) is granted to the final beat; the insight arrives as label. Still, her perceptual signature is sustained and individuated, satisfying the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s curiosity and “chivalrous thief” code are declared early and his micro-choice to pocket the king piece before the master’s reveal shows an internal contradiction on the page. Yet the theft motive stays abstract (“he knew their secrets would be needed”) and the promised moral tension—stealing vs amending—never complicates tactics; no hesitation or cost is dramatized. Emotion is performance-oriented (“heart both racing and calm”) and the final nod feels like tidy affirmation rather than a stance with visible price. Earned stasis is present but lightly; the closure beat could gain if the theft code collided with fixing time.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “benevolently ruthless” historian drive is dramatized through the obsessive floor-spelling walks and the tactile moment she touches the lone pawn; the interior contradiction between gentleness and ferocity is present but stays at summary level until the final beat, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maven’s yearning for “the shape of home” is vivid and embodied in her nightly feather ritual, but the interior contradiction between passive drifting and active world-shaping is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final epiphany feels lightly earned because no prior choice visibly risks or costs her anything.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The exiled tutor’s contradictory impulses—arrogance vs. penance—are dramatized in the micro-movements on the tapestry threads; his body remembers the prince’s death while his fingers rehearse restitution. Interiority is concrete (trembling fingers, unrecognizable reflection) rather than diagnostic. The final gesture of accepting the prince’s hand crystallizes a credible renunciation of self-loathing; the cost is the forty years lived in frozen silence, felt in the single bell toll.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “innocently mischievous” trait is asserted often but never dramatized through risky on-page choices; her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“truth cannot be contained”) that tells us her defiance rather than showing a contradictory impulse under pressure. The promised sacrifice stays abstract—no moment where she flinches or re-values the cost—so the final smile feels unearned. Micro-choices are missing at the crucial tipping point; we get crowd scenes instead of a single, costly decision that forecloses her escape.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcel’s interiority is rich and embodied; his trembling palm, weathered fingertips, and deliberate breath-hold make uncertainty visceral. The brass charm’s pulse against his chest externalizes memory-work without label-speak. The final shift from erasing to gilding damage is earned through tactile tracing and costs him the illusion of perfect repair. Only minus: no second character means relationship crucible unused, but that is within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—aching to preserve beauty yet aloof from people—remains palpable in every brushstroke and pocketed shell. Emotion is embodied (trembling fingers, blurred vision) rather than labeled. The final endurance—painting the masterpiece while knowing memory will still fade—carries visible cost and crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Micro-choices (wrong turn, pocketing shell, setting easel) all tilt present stance; no stock therapeutic self-talk intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s longing for his lost sister is concrete from the first paragraph; the whispered vial test is a visible micro-choice that risks Captain Morgan’s scorn. His embodied reaction—tears of “screaming tenderness”—pays off the internal contradiction between gentleness and intensity. The sister’s off-stage moment of recognition is too summarized to let us feel her cost, but his cost is palpable. Motivation stays consistent and the vial cork becomes a charged talisman, earning the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and particular—navigator’s “weathered lips” unfamiliar with smiling, scars as landmarks, eyes that “had seen too many wrecks.” Contradictory impulses co-exist: pride in guiding souls home vs. sorrow over past wrecks, shown in the same beat. Final micro-choice—pressing fingers to burning bronze while whispering “Welcome home”—is earned by six months of solitary vigil and costs a physical burn, visible on page. Voice remains distinct, never drifts into diagnostic label-speak; every trait is shown through handling of censer, charts, transmitter.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s rational, methodical vocation is lived-in—her fork-work, velvet pouch, textbook trade, and storm timing all flow from truffle-forger logic. The empathy virus is shown through bodily cost (tears, voice cracking) and drives every micro-choice; her recitation list grows from solitude and prior failures. Interior contradiction is present—she clings to science yet gambles on “discredited” lore—and the second eye discovery crystallizes her shift from defense to outreach with a visible smile. Only minor slack: the names recited are told-summary, not dramatized contacts, muting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s loneliness, ritualized observation, and reluctant surrender to another man’s grief are vividly embodied; the borrowed memories force micro-choices (silent pauses, returning to the dock) that visibly cost him ease-of-mind. Internal contradiction—craving isolation yet accepting communion—peaks when he mimics the gesture, earning a quiet renunciation of his earlier self. The eccentric-keeper trait stays alive in brass spectacles, star-talk, logbooks; never drifts into generic hermit. No second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets skipped; still, the mirror-relationship with the vanished stranger drives the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his haptic reading of the matrix chip, the ache of “paths not taken” as literal doors. The renunciation of inherited loneliness is earned: the ants, the creek, the chip all pressure him toward a self-chosen solitude. One beat of embodied contradiction—hand steady while pulse races—would have nudged this into 8.5. Flaw: late label “self-revelation” abstracts what the body has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s disenchantment is shown through concrete withdrawal—dismissing guards, choosing climbing leathers—and the interior contradiction between crown-duty and dream-urgency is felt in her muscles on the rock. The reflection-swap in the pool dramatizes her buried self, giving the renunciation of the “gilded cage” a visible cost. Maera functions mainly as mythic facilitator, so status crucible is off-stage, and the final ascent does not test new flaws; still, the earned return to court with secret strength lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scientific precision vs. romantic hunger—drives every beat; the secret’s weight forces a visible shift in her artistic hierarchy. Leo remains a silhouette, but his mere presence supplies the relational pressure that crystallizes her re-prioritization. The nautilus shell acts as both heirloom and tool, its spiral literalizing the “return differently” method. Cost is felt: she abandons safe preservation for the risk of capturing mutable human density.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s lucid-dream chronicler identity is vivid—his trembling fingertip on the scroll, envy of naïve past selves, and final micro-choice to roll the scroll and keep writing all embody a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction (yearning for ignorance while despising it) is present, but the embodied cost is more atmospheric than tactile; no concrete forfeiture is dramatized. Closure reaches Charged Poise, not Earned Stasis, so the motivational arc feels complete yet not physically costly. Slight over-reliance on abstract labels (“jaded wonder,” “feral nostalgia”) keeps this just below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interiority is specific—tactile reading of the screw, the felt absence of scent—but her shift to “warmth” at the end is asserted, not embodied. The midwife trainee is sketched more by role than contradiction. Micro-choices (returning the screw, waving Lena in) align with her new vocation, yet no real cost or foreclosed path is dramatized; the emotional beat feels softly resolved rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling fingers, the held breath, the memory of soil—but the crystallization affliction is label-only until the fingertip prickle, so the stakes never feel bodily. The grandmother voice is invoked twice yet produces no contradictory impulse or new knowledge; it calms rather than complicates. The final “work perfectly executed” is declared, not dramatized, so the cost of converting scars into warnings is asserted rather than felt. Still, her micro-choice to keep breathing while the platform tilts shows a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    Eloise’s guilt and need for apology are clear, but her interiority slips into poetic self-label (“wilderness of my conscience”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The embodied moment when her trembling hand removes the glasses is strong, yet the prior motive for publishing the scandal is asserted, not shown under pressure. Beatrice’s forgiveness is moving, but its weight rests on a single line of dialogue rather than a prior micro-choice that would make the apology feel earned. Stakes rise, yet the character’s genuine struggle is intermittently abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    The witness is a luminous consciousness rather than a person; interiority is atmospheric, not conflicted. No contradictory impulses or embodied emotion appear; the stakes are cosmic, not personal. The only micro-choice—laying the dictionary on the altar—arrives as ordained ritual, not fraught decision. Characterization is therefore conceptually evocative but lacks the on-page cost or change demanded for high-band credit.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    Arlo’s interiority is vivid—“fingers carefully avoiding the razor edges,” “fjord quiet that had grown too loud”—and his lifelong urge to *hear* clocks gives clear, idiosyncratic motive. Contradictory impulses (safety vs. metaphysical hunger) operate simultaneously as he turns the key against resistance. The final vow to wear the key as talisman shows earned renunciation with felt cost: he abandons conventional time-keeping. What keeps the score from climbing higher is the absence of relational pressure or secondary character friction to test these motives under external fire.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority stays specific to her spatial gift—she “maps every contour of light and shadow” rather than “feels awe.” The laser pointer becomes an extension of her perceptual lens, not a gadget. Her shift from intrusion hunter to boundary-weaver is visible in the near-touch beat, where the permeable barrier literalizes her earned ambivalence. Micro-choices (adjusting laser parameters, stepping out) accumulate into a stance crystallization with felt cost: she forfeits the safety of pure defense.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s contradictory motives—mathematical rigor vs. father-haunted empathy—are declared early and re-surface in micro-choices (copying the seat numbers, deciding the scrawls are “invitations,” packing the lantern). Interiority is mostly textured, but a few abstractions (“clover melancholy,” “the odds favor those who understand the game”) edge toward label-speak rather than embodiment. No secondary character on-page, so relationship bullets N/A; the earned stasis in the final paragraph lands because we’ve seen her nightly pilgrimages accumulate. Flaws and misbeliefs (intellectual pride, filial guilt) complicate the final peace without tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elias’s grief-driven withdrawal and the slow pivot from isolation to re-engagement are credible, but his “peculiar” motive (“to teach endings how to begin again”) is stated rather than dramatized; no concrete micro-choice on the page enacts that pedagogy. Interiority is atmospheric yet drifts toward abstraction (“melodically haunted,” “cultivated estrangement”) that tells us the emotional label rather than embodying contradiction. The one actionable beat—answering Meredith’s call—originates from the disc, not from an interior impulse that visibly costs him anything, so the final stance feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.7)
    The archivist’s contradictory blend of haunted nostalgia and quiet scientific mastery is embodied in the ritual of mixing flower-powders with walnut ink; his interiority is specific, tactile, and charged by loss. Motivation—preserving “the weight of small moments”—is repeatedly anchored to micro-choices (timing the ninety-second steep, sealing the vial) and to the locket photo, so the final renunciation carries visible cost. Flaws are present but not dramatized into error; the piece leans on elegiac stillness rather than active mistake-making, slightly blunting edge. Even so, the stance crystallization is earned and particular to this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Archie’s loneliness and compulsive joviality are vividly embodied; the moon-rock keepsake gives his isolation a concrete tether. Yet the transition from “distribute aid” to “fabricate lunar cult” feels like a motivations leap rather than a pressured evolution—no visible micro-choice shows him deciding deception is worth risking his ethical code. The final beat accepts cost (“they’d never know his name”) but the interior contradiction that might have sharpened that renunciation is stated, not dramatized. Still, his voice, gesture palette, and the flaw/competence balance stay individual and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elion’s grief-blindness nexus is embodied in every tactile beat; the ring’s warming against skin, the braille-notes pressing his palms, and the final kneel where tears fall sightlessly all tether interiority to action. The contradiction between cartographic mastery and emotional disorientation is kept live in scene, not summarised. The earned shift—from seeking an external stillpoint to carrying an internal one—pays the visible cost of tears and the foreclosed path of perpetual grief. Only the mentor memory remains slightly abstract; a single sensory flash would have tipped this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s guilt-propelled determination is clear, but the interior contradiction—her “confidently uncertain” stance—remains label-level until the final paragraph. The pen’s inherited power and her solitary ritual give her a concrete, idiosyncratic lens, yet her emotional texture thins in the mid-section where reflection outweighs micro-choice. The closing renunciation (“promise to the universe”) is earned, but the visible cost is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—his hunger to “map” others and his acceptance of erasure—stay active in scene, but the interiority tilts toward lyrical summary (“joyful sorrow” repeated) rather than fresh embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (camera angle, hand-shape) do charge each beat, and the final renunciation of being remembered is earned, yet the emotional diction edges toward diagnostic label-speak at peak, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s contradictory librarian/arsonist identity is embodied early (“her arsonist’s mind”) and drives every micro-choice; the moment she restores the portrait using fire knowledge crystallizes the flaw→redemption arc with felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, never generic (“volcanic tenderness” is a rare lapse). The final self-portrait reveal is earned: we watched her sketch replicas, handle tapestries, decide to stay underground—each action forecloses return to above-ground life. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A; single-POV interiority remains distinct and pressure-calibrated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her finger-drumming, window-ledge perch, and lagoon obsession are specific—but the “quiet rebellion” is declared more than dramatized after the escape beat; no micro-choice shows her risking new cost once Theo appears, so the renunciation feels assumed rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marlo’s “uncanny ability to identify people's walks” is shown twice (evading inspectors; detecting Vance), grounding his competence. His micro-choice—whispering directions five minutes early—reveals a hierarchy of values: subterfuge over confrontation. The zodiac coin and key function as tactile extensions of his superstition and self-reliance, handled under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of actual risk (exposure to Vance) is summarized rather than lived, blunting the cost of his gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Guardian’s “spiralingly calm” is vivid but static; no interior contradiction surfaces under pressure. Visitor’s half-secret never presses a decision, so the emotional cost stays abstract. The final nod is too slight to register as earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arthur’s interiority is concrete—his gift of hearing unspoken thoughts is shown through specific whispers (“Why must we do everything this way?”) that tilt his stance. The micro-choice to use the grotto amplifies his ability and foreshadows the plan. His final smile is a credible renunciation of silence, paid for by three weeks of secrecy. One slip: “forests of second thoughts” is used three times without fresh embodiment, a faint echo of label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s longing is rendered through lyrical, embodied images (“weight of her former self slipping away”) rather than stock labels, and the culminating dive conveys credible renunciation. Yet her interior contradiction—dock-worker duty versus dream of elsewhere—is stated more than dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice (pressing the scrimshaw to her chest) carries most motivational weight and could use an earlier beat of visible resistance or risk to earn the leap. Still, the arc from guarded to unguarded feels individual and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—public theatrical narration vs. private blankness—is vivid and embodied in the micro-gesture of touching a brittle petal. His motive (lightness in grief) drives every whittling beat and is visibly costed by the flakes of wood and petals he loses. The endurance/renunciation closure is earned: he refuses to sell the figures, accepting perpetual solitude as price. Only flaw: no second on-page character means relationship crucible and status dynamics are absent by scope, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The poet’s transformation from observer to participant is dramatized through tactile contact with the quartz, but the interior contradiction—yearning for freedom yet fearing dissolution—is stated rather than embodied. No micro-choice after the touch shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the shift into pure shadow-being is lyrical assertion, not tested want-versus-fear. The “tremor of certainty” functions as label-only interiority, missing the diagnostic-speak penalty window yet still too abstract to earn the epiphany. Closure renunciation is present (they leave to teach others), yet the price of leaving the colonnade’s shelter is never staged or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s color-blind painter identity and “innocently cunning” trait are shown through her silent plant choreography and the deliberate trade for Gideon’s awakening; her interiority stays concrete, tied to touch and tone. The micro-choice to surrender her single valuable token is embodied, not labeled, and her own unexpected color-return lands as earned stasis. Status dynamics with Gideon are legible: she kneels, he trembles, power tilts. No contradiction under pressure, but the “innocently cunning” friction is more asserted than tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prism-song bell ringer’s motive—“to discover the texture of connection”—is stated repeatedly yet never tested by an opposing want or external pressure; interiority stays abstract (“feeling the sound wash over her”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice risks anything tangible, so the final smile feels unearned. The absence of stakes or cost keeps motivation declarative, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s grief is sketched in stock phrases (“hollow and adrift,” “subdued ardor”) rather than embodied contradiction; she never makes a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. The stencil and origami function as props, not pressure points. The promised arc from “withering to bloom” is asserted, not dramatized; the ending offers stasis, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias's interiority is textured—ink-stained fingers, reverence for the tape—but his contradictory impulses stay mostly stated (“he hesitated only a moment”) rather than dramatized. The visitor remains a silhouette; no status tension or divergent speech patterns under pressure. The inherited-cost idea lands as theme, not as a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible price. Earned stasis is implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is vivid—“anguish and joy that had become her constant companion”—but remains abstract; no bodily signature beyond “pulse beneath her fingers.” The final merging is declared, not dramatized: “she realized she was becoming part of the archive” tells the cost instead of showing a perceptual break or surrender of agency. Motivation is clear yet static; her stance at the end is identical to the opening obsession, only intensified. The absence of micro-choices under pressure keeps the arc from earning a full character shift.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s grief-driven vigil is credibly internalized; the river-stone touch and late recognition give embodied cost. Still, her “shape of hope” motive is stated more than pressure-tested, and the friend-shadow never complicates her stance mid-scene—she watches, then mourns. The final endurance carries poignancy, but micro-choice under escalating risk is missing. Characterization is solid, not quite crucible-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“her own wounded spirit” parallels the chameleon’s tail—but the promised internal contradiction between self-respect and compassion is stated more than dramatized; no scene-level micro-choice visibly enacts the trade-off, so the arc leans reflective rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s “closure-seeker who reopens wounds” is declared repeatedly yet never dramatized; she never confronts a person whose scar she has probed. The moment she decides to stop seeking closure is reported, not embodied: “she realized she could stop seeking closure.” Plant-telepathy trait is label-only—no cost, contradiction, or sensory bleed. Interiority slips into self-diagnosis (“her accidental telepathy…always a gift and burden”) and therapeutic tag-lines, weakening contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is sensorially rich—her fingers “feeling for subtle vibrations,” her mind “mapping hidden spaces”—and her motive (to incubate/release stored love) stays legible. However, the story never lets her make a true micro-choice that costs her anything; she simply receives visions and then promises to “give you voice again,” so the arc is observational rather than crucible-tested. The contradiction that could power conflict (her own unused love vs. the ghosts’) is named but not enacted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not type.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s “seeing but unable to create” paralysis is dramatized in tactile beats: her fingers on the brass dials, the instrument’s weight as embodiment of stalled agency. The internal contradiction—gifted perception vs. artistic impotence—stays active in scene, not summary. Her final micro-choices (tracing invisible lines, pocketing the notebook) convincingly enact the shift from drowning in input to filtering beauty; the cost is her bittersweet recognition of lost years. Single-POV interiority remains specific and sensorial; no diagnostic self-talk or stock epiphanies mar the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    The guard’s motivation—cultivating sparks—remains abstract; no concrete contradiction or embodied emotion is dramatized. His “dreamless” trait is asserted but never tested by a moment where a dream almost intrudes, so the promised interior tension stays off-stage. The Archivist’s sudden appearance supplies status pressure, yet the guard’s micro-choice in response is summary, not shown. Closure hinges on a single tick of the chess clock, a symbolic pivot that the guard’s prior agency does not visibly earn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaelen’s lone-philosopher hunger is vivid—“motivation burned bright”—and the gear-warmth gives him tactile, embodied drive. Interiority stays concrete: “wind through pine, oak, and birch” anchors thought in sensory bias. Final gear-placing is a clear, earned micro-choice that forecloses wandering and costs the solitary home he just mapped. Could use one visible flaw or contradiction under pressure to hit 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maris’s interiority is poetically coherent—her palm against silver, the shoreline lullaby inside her ears—but the collective “guides” remain interchangeable masks; no individual contradiction or micro-choice surfaces until the star-stamp burns her own skin. That final self-marking is the first credible, embodied cost, earning the quiet renunciation of passenger service for dragon-cradling; until then motivation is atmospheric rather than agentive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bellhop’s contradictory impulses—his yearning for music versus his acceptance of silence—are dramatized in the bolt-tracing beat and climaxing in his sung note; the cost of rupturing the fortress’s protection is felt in the sudden warmth of stone against still-numb fingers. Interiority stays concrete via tactile detail rather than label-speak. The decision to sing is credibly earned because the bolt’s etchings prove the fortress preys on musicians, making endurance more costly than revolt. Flaw: the “choir jacket” is mentioned once as back-story costume; it never constrains action or returns, so profession lacks micro-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is evocative—her thousand-year eyes, the ink pooling in her palm—but the decisive turn (pretender = her fear) is announced rather than dramatized through micro-choice; the moment she “realizes” lacks an on-page action that costs her something tangible. Still, her embodied emotion (“small frame radiating power”) and the renunciation of crown-not-wanted supply credible earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marina’s grief-anchored vigil rings true; the salt-sting memory at twelve and the nightly tapping give her a perceptual signature. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and her endurance at the end is a credible renunciation with cost. Yet she never makes a true micro-choice under pressure; the epiphany arrives as data-pattern recognition rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The lack of on-page action or risk keeps her just inside observational territory.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is lyrically sustained, but her transformation is declared (“now she understood that she was the meaning”) rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her something visible. The opera glasses fall, yet this is shrugged off; no contradictory impulse complicates her ascent to “regal” stance, so the change feels lightly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya’s insurgent streak and plant-telepathy are vivid, but the interior contradiction between scoffing at prophecy and embracing “implanted destiny” is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final acceptance feels smoothed rather than wrested. Embodied emotion is strong (weathered hands on rock, warmth of amber), yet the micro-choice to speak the script is not framed as a genuine risk or forfeiture—no visible cost or fear of failure—so the Earned Stasis is only half-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s contradictory impulses—clutching the photo yet releasing it—play out on the page; the final renunciation is earned by the somatic ritual we’ve watched graft love and loss together. Interiority stays concrete (“clenched jaw = rising panic” learned via earth-touch). Only flaw: “diagnostic label-speak” sneaks in (“intrusive memories”) without immediate embodied cost, a hairline slip that keeps her just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is textured—charcoal-stained fingers, the spiral of the lighthouse walls—but her “loss of soul” is stated more than dramatized. The tarot-and-thread ritual supplies a micro-choice sequence that finally externalizes conflict, yet the turn feels therapeutic rather than costly. No credible flaw or contradiction is tested; the recovery arrives as a mood shift, not a renunciation with price.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is concrete (“serene anger that belied calm”) and embodied in action; childhood trauma motive is named but never dramatized, so the final epiphany feels generalized rather than paid for by prior micro-choices. The disappearance beat shows visible cost (gasping, glowing hair) yet the core flaw—why risking erasure answers the childhood question—remains asserted, not dramatized. Still, the POV’s sensory albinism and isolation read as lived, not label-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her breath stabilizers racing against her pulse crystallizes the moment—but the “bravely conflicted” label is repeated instead of shown through fresh contradiction. The leap from loyal archivist to global whistle-blower happens in a single paragraph; we get no intermediate micro-choice that lets us feel the hinge inside her. Cost is named (cryonic suspension) yet not embodied before she sits down to wait, so the renunciation feels partly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rhiannon’s interiority is textured—her perceptual overload is shown through rose-care micro-moves—and her refusal-of-violence stance is embodied in the seed-pouch beat. Yet the因果 chain from “father scoffed” to her present resolve is told, not dramatized, so the cost of that renunciation feels asserted rather than earned. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the arc is a single steady note of tranquil nurture. Still, the specificity of her attention keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fisher’s cool-headed patience is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—each zig, each silent utterance—so his interiority stays concrete. The rail spike as tactile anchor, the net of transliterated feelings, and the final earned smile all show a hierarchy of values (understanding > glory) with visible cost. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, however; the arc is steady rather than torn, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor’s motivation is legible—finish father’s work, clear Davies—but interiority drifts into label-speak (“devotedly observant eyes,” “hierarchy of values”) that blurs embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows her flaw or cost; the turn from regret to justice is declared, not dramatized. The rosewood nib is handled, yet never alters her tactics or betrays a limit. Closure choice is summary, not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s guilt-deafness link is vivid; the embodied micro-choice to rewire firmware via amber shows contradiction in scene. Interiority avoids label-speak, but the beat of “tears streamed” is generic; still, the final tattooed-notes gesture earns a stasis with cost. Daughter’s voice as off-page catalyst is acceptable at this length, though it flirts with convenient echo. No status/secondary on-page, so single-POV crucible holds.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s trait of social perceptiveness is announced, not dramatized in micro-choices; the mandala pivot is lovely but we never see him weigh conflicting impulses or pay a concrete price for his “interjection.” Interiority drifts toward label-speak (“lilac unease,” “collective acceptance”) rather than embodied, moment-to-moment contradiction. The renunciation at closure is present yet feels foregone because no alternative path is made legible and painful to forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingers “tracing,” the tessera “warming”—and his contradictory impulse to mourn yet rebuild is held in scene. The final micro-choice (placing the tile, whispering “Samarkhand”) is motivated by every prior beat; the cost is the emotional exposure of standing alone in the ashes while others watch. No diagnostic label-speak; compassion is shown through tactile ritual, not abstract assertion. Flaw: the “gentle radical” tag is asserted twice rather than revealed through friction with on-page dissenters.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.7)
    Silas’s yearning for “encores that could never end” is stated repeatedly but never crystallizes into a contradictory interior moment; the synesthetic gift is colorful label-work rather than a pressure-forced flaw. His final dissolution is graceful yet cost-free: no visible relinquishment of a live option, no embodied tension between staying and going. Character depth stalls at atmospheric nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s “affectionate skeptic” duality is stated repeatedly but never dramatized in a moment where she must act against type; the interior monologue stays safely diagnostic (“her affectionate skepticism had evolved into determined conviction”) instead of showing simultaneous contradictory impulses. Her brother’s suffering is the stated engine, yet no concrete memory or sensory cue of him intrudes to twist her gut mid-experiment; heart-rate sync is reported, not felt. The single micro-choice—packing the sliver at dawn—arrives only after the experimental beats have already succeeded, so it registers as aftermath rather than costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s early-awakening gift and compulsion to “become the voice of the unknown” are stated, not dramatized; interiority drifts into therapeutic self-labeling (“she finally understood…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The fossil-touch epiphany is vivid, yet the decision to carry it out reads as pre-approved destiny rather than a costly micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s quiet solitude and methodical care give her a believable spine, but her interiority never cracks under pressure; the prophecy arrives as feeling, not friction, so her shift from observer to communal guide feels smooth rather than costly. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—she simply decides to share—so the “earned” turn leans on assertion, not visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is concrete—"fingers he no longer fully trusted"—and the contradictory pull between exile and fatherhood is embodied in the pillbox moment. The final decision to "vouchsafe…his own authentic truth" is prepared by the accumulation of snow-code beats, so the renunciation feels earned. Still, the core flaw—burned-spy competence versus self-doubt—is stated more than it is tested in action; we are told the storm "raged" but see only solitary ritual. Micro-choices exist (carving, pocketing the photo) yet lack an external obstacle that would force visible trade-offs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The coachman’s interior contradiction—his calm acceptance of harsh winds while ritually binding unseen vows—surfaces only in summary; no single on-page beat forces him to choose between safety and service, so the promised cost never materializes. His “spindrift serenity” is stated repeatedly but never tested by an external threat or moment of hesitation, keeping the character static rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s potter-trained attention becomes a credible sense-dial; every micro-choice (brushing buried glass, kneading soil with pottery tools) is traceable to his “center-the-clay” trait and advances his quiet goal. Interiority stays embodied—no diagnostic labels, only haptic cues: glass “warm despite the scorching sun,” ground “thrumming” back at his palms. Stakes deepen through externalized patience: the longer he attends, the more the oasis awakens, making his final resolve feel earned rather than declarative. The closing image of “hands shaping invisible clay” crystallizes his enduring stance and cost—he will carry this vigil and its responsibility to others. Hairline slip: “sharp gentleness” is asserted twice; trimming one would perfect the show-don’t-tell balance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “wistfully pragmatic heart” is shown via micro-choices (pocketing the gauge, angling moonlight). The contradiction between city gardener and canal-legacy locksmith charges every beat; her final stance (renunciation of shore life for nocturnal stewardship) is earned. Secondary pressure from Jim is light but sufficient to re-weight her inheritance. Flaw: one “wistfully pragmatic” label recycles; else flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s interiority is lush—brittle awakening felt as “newly born, yet ancient”—but the arc is recursive summary rather than pressured choice. No micro-choice under threat is dramatized; the final insight is announced, not earned by a visible forfeiture. Character change is asserted (“she finally understood”) without on-page cost or alternative foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ghost-writer of passion yet personally hollow—is dramatized only in summary; the “emptier” claim is repeated, never embodied in a single beat where she falters mid-letter or recoils from a client’s kiss. The nest-touch supplies a micro-choice, but it is solitary and unopposed, so no cost or hierarchy of values is tested. The final vow to “never write another letter” that isn’t universal feels imported rather than earned by prior causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession is palpable via sleepless nights and charts, yet the interior contradiction—cautiously hopeful addict to proof—never collides in a single visible micro-choice under pressure; her final “wan smile” is the first embodied cost we see, so the decisive turn feels reported rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobia vs. hunger for open sky—are dramatized in bodily discomfort and the final step into boundless space. The “spatial mutiny” is her decision, not a label, and the cost is the familiar underground air she forfeits. Prudence surfaces only in the early tunnel caution; once the compass ignites, she risks paralysis and exile without hedging. Interiority stays concrete, though the lineage of the compass is briefly told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s synesthetic, face-blind perception is evoked vividly (“hands remembered what her eyes couldn’t”), but interiority drifts into self-exposition (“Today I will lance through…”) rather than embodied contradiction under threat. The assistant is deduced, never pressured, so the key relationship remains off-stage; Elena’s final stance costs her nothing on the page. Competence dominates over struggle—no misstep or visible flaw complicates the reveal. Methodical trait is asserted, not dramatized through costly micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Eli’s obsession with the coded journals is vivid and embodied (trembling fingers, copper nail pressed to panel), but the interior contradiction between “family duty” and “scientific obsession” is asserted rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final activation is motivated, yet the cost (professional ridicule, ecological risk) is named, not felt on the page. Secondary pressure from Dr. Aris is thin; one line of skeptical dialogue isn’t enough to force a visible shift in Eli’s hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s grief-rooted need to redeem “never” gives his ascent clear motive; the glass flake functions as an embodied choice-trigger, not mere symbol. Yet interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“luminous disbelief” repeated) that blurs micro-decisions under the scaffold. Still, his final step onto the wrap-mapped pathway carries earned cost: he forsakes the safe pull-out and the brother-ghost it represents.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “polished calm” under fire is embodied early and charged at closure; the contradiction between inherited vigilance and entrepreneurial risk feels lived-in. His bankruptcy resignation carries visible cost, yet the interiority occasionally drifts into thematic self-exposition (the final pulled-back line is asserted more than dramatized).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her noticing lens is trained on “glass dome,” “clipboard,” “daylily-pressed telegram,” anchoring her as a lucid-dream astronomer. The flaw is passivity: she never makes a risky micro-choice; the decoding breakthrough happens *to* her through star-alignment and Thorne’s arrival. The emotional arc is a smooth rise from private torment to shared relief, but because she does not *pay* anything or refuse an alternative, the cost is only felt, not dramatized. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to keep her above the mid-line.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    The druid’s interiority is vivid (“warlike serenity etched across her weathered face”) and her ritualistic micro-choices (feeding the seed with her own blood) embody cost, but her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the mentor remains an off-page cipher, so relationship-as-crucible is inert. The “finds lost things” gift is named repeatedly yet never constrains or complicates the rescue—its absence would change nothing. Final renunciation (accepting a lie-spanning glamour) is credible, but the emotional price is summarized, not felt in a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The visionary’s interiority is rich—“root-bound” bodily metaphor, contradictory dread/exhilaration—but their motivations stay abstract; no concrete flaw or hierarchy of values is tested. Micro-choices are present (touching scars, stepping into the maze) yet lack differentiated cost; the final insight is prompt-level paraphrase rather than embodied realization. Still, the single psyche is vividly drawn and consistent within its lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s “reckless idealist” core is shown through her traded destiny and tactile micro-choices (placing the card, tracing roots); internal contradiction is absent but embodied emotion and visible cost are present. The flash of barter is summary, not dramatized, so the decisive change feels lightly rather than fiercely motivated; still, her stance crystallizes with felt weight. No secondary character pressure on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—mourning his wife, ruined career, and stadium past while fondling a scrap of cloth—collides in the trailer, so his micro-choices (magnifier, sealing bag) earn a quiet renunciation with cost. The “confidently uncertain” credo activates in scene, not summary. Secondary pressure is thin (foreman’s shrug is light), but the single-POV default holds. Closure renunciation is credible, though emotional amplitude could push further.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her palm-reading of the seed’s “second heartbeat” embodies both awe and dread—but the story never lets her contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the “haunted ambition” is declared, not dramatized, so her final “purpose” feels inherited rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The librarian’s identity flux is only stated, never dramatized through micro-choices; the single on-page “choice” is passive acceptance during submergence, so the metamorphosis feels observer-reported rather than paid for. Interiority drifts into scenic label-speak (“identity’s tide,” “wonder in routine”) instead of body-level emotion. No contradiction is acted out under visible pressure; the creel is carried, not decision-forced. The result is a luminous persona sketch, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inspector’s interiority is vivid—“heartbeat of a hesitation” crystallizes her pivot—but the epiphany leans on abstract therapeutic shorthand (“dissolve the walls between hearts”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro-choice to lift the pearl is dramatized and costly, yet the crown transformation feels externally bestowed rather than wrested from flaw. Earned-Stasis closure lands because she accepts perpetual invisible weight, but the absence of a second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relationship crucible off the table. Voice remains consistent and individualized; still, the moment of absorption of “pure emotion” skirts diagnostic-speak, blunting the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s mourning, methodical temperament, and guilt over her brother’s death form a credible internal engine; her decision to descend alone into the tunnel and play the accordion feels earned by the layered memories and graffiti clues. The “truth-seeking river chronicler” identity, however, is mostly told—only one quick archival note and no on-page data collection—so profession doesn’t shape moment-to-moment choices. Emotions are embodied (shiver, tears) yet stay lyrically phrased; contradictory impulses surface mostly in reflection, not visible action. Still, the final act of musical surrender shows a visible cost and clear hierarchy of values, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    The veiled dreamer's interiority is abstract and diagnostically vague ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. We never see them decide to enter the library; the mist simply parts. The one concrete gesture—raising the watch—reads as plot key rather than character beat. No visible cost or irreversible stance crystallizes, so the arc feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. plant-telepathic empathy—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of the silent shell is earned and costly. The “fragile seedling” motif threads through her body (bones ache like over-ripe fruit) and sharpens when she refuses Empire dominion. No status/secondary character on page, so bullets waived. One hairline slip: “perforated destiny” voiced once in abstraction, but immediately embodied by fracturing ice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—healer of the dead who failed her sister—is vivid, but the on-page choice is passive: she completes the ritual exactly as always, no new risk or error. The “redemption” is asserted, not dramatized; no fresh cost or visible mistake complicates this session. Emotion is embodied (emerald warming, scent of apples) yet remains within safe competence. Micro-choices are present but do not narrow future options—she succeeds again, unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority floats in lyrical paraphrase—“contentment eluded her still,” “kindly decisive nature”—rather than dramatized contradiction. Climb and grotto supply embodied pressure, yet emotional beats are narrated from outside, blurring micro-choices. Forgiveness is asserted, not tested in scene, so the final “she had become the source herself” feels bestowed, not earned at visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elian’s “conscience for hire” premise is intriguing, but his interiority drifts into abstraction (“cloak of doubt,” “protected vulnerability”) rather than scene-locked contradiction. The micro-choice of selecting the sea-glass-and-driftwood chime is concrete, yet the emotional cost of advising the fisherman is summarized, not embodied. No genuine flaw complicates the decision; the stance of detached nuance feels curiously safe.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elien’s contradictory drives—mentor’s tenderness vs. temporal thief’s guilt—surface in the tightening of his skin and the decision to withhold, giving him texture. Maya’s blind trust and sudden demand (“Show me”) crystallize her arc, yet her interiority is filtered through Elien’s gaze; we get obedience but not private rebellion, so the crucible feels half-shared. The cost is visible—Elien regains a decade on the final line, flesh paying for wisdom—but because Maya’s vanishing is described from outside, her own felt price is muted, capping the earned punch.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s centuries-long obsession is palpable in the trembling hand around the arrowhead and the barefoot tread across dust “bearing memories,” but the interior contradiction—why this immortal still trembles—goes unmined. Micro-choices (placing the seven stones, following the crows) are present yet feel predetermined rather than risky; the stance crystallizes without visible trade-off. The earned stasis is credible, but the cost is more cosmic than personal, blunting emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s interiority stays at a summary level—“yearned to find the sacred,” “finally understood”—without embodied contradiction under pressure. His one visible micro-choice (unstrapping the pack) is clean, but the story tells us the keystone rewires him rather than letting us watch new behavioral specifics emerge. The ending claims a “change in him” yet offers no on-page stance shift we can taste; presence is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is diffuse: the spire “subtly transforms,” but Elias pays no personal price we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hemingway's synesthetic gift is dramatized through concrete sensory cross-bleed and drives every beat; the “why me?” ache is embodied, not labeled. Interior contradiction is missing—he never fears or resists the gift—so the arc is discovery-only, not self-revision. Still, his final micro-choice to light the pier with polychrome flames costs him solitude and secrecy, earning a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.7)
    Loran’s “quiet enthusiasm” is stated so often it becomes a badge, not a lived-in trait; the only embodied contradiction is the trembling fingers at the end, which is too late to complicate his prior calm. Interiority relies on shorthand—“stellar doubt began to creep”—rather than moment-by-moment friction. The final certainty arrives without dramatized struggle, so the cost feels announced, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Reaper’s grief is embodied in tactile handling of cloak, atlas, mechanism; naming ritual shows micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—“voice like dry leaves”—avoiding label-speak. No contradictory impulses in scene; shift from collector to namer is declared not dramatized, so cost feels moderate. Earned stasis lands, but earlier love-loss is told summary, flattening peak motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    The mage’s “lukewarm” label is repeated but never dramatized as a specific limitation that complicates the bell-mending; interiority drifts into abstract self-talk (“magic was never my strong suit”) instead of embodying contradiction under pressure. No micro-choice shows him risking failure because of tepid power; the rebuild succeeds on first attempt, so the promised flaw never shapes tactics or exacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The warden’s quietly obsessive caretaking and the photograph-triggered pivot to activist feel credible; his aunt’s single photo gives him a heritable flaw that collides with duty, and the final phone-calls show concrete micro-choices. Interiority stays atmospheric rather than diagnostic, though a touch of summary (“he understood then what he must do”) nudges him off the highest rung.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s sentimental streak is asserted (“secretly sentimental…tokens from each failed experiment”) but never dramatized in-scene; the interior contradiction between logician and dreamer is announced, not embodied. She makes only one micro-choice—placing the crystal over the flame—yet the beat is narrated from outside, so we feel no cost or bodily risk. The final “perfect balance” is declared without visible forfeiture, so the arc reads as achieved rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    The watcher's interior contradiction—precision versus dread—manifests in fumbling the parachute buckle under moonlight, a concrete micro-choice that costs calm. Muscle-memory encryption and tether-grab show professional embodiment, yet the arc stays observational; no path is foreclosed, only vigilance prolonged, so renunciation feels incomplete. Emotional specificity is high; moral ambiguity muted.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the hollow aftertaste of ego-death, the deliberate re-ignition of pain—yet the contradictory impulses (stay numb / dare to feel) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in split-second beats. The micro-choice to channel vitality into the brain is present and costly, but the “bridge between opposites” self-diagnosis in the final paragraph slips into therapeutic shorthand, blunting the full sting of her earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara’s interiority is thickly lyrical but abstract; “the hush of possibility just born” recycles four times without fresh embodiment. Traits (puzzle-mind, creativity-keeper) are declared, never tested under contradictory pressure; she never doubts or misreads the seed. The closing commitment to an unseen escape-room redesign is foreshadowed but not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. Voice remains coherent and occupational detail is specific, yet the absence of live friction keeps her just above archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope, noise vs. silence—are embodied in the throttle hand that both wounds and woos; the micro-modulations of engine pitch externalize a believable hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (lowering the blower) is earned because every prior beat tied the cord handle to the memory of Melody’s lullabies, so the cost of stopping is legible as surrendering the last acoustic relic. Interiority stays concrete (“pull cord handle…anchor to this strange ritual”) and avoids label-speak. The only bar to 9+ is that the interior contradiction never quite loops back to alter his tactics once the giggle returns; he freezes rather than renegotiates stance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is lyrically textured (“dimensionally homesick,” “patchwork illusion of connection”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulses play out in scene. The sole micro-choice—stepping forward at the end—is forecast from the first paragraph, so the renunciation feels pre-decided rather than paid for in the moment. Cost is asserted (“centuries of waiting”) rather than dramatized; the guardian never risks anything new during the on-page now.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—stoic sensitivity, despairing hope—remains embodied in every micro-choice (bare feet on cracked cobblestones, tear-vial distilled from private grief). The crozier’s metamorphosis is the visible cost of renouncing his inherited role; the final smile is earned because the previous failed approximations have already bled onto the page. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays within default. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-labelling (“hopeless alchemist” early) but it is quickly dramatized through ritual failure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s want-to-find-beginnings motive is stated repeatedly, but only the final silent tuning beat dramatizes a costly micro-choice. Interiority drifts into thematic self-explanation (“she knew she must succeed by discarding assumptions”) that reads therapeutic rather than embodied. A single, earned renunciation (letting the towers sleep) lands, but earlier beats stay ornamental, not crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    Liam’s contradictory states—hopeful ferryman / fractured survivor—are stated via backstory blocks rather than dramatized micro-choices in the present scene; the “hourglass” and “vanishing ferry” act as external proxies for interiority, so his moment-to-moment emotional risk never quite lands under pressure. The final sense of wholeness is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—artistic control vs. longing for his sister—surface in the moment he touches the tapestry; the cost is the surrender of solitary authorship. Interiority stays concrete (“a jolt of recognition”) without label-speak. The final stance, shared authorship of a living dream, is earned by prior causality and forecloses the safety of detached creator. Slight safety-hedge: his flaws (obsessive isolation) are named more than enacted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael’s “balancedly curious” trait stays ornamental; no moment shows curiosity colliding with fear or cost. The interiority drifts into thematic summary (“Navigation isn't just about direction...”) rather than embodied contradiction. Because the breakthrough arrives off-stage via returned ships, the instructor’s agency is diluted—he does not pivot under live pressure. Closure still lands as earned stasis (his method accepted) so the arc holds, but the emotional price is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s “persistently curious” tag is shown twice but never costs her anything; interiority stays vivid and embodied. Micro-choices (tuning the aid, moving to the garden) are tied to motive, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her path. Closure choice—calling security—reads as competence, not flaw-driven cost, so the arc flattens. Grandmother’s unseen vigilance supplies emotional charge, but Elena’s own transformation is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and salt-stained vocation are vivid, embodied, and drive every beat. The contradiction between her agoraphobia-like dread and her calling to descend into stone arteries is kept alive in sinew, not summary. Micro-choices—squaring shoulders, steadying breath—reveal a hierarchy of values. The ending’s Earned Stasis (she will return, cost accepted) is fully rooted in these traits.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The digital-ghost POV is vivid—heartbeat-counting as lifeline to the living is a lovely, embodied tic—but the interiority never complicates. No contradictory impulse surfaces; the “I hope to defragment” plan proceeds exactly as foreseen, so the arc is flat. The porcelain shard is handled, yet it never risks or costs anything; the moment of insight arrives free. Closure is a restatement of the opening mood rather than a stance crystallized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Interiority is poetic but abstract; the “copper-veined” trait never alters a micro-choice or complicates action, so motive stays one-note. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final success feels preordained rather than paid for. The tears are the only embodied cost, arriving only at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Aris’s interiority is evocative (“frostbitten hope,” “cosmic joke”) but stays in lyrical summary; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The shift from academic bitterness to witness is declared, not embodied in a micro-choice that costs them something on the page. The arrowhead warms, but Aris never acts on that cue in a way that forecloses the old goal—capture/dissection—so the arc feels observed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elayn’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is declared early and never questioned internally; the locust shell and heart-rhythm trick are accepted without hesitation, so no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final choice—uproot one sapling—costs nothing on the page: the orchard sighs, statues nod, city blooms, she keeps dust in a locket. Interiority stays safely lyrical (“her music a temporary escape”) rather than embodied under threat. Still, her single-minded through-line carries the fairy-tale arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s quiet, embodied rebellion—micro-choices like mapping blind spots, neutral mailman patter under guard gaze—keeps interiority concrete; the trembling mother’s single line crystallizes stakes without sentimentality. No diagnostic self-talk, no competence without strain; the smuggle costs him a lighter satchel and a permanent ledger absence. His flaw—hope as contraband—drives every beat and the final earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The carpenter’s twenty-year vow of silence and the reflex to “interpret silence as possibility” give a sharp, specific interior contradiction; the moment they feel the urge to sing, fear and desire collide bodily. Micro-choices—studying the fragment, stepping through ivy, letting the first note escape—track a credible hierarchy of values. Because the fragment dissolves and the bell remains, the renunciation carries visible cost, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. The only gap is a touch of stock phrasing (“heart of an overgrown field,” “breathtaking contrast”) that slightly blurs the idiosyncratic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret’s quiet obsession is credibly eccentric—her “emotional-resonance” shelving and 3 a.m. rituals feel specific, not quirky for its own sake. The scarf as inherited memory conduit gives her a tactile, personal stake that escalates when it unravels into light; the cost is felt. Interiority stays concrete (“breathing in the scent of old paper and mathematical possibility”) rather than label-heavy. The final smile and journal entry show earned, not tidy, resolution—she has paid with the scarf’s dissolution and her lifelong solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief-propelled ritualism is credibly obsessive; her micro-choices (3 a.m. shift, basement alchemy) embody the wound. Interiority stays concrete, but the sister’s transformation is accepted without on-page resistance, blunting cost. Motive coherence is high; change arc is more told than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s calm, ritual precision and the interior contradiction—longing to liberate others while remaining solitary—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (counting steps, ribbon touch). The final renunciation of the ribbon is earned and legible, though interiority occasionally drifts toward self-explanatory “wisdom” phrases that soften the edge of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s folklorist vocation anchors every micro-choice—sketching constellations, palming mushrooms, comparing charts—so her curiosity never feels abstract. The恢复的 sequence (“her mother’s laughter…diploma…coffee”) dramatizes the memory-stitching with embodied specificity. However, the single-POV limits relational crucible, and her “chronically curious” label is stated twice without interior contradiction, muting flaw-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    The pruner’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet abstract; her “insatiably creative” trait is announced rather than dramatized in a concrete contradiction. She makes only one true micro-choice—surrendering to wonder while weaving—so the cost feels aesthetic, not personal. Earned stasis is present but muted: she “gives pieces of herself” yet we neither see nor feel what is lost. Voice remains consistent; however, the absence of tangible flaw or relationship pressure keeps her just shy of full-bodied credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s accumulated-silence attribute is dramatized in body (trembling hands) and micro-choice (needle work that literally inhales whispers). Her own fracture is kept active—she never “heals,” only trades one shard of damage for a sliver of usefulness, satisfying Earned Stasis. Jacob’s pressure is thin but sufficient to trigger her stance crystallization. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; only the tiniest drift toward therapeutic self-summary at “A secret isn’t meant…” keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s desire to “interpret silence with empathy” is palpable and specific; her interiority is filtered through tactile map-work and frame-by-frame video obsession, not abstract labels. The moment she aligns the torn edge with the constellation path shows a micro-choice that costs her the certainty of a physical discovery and re-routes her goal to experiential preservation—an earned renunciation. Her flaw—over-investing in erased places—drives the climax and is not cured, only accepted. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the top band is just missed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s “first-name basis with death” underwrites her calm analytic posture and supplies a believable motive for the quest; every beat of her inspection of the snow globe shows micro-choices that embody that detachment while letting grief leak through. Interiority stays concrete (“water droplets rolling down like tears” is felt, not labelled). The final realization—“death is a frequency shift”—is an earned conceptual renunciation that forecloses her old need for corporeal proof and carries visible emotional cost (the plane vanishes in the globe). What keeps this from 9-band is that the library itself never pressures her tactics; she could have had the epiphany in any quiet room, so the crucible is mental, not environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s empathy-for-silence motive is vivid, but her interiority stays in lyrical summary; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene. The childhood-backstory block is reflective rather than anchored to a present micro-choice that alters tactics. She “begins to compose songs again” is told, not dramatized, so the final renunciation lacks embodied cost. Still, her perceptual stance is specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s warmly inquisitive trait is shown through concrete, story-driving acts: retrieving the goggles, pocketing the diary, angling it to scattered light. Each micro-choice tightens her mission and forecloses the option of remaining a passive servant. Interiority stays sensorial, not therapeutic—goggles cold on skin, diary pages resistant—so affection and detachment coexist without label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the decrypted book) is earned by every beat since floor two; cost is visible when she carries the captain’s secret silently back into uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s contradictory mix of scientific rigor and mystical cloud- empathy is embodied in every beat: the cool brass anchors her, the swaying gondola narrows her senses, her handwriting stays precise while aloft. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead we get “clouds looked anxious, their edges frayed like worried thoughts,” showing her professional gaze fused with private grief. The final renunciation—choosing to keep observing while rescue is still uncertain—pays off the earlier causality that her mentor disappeared doing exactly this, so the cost of possible death is palpable. All micro-choices reveal a hierarchy: mentor’s memory > personal safety > scientific vindication, each visible in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The interior contradiction of a face-blind portraitist is crisp from the first line, and every beat (tracing grain, kneeling to pry the board, pressing coin into clay) is filtered through her perceptual bias. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values: sky-mapping vs. salvaging human essence. The final renunciation—accepting the building’s fall while pocketing the coin—carries visible cost and is earned by her prior pattern-seeking. Only the “algorithmic key” moment flirts with diagnostic label-speak, not quite embodied enough for the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eli’s curiosity is shown through tactile beats (tracing squares, pocketing journal) and a single interior contradiction—he craves solitude yet hungers for mentor approval—embodied in the final line. Cost is present but light: a racing heart and the abstract forfeiture of secrecy. The dog-eared phrasebook re-appears as micro-choice, anchoring trait to action. Still, no genuine flaw complicates his success; diligence alone drives the win.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elias’s desire to “learn the rhythm of repair” is declared early and repeatedly, but interiority stays at lyric distance; we watch reverent gestures rather than feel contradictory impulses. The only micro-choice that visibly costs him—kneeling to open the box—mirrors the ancestral pattern he already trusts, so the beat confirms rather than tests motivation. Competence is total; no mis-tumblers or doubt leak in to complicate his locksmith identity. The final “belonging” lands as affirmation, not renunciation or charged stasis, so the arc feels circular instead of irreversibly changed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elion’s benevolent stasis is clear, but Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait is asserted, not embodied; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice shows why she alone bridges worlds. Interiority is generic (“quiet conviction”) and the ghost’s non-corporeal limits never complicate his plan—no visible cost or flaw drives a mistake. The ending’s communal euphoria is sweet but unearned: we are told trust deepens, not shown a beat where it might have cracked. Closure lands as feel-good summary, not character-driven renunciation or change.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s tireless, bruised awe is the only interiority we get; it’s vivid but monolithic. No contradictory impulse ever complicates his trance, so the “beautifully flawed” label feels pasted on rather than lived. The micro-choice is the final press of cracked ceramic to spindle—one beat, cleanly motivated—but because he never risks anything we see, the cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.4)
    Interiority stays mostly abstract; Elias’s “heavy heart” and “rare smile” are declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—he simply obeys the blueprint. The closing peace feels declared, not earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—career triumph versus emotional husk—is vivid early; the “molecular bonds” conceit threads her perceptual lens cleanly through the piece. The embodied grief in her kneeling to trace foam and the micro-choice to phone her sister crystallize values under pressure. Flaw: the sister’s voice is too generically forgiving, flattening status dynamics and softening the cost Elara must actually pay.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vendor’s motivation—“to find the place where stories begin”—is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a pressured choice. Interiority is atmospheric (“they finally understood…”) rather than embodied or contradictory. The closing beat of “welcoming” the first customer is a gentle action but does not foreclose a path or exact visible cost. No micro-choice under tension shows why this matters more than the parole ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kael’s sensory curse and his self-devised coping ritual give him a sharp, need-driven interior life; every beat is filtered through taste-as-memory. The contradictory pull—seek more remorse to blunt remorse—drives every micro-choice without explicit self-diagnosis. His trembling hands at the end embody visible cost, earning the shift from hollow to “lighter.” The only missed opportunity: we never feel a live relationship under pressure; the fortress folk remain background furniture.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena’s motivation is legible and consistent, but interiority stays at summary level (“she knew,” “she understood”) rather than dramatized contradiction. No moment shows her simultaneously wanting harmony and fearing failure; choices are declared, not embodied. The final beat of attaching the new chain is symbolic rather than a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The engineer’s obsession with “excavating abandoned dreams” is stated repeatedly but never tested by an external obstacle or relationship; interior monologue substitutes for dramatized contradiction. The only embodied emotion is a single tear—“tears mixing with moonlight”—which feels performative because no prior bodily cue anchors it. Micro-choices are missing: we are told the brain is rewiring but never shown a moment where that rewiring forces a trade-off or error under pressure. The arc is a smooth ascension to transcendence rather than a flawed person paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Elara’s prism-mind is sketched more than dramatized; we’re told it lets her see hidden connections, but the only on-page payoff is the final “unique perception” key-turn. Interiority drifts into abstract labels—“latent blaze,” “genuine desire”—rather than embodied contradiction. The mission succeeds because she already possesses the exact interpretive gift required, so no flaw complicates the outcome; cost is asserted (“renewed responsibility”) rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s ember-motivation to “restore music to this silent world” is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—kneeling, tracing, strumming—rather than label-speak. The contradiction between her yearning for sound and the silence she must work inside is felt on the page, not declared. Tears at the end are the visible cost of empathy, earning her renunciation of further carving in this moment. Cap at 8.7 because no second character means relationship crucible is N/A and the interior arc, while strong, does not force a higher-stakes external choice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is textured through the basalt stone, notebooks, and precise ritual; the dent embodies decades of habit. His contradictory impulses—yearning for redemption yet rejecting mere restoration—stay active in scene. The final gesture of offering the stone skyward crystallizes an earned renunciation rather than a tidy absolution. Minor slack: the “arrogance” motive is told more than shown in a dramatized flash.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s pacifist-vibrational worldview is vivid and particular; her micro-choices (striking forks, adjusting crystals) manifest a believable internal hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids label-speak, instead giving embodied, sense-rooted metaphors (“resonant hollow where memories echo”). The shift from cataloging silence to teaching empathy is earned by the diary’s reveal and carries visible cost—she weeps, foreclosing her solitary path. Flaw: no contradictory impulse actively fought in-scene; tension is contemplative rather than crucible, keeping her just shy of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tracing the wrapping paper, the seed’s scent pulsing in her sinuses—and her goal intensifies cleanly from curiosity to guardianship. The final renunciation (she accepts village anchor, abandons wandering ambition) is legible, but the cost is stated rather than dramatized; we are told “she finally felt the peace” instead of seeing a micro-choice that forfeits an alternate life. Interior contradiction is present but soft: her fear of the elders’ judgment is named once and never retested. Still, the sensory-embodied motive and earned station lift the score into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arion’s interiority is thin: we get “dread and wonder” but no contradiction or bodily detail. The arrow-tip growth power arrives as convenient exposition, not a tested limit. Still, his lineage link to the seed-fragment gives a credible, felt cost at the end—he alone can carry the knowledge home—so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena’s professional compulsion to “cultivate foresight in action” is repeatedly named but never dramatized as a contradictory impulse that costs her anything; the patch is worn but never allowed to sway a micro-choice. Her twenty-year résumé is asserted, not tested. The interiority stays picturesque (“her rapidly adapting mind processed”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under threat. No error, but no earned contradiction or stasis either.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Eira’s synesthetic lens gives her interiority texture—color-sound cross-wiring shapes every micro-choice, never abstracted. The weight-of-legacy motive is visceral: “amber music sheet pulsing… energy of ancient wisdom” makes inherited obligation felt in her palms. The final renunciation—lowered hands, luminous sheet—pays the cost of bearing witness, foreclosing any return to ordinary silence. Flaws: no contradictory impulse in scene, and the interior arithmetic (“certify wonder as essential”) edges toward thesis-speak mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eldrin’s interiority is concrete and character-particular; trembling hands, the weight of boots on stones, the decision to kneel and place each stick—each micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (pride vs. shame, duty vs. release) are held simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation that forecloses the path of control and opens healing. The only tiny slip: “avalanchingly quiet” risks poetic overkill twice, but it is filtered through his self-accusatory ear so the voice remains coherent. Closure cost is legible—flute lighter yet more precious, driftwood returned, silence now internal—so the 9+ bar is met.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s cold-data persona is vivid, but Thomas remains a cipher; the empathy-borrow never costs her anything on the page, so the “earned” clause fails. Interiority is sharp (“counted the event as precisely as she counted heartbeats”) yet the climactic choice—send him away—repeats the beat she always performs, so no new value hierarchy is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Ayla’s shift from “jittery courier” to deliverer-of-wonder is legible and touching, but the interior contradiction is told (“confidence replacing the jitters”) rather than dramatized in a final beat; the mentor’s absence is a felt ache yet never complicates her on-page choice, so the change leans more declarative than embodied. Micro-choices—touching the pendant, pausing to watch auroras—are present but low-pressure; no beat forces her to risk the pendant or her new identity, so the arc is emotionally resonant but causally soft.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract self-labeling (“truthful lies,” “knew in her bones”) that blurs embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure visibly costs her anything until the final beat, so the arc feels observed rather than earned. The prism’s warmth is the only embodied cue that her stance has shifted; more bodily risk or forfeiture was needed mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrically consistent—“wistful” is shown through her dutiful daily touching of the bead and her quiet offerings—yet the sacrifices read as symbolic rather than personally costly; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page. The grandmother’s injunction is the sole engine; Elara’s own desire or resistance never complicates the quest. The final “weaving sound” is pretty but causally unmoored from the bead’s prior mechanics, so the change feels bestowed, not earned through visible flaw or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the “quiet determination” is shown through bodily action (hands, eyes) rather than labels. The awakening bargain is dramatized—his wrapped hammer and the cold-burn surge—so the change feels earned. Minor slip: the final paragraph drifts toward thesis-statement (“true resilience wasn’t about avoiding brokenness…”) which softens the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The map-maker’s interiority is lyrically rendered, but the only on-page choice—reaching for the red shard and being repelled—remains reactive; no contradictory impulse or micro-choice alters tactics. Memory gaps and “determination” are stated, not dramatized, so the arc stalls at yearning. The withheld truth motive is clear early, yet the ending’s refusal costs nothing we can feel, keeping the change ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    The interior contradiction between Elias’s reticence and his new hunger for connection is stated more than embodied; we never feel the cost in body or choice. His single micro-choice—adding one stone—reads as symbolic compliance rather than a stakes-driven decision that could have failed. The warmth in his eyes is asserted, not shown through biased noticing that would reveal character. Because the arc is interior and the external action is minimal, the absence of a visible, risky beat keeps the change informational.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her laughter as meteorological barometer is a fresh, embodied quirk—but the “ancient manuscripts” remain abstract; we never see a page or a line that teaches her prophetic knack, so her competence feels handed-down rather than earned. The moment she steers the refugee fleet is decisive, yet the cost (fear of a wrong prophecy) is stated, not dramatized; she never hesitates or mis-steers, so the flaw stays theoretical. Still, her voice is distinct, and the final “shadowed elation” crystallizes a believable tension between duty and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaelen’s interior lens is vivid—his borrowed heart literally colors perception—but the arc drifts from active pursuit to passive realization; the crucial discovery feels beheld rather than fought for, lowering the cost legibility. The “quietly explosive” trait is invoked more than dramatized; no beat shows him risking failure or reputation while testing dyes on neighbors. Micro-choices track light angles and mix formulas, yet contradiction or sacrifice never crystallize; the ending smile registers as epiphany without visible price, capping earned change at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    Samuel’s interiority is evocative—moonlight healing, cataloging sorrow—but his contradictory impulse (pursue arboreal truth vs. maintain stone labyrinth) stays summary; no in-scene moment forces a painful trade-off. The epiphany is gifted by resonance, not an active choice that costs him a path, so the arc feels observed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The keeper’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholeness while fragmenting themselves into thread—is dramatized in the swaddling beats, giving us embodied cost (“hands trembled”). Motive intensifies cleanly: restore realm → weave dawn → sacrifice self. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices (humming, final weave) do reveal a hierarchy of values. Flaw is poetic passivity: keeper only acts once orchard ecology permits; still, the renunciation lands with felt fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is rich—solitude vs. compassion enacted in the micro-choice of smoothing the invitation note rather than attending—yet the “staying while leaving” method is declared more than embodied, so the final cost feels lightly rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eliza’s interior contradiction—guilt for past silence vs. present need to protect—drives every beat; the bread-as-forgiveness object reweights her stance with visible cost when she leaves the last pieces behind. Micro-choices (pouring tea, reading aloud) keep pressure alive. Her flaw (hesitation) compounds earlier, then is accepted in the final renunciation, earning stasis. No secondary character on-page, so status and relationship tests are waived; single-POV interiority stays concrete and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elias’s gently meticulous nature is shown through tactile ritual—gloved rotation of the slide, millimetric ledger entries—so the trait governs action, not label. Interiority stays concrete: his hope “surged” only after the sampler’s chime offers proof, tying emotion to instrument. The final smile is earned because his prior micro-choices (precise sampling, slide-handling) directly enable the discovery that vows can be saved; renunciation of easier despair is visible. Still, no second character or status friction means pressure is purely situational; the arc is steady stewardship rather than contradiction, capping depth at mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eliza’s “curiously steadfast” trait is dramatized through the odd, non-economic goal of recording betrayal-sound; her micro-choices (false rumors, escalating lies) flow from that motive. Interiority is concrete—she gauges panic in others’ shuffles and knife-hands—but the emotional contradiction promised by “curious” vs. “steadfast” is only asserted, never felt as inner split or cost. The heirloom’s recording power is accepted without skepticism, so the flaw is less struggle than uncanny competence. Still, her decisions alone drive every beat, meeting the 9+ threshold for agency if not for visible self-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The luminous skeptic’s interior contradiction—charting weather with empirical tools while tasting cosmic ballot-boxes—is dramatized in embodied beats (metallic/salty palate, vibrating ring). Their acceptance of storm-carriership is foreshadowed by grand-father lore and charged micro-choice to clasp the storm-man’s hand; the cost (“forever merging”) is felt. Still, the shift from detached observer to willing vessel pivots on a single handshake; deeper resistance/complicity knots could sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mnemonically-gifted trait is shown in action as he navigates the cave from perfect recall; charcoal stains embody vocation and guilt. Interior contradiction surfaces when remembered praise ('You paint what others want') collides with the need to paint only for himself; the embodied cost is charcoal ground into skin. Final choice to repaint Cora's portrait under crystal light is earned by the earlier paralysis triggered by critics’ words. Micro-choice: tracing the indentation with blackened fingertips before lifting the canvas signals the switch from fear to reclamation—visible, tactile cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s trait of wilting near lies is vivid and organically shapes her exile, but the story never lets that attribute exact an on-page cost during the decisive moment; she simply decides to leave at dawn. The interiority is lyrical yet occasionally drifts into diagnostic self-explanation (“her greatest motivation consumed her”). Because the final beat is a calm resolution rather than a crucible that tests her body against deception, the promised contradiction never crystallizes in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is poetic but abstract—her “gift of heightened perception” is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The seasonal muteness is a striking constraint, yet we never see it force a moment of visible cost or tactical change; it’s ornamental. The final image of the sculpture pulsing new colors is beautiful, but the emotional cost is implied rather than felt on the page. The arc is one of steady devotion rather than transformation, so the Earned Stasis is credible, but the absence of a wrenching contradiction keeps her just short of memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Unit 734’s contradictory impulse—mechanical duty vs. impossible nostalgia—is dramatized in the pause to polish and the hidden chest-opening; the final sacrifice is foreshadowed, so the renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“strangely organic fingers danced”) rather than diagnostic. Still, the thousandfold split is declared more than embodied, so the cost is glimpsed rather than felt in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Leo’s interiority stays gentle-observer, never crystallizing into a risky choice; the one beat where he decides to “prove listening heals” is told, not dramatized. His contradiction—wanting to return the locket yet hoarding authority over it—never complicates action, so the ending gift of the letters feels benevolent rather than earned. No embodied cost or visible flaw drives the final gesture; he remains the same curated man we met.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s “calm defiance” is repeatedly asserted rather than dramatized; her only micro-choice is to finish the dance sequence, which succeeds at once without visible cost or contradiction. Interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she had learned that…”) instead of embodied tension. Still, the dancing-as-decryption premise is individual and the ending renunciation (dice dropped) carries faint cost, meeting the low bar for earned change at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—“trembling hands,” “salt crystals seemed to hum”—but the brother’s erased memory is told, not dramatized; her final stance change is soft, more comfort than cost. The micro-choices (swirling coffee, pressing wildflower) are specific, yet the stakes plateau once the crystal is found. Earned, but not pushed to the limit.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation—hushing a coded prophecy that haunts his dreams—is stated early and sustained, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“quiet intensity,” “terrestrially cosmic forces”) rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are present yet feel choreographed by the ritual rather than revealing personal flaw or genuine struggle; the cost is aesthetic (loss of the paper crane) rather than psychic. No contradictory impulse complicates the single-minded quest, so the arc is smooth but thin. Still, the voice remains consistent and the renunciation lands with a visible, if gentle, price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clara’s curiosity about “architectural dialect” is vivid, but her interiority slips into exposition (“it’s inheritance…”) rather than embodied contradiction. Mr. Abernathy’s politely nimble grace is shown once, then told repeatedly; we never see that trait complicate a choice. The familial reveal lands as abstract information, not a decision she must weigh under pressure—no visible cost is paid by either character.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is lyrical and consistent, but emotions are named ("sorrow of forgotten civilizations") rather than embodied; the decisive shift to archivist is declared, not dramatized with a micro-choice, so the cost feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s guilt-driven resolve is vivid; the blood-signed confession feels earned because the thorn and key have been tactilely present. Yet his “decades” of isolation are told, not embodied—no tremor, hunger scar, or sensory ghost intrudes on the marble. The sister’s jeopardy is pure backstory, never threading the present beat, so the sacrifice cost reads abstract. Interiority is strong but over-tidy: “he understood that some keys open not doors, but hearts” compresses a life-shift into proverb.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The echo singer’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. custodial duty—fuels every beat; the shift from observing the child’s echo to actively soothing it is embodied in the seashell’s glow and her foreign smile. Flaw: the “reed-blown melancholy” is labeled repeatedly rather than shown through bodily wear or voice strain, muting the cost of centuries.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s “salvage something pure” motive is declared repeatedly but never put at risk; she never hesitates, sacrifices, or jeopardizes her safety. The interiority stays at poetic label level—“she felt the lingering presence”—rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices are missing: she simply “descended,” “found,” “documented,” “began visiting,” each step narrated rather than dramatized. The captain’s gratitude is the only cost acknowledged, but it is projected onto him, not paid by her.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    The net-mender’s interiority is poetic but diffuse—no contradiction is forced under pressure, so his “choice” to descend and whisk-tea feels foregone. Embodied emotion is present (gnarled hands, reverent whisk-froth) yet never pits two desires against each other; the cost is atmospheric, not personal. The arc is a loop of contemplation rather than a crucible of change, so motivation stays ornamental. Still, the occupational texture and nightly ritual give him a memorable, idiosyncratic silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maya’s “sharply observant” trait is asserted but never embodied in a way that complicates her choices; the shredded-letter reassembly happens off-page, so we see no raw-finger cost or micro-choices that reveal interior conflict. The renunciation at the end—guardianship instead of exposure—arrives as an abstract stance rather than a crucible moment with visible price. Competence is foregrounded, but genuine struggle and contradictory impulse under pressure are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s isolation and pattern-recognition obsession are vividly interiorized; the contradictory pull between scientific detachment and prophetic responsibility gives him credible friction. Yet his lone vigil means no on-page relationship crucible, and the only micro-choice we witness is the final smile—earned, but too late to test his values under visible cost. The interiority is strong, but the absence of embodied stakes-touching action caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The poet’s gentle, self-sacrificing nature is consistent, but he never faces a real dilemma or pays a visible price; the “wistful” mask never slips into contradiction, so the arc is flat. Interiority is atmospheric rather than conflicted, and the final act costs him nothing we can feel. No micro-choice under pressure sharpens his values hierarchy. Earned Stasis is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” nature is shown, not told, through his split-second calibration of tuning-fork math against ancestral dread; the key’s warming in his pocket is a tactile micro-choice that externalizes the contradiction. The closing forehead-touch ritual earns a credible endurance stance with visible cost—the guardian burden is re-upped, not merely declared. Interiority stays concrete (“panic warred with strict logic”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only limit: no secondary character on-page, so relationship/status crucible is absent by scope, capping the band at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mapper’s patient-revolution motive is coherent and embodied in meticulous moon-tracking, but interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized (“sculpting patience from impatience” repeated). No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices are present yet feel pre-planned, reducing felt cost at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s professional calm is well-embodied, but her “quiet rebellion” is asserted more than dramatized; no on-page moment shows her bending protocol under pressure. Interiority is concrete—her chest tightening at the lantern—but the decisive pivot to personal liberation is only summarized. The lantern’s historical pull is felt, yet the causal leap from ancestral memory to career-risking action is compressed into a final-sentence vow. Competence is clear, genuine struggle is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Father Michael’s shame-guilt calculus is palpable in the velvet-case hesitation and the pocket-switch to the letter; the contradictory pull to preserve yet abandon the heart is embodied, not declared. The moment he lifts the letter instead of the repair ticket, the micro-choice re-prices his pension and priestly identity—visible cost on the page. Secondary pressure from Ms. Eleanor is light but sufficient: her recoil and quiet verdict crystallize his renunciation. The endurance of brokenness is earned; the silence that follows carries the weight of forty unthanked years.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glider’s “steadily curious” trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested against a conflicting impulse; its interiority is limited to abstract yearning. No micro-choice shows curiosity costing it anything or foreclosing another path. The arrow-tip pickup is the single character-driven beat, yet it triggers no internal tension. Because the closure is purely symbolic (the unheard bell), the glider’s evolution feels pre-programmed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s curiosity and risk-taking are vivid, but interior contradiction is stated rather than dramatized (“she needed to find…” vs. no visible competing impulse). No embodied emotion under pressure—static screen-tracing replaces body reaction. The lie is confessed, not lived; we never feel her pulse spike or palms sweat. Career-suicide stakes are declared, not tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s shadow-wielding intuition is embodied in the orchard ritual, but interiority edges toward generic “peacekeeper” labels; the shard biting her palm is a sharp, specific moment that grounds her courage. The final reconstitution is earned by prior mirror glimpses, yet the elders’ skepticism is off-stage, so the cost feels abstract rather than interpersonal. Flaws (anomaly, risk of failure) are stated, not lived—no visible mistake compounds before success. Still, her calm signature holds across beats, and the refusal to capitulate to fear gives a credible, if quiet, Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elena’s “grip reality loosely” trait is vividly dramatized in her tactile obsession with the parasol tip and her willingness to linger between ice and water. Interiority is concrete (fingers tracing lace, cheeks freezing with tears) and avoids stock therapy-speak. The change from seeking death to choosing to stay is legible, but the causal chain that converts the parasol from memento to bridge feels asserted rather than tested under pressure; hence the shift lands as gentle epiphany, not earned rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sentinel’s gentle, reflective interiority is consistent and embodied (thumb on charred paper, chill against skin), but he never makes a visible micro-choice that costs him anything; the “rediscovery” is purely cognitive, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-tested. No contradiction under pressure, yet no hinge moment where his persuasion either fails or exacts a price. Earned Stasis is hinted but not dramatized—he simply keeps sitting. Consequently, characterization stays competent but stops short of compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is lyrical and sustained, but the walker’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the cost of isolation is asserted, not embodied in a micro-choice. The final “renewed purpose” is a summary uplift rather than a visible renunciation with price. Still, the voice-specific perception and ritual micro-gestures keep the portrait above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s calm perceptivity surfaces in micro-gestures—tracing arcs with “barely there” touch—yet the story never lets that trait cost her anything; she remains serenely effective, so the promised flaw stays ornamental. Interiority is dove-soft and consistent but lacks contradiction under pressure; she never hesitates, doubts, or re-prioritizes. The ending’s “lighter in spirit” line claims internal change, yet nothing on-page shows her relinquishing or endangering her method, so the arc feels asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scholar’s reticence is shown through whispered phonemes and trembling hands, but we never see a moment where silence costs him something concrete. Interiority drifts toward thematic summary (“sacred duty”) rather than embodied contradiction. Still, the final crystalline listening beat earns a micro-choice that tilts his stance from preservation to translation, giving the arc a modest earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prophet’s precognitively forgetful gift is more label than lived contradiction; only late does “he clung to the echoes” show a micro-choice. The caretaker’s single-scene entry supplies external pressure, but her exit is fiat, not crucible. The final smile-plus-turn feels tidy; the cost of losing the sound again is asserted, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for the stars while servicing the instruments that both reveal and bar her access—is palpable in the tactile beat of rescuing the clock. Her mentor’s “whispers” rule seeds her later epiphany; the micro-choice to set the golden clock outside is embodied, not abstract. Yet the “sage” descriptor is never dramatized beyond generic competence, and her final insight is delivered in an explanatory paragraph that tells us the cost rather than staging a visible forfeiture. Interiority is textured, but the earned stasis lacks an on-page price we can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The therapist’s calm is credibly maintained through embodied micro-choices (guitar placement, scent cataloguing) rather than labels. The vinyl fragment acts as an externalized flaw that pressures a final, visible act of renunciation when the son pockets the relic. Interiority stays concrete—humming appliances, cedar—never drifting into therapy-speak. The “decisively kind” trait is paid for by the sustained emotional labor of continuing the song after death, foreclosing the easier option of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s quiet deliberation is shown through tactile ritual, not label, and the grandmother-key anchors motive. Yet her interiority never cracks—no contradictory impulse, no visible cost—so the “change” at the end feels like discovery rather than earned renunciation. The budding-scholar trait is lived-in but stays competence-flavored; a single micro-mistake or forfeiture would have pushed this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eleanor’s skeptical-yet-forgiving psyche is shown through concrete ritual (bone-setting) and the iridescent tooth she still fondles; her simultaneous wonder and methodological care makes the final surrender to the impossible believable. Arthur’s “in-between” state is sketched with memorable economy. Secondary pressure is absent (no on-page relationship crucible), and the interior shift, though earned, costs her nothing outward; the emotional price is implied rather than staged, capping intensity just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s interiority stays concrete—her fingers test glass “with practiced fingers,” memory surfaces as tactile ritual—but the decisive shift from yearning to communal craft is skimmed; cost is asserted (“no longer felt weighed down”) rather than embodied in a moment of renunciation. Micro-choices are present (climb, collect, weigh, polish) yet none are staged as a crucible that forecloses the old dream; the pivot happens in summary. Still, her earthbound flaw complicates every beat, and the voice remains idiosyncratic enough to feel individual.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s quietly-proactive healing is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing the pendant, documenting the spiral, placing it on the keyboard—each carrying felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and bias-driven; the amber glow as “conversation between her grandmother's ghost and her own future” is character-particular. The final renunciation is earned: the pendant’s release forecloses the old guilt-laden identity and is anchored in the prior pattern of nature reclaiming tech. Flaws (over-observant self-labeling, slight diagnostic tinge in “stages of grief”) are minor and do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is lyrical and sustained, but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are reported rather than enacted; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized, so the “earned peace” feels declared, not paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “restore sacred practices” is declared early and remains steady, but interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice—activating the device—does not force a trade-off or visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (“heart ached”) yet drifts toward label-speak under peak pressure. The ending’s “smile” grants comfort without renunciation or tangible loss, so the arc lands as affirmation rather than earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist’s interiority is atmospheric but generic—no contradictory impulses or micro-choices break the surface; the heartbeat-map motive is declared, not dramatized under pressure. No cost or flaw complicates the final sealing; the ritual succeeds exactly as hoped. The character functions as a serene plot engine rather than a person gambling anything. Voice remains consistent but safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reflective locksmith nature is shown through tactile, embodied micro-choices (tracing gears, mapping light) that reveal a hierarchy of values—patience over spectacle. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. The final quiet renunciation—accepting the cavern’s teaching and the timer’s thrumming burden—pays visible cost in the image of her “second heartbeat synchronized with the earth,” foreclosing a return to ordinary life. The one flaw: the father’s lock maxim is recalled twice without fresh contradiction or pressure, a minor loop that keeps this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.7)
    A single, passive POV whose only “choice” is to endure calcifying their own burden; all other burdens arrive pre-packaged. Interiority drifts into self-mythologizing (“fractal within fractal”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship crucible, no secondary pressure, no micro-choice that alters later tactics. The ending’s “gift” is asserted, not dramatized through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clara’s grief-carving ritual is tactile and specific, but her interiority drifts into abstract summary (“harvest lessons from loss”) that keeps us at arm’s length; the lack of contradiction inside the single beat keeps her from feeling truly volatile under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cyrus’s regret-fuelled obsession is vivid and embodied in the scavenging, but his contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in scene. The camera-wheel choice is the only micro-action that truly reveals hierarchy-of-values; the ghost negotiation is prepared but still feels like summoned plot magic. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak (“profoundly chronologically confused”). The final merger is earned, pays visible cost, and reconciles flaw, so the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    Maya’s motives are sketched—curiosity plus “equations for hope” ambition—but her interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we’re told she is stoic yet “eyes alight,” never shown wrestling with fear of failure or ethical qualms about tampering with derelict infrastructure. The sextant piece acts as a lucky talisman more than a value-revealing choice; her engineering decisions are friction-free, lacking misbelief or flaw that could compound cost. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; the resurrection succeeds on first try, so no hierarchy of values is tested. Earned stasis arrives but the price feels external (rust, darkness) rather than personal, keeping motivation functional yet not fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s introversion and clock-scribe identity are shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing spirals, pocket-watch offering—rather than labels. The bear encounter crystallizes his internal contradiction between fear of failure and hunger for creation; the animal’s silent approval externalizes the self-forgiveness he cannot voice. The excruciatingly gentle gesture of surrendering the sealed watch dramatizes a visible cost: he relinquishes the symbolic coffin of his dream. Closure earns its stasis: he leaves lighter, dream re-owned, flaw intact but now productive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s contradictory mix of wonder and skepticism is well embodied, but her internal contradictions never collide in a single, pressure-cooked moment; the journal’s discovery is treated as inevitable rather than a costly choice that forces her to re-rank values. Motivation is clear and inheritable, yet the final “quiet understanding” is stated more than dramatized with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is sparse but concrete; the collector’s patience is shown through stillness and watching, not told. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the “philosophical” trait stays ornamental rather than tested. The final acceptance of the rope is credible because the prior stillness earns it, but the cost is more atmospheric than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush and sensorily anchored; the traveler’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the weft thread while writing deaths for the living—are dramatized in real time. Micro-choice (uncapping the pen for Thomas) crystallizes values. Cost is felt: “anchor and burden” line foreshadows the shift to compass. The self-obituary turn is earned, but the gardener remains off-page, so relationship crucible and status pressure are inactive; cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elorian’s longing to reawaken beauty is concrete and embodied (finger-tracing the walls, cradling the egg), and the final renunciation—dismantling society rather than the device—carries cost. Interiority defaults to lyrical summary (“bitter sweetness filled”) rather than contradictory in-scene impulses, capping depth. No second character on page, so status crucible N/A. Motive-to-action chain is clear, but micro-choices under pressure are narrated, not dramatized, softening the stake shift.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the foreign coin…tapped against her chest”), motives are anchored to the paradox of arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter, and micro-choices (wrapping grafts, sprinkling black sand) enact the “scars can sing” belief. However, the father remains off-stage, so the crucial status/relationship crucible is only implicit; the emotional cost is felt but not complicated by live opposition, capping advancement to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—“luminous skeptic” refracted through sensory detail—but her emotional hierarchy flattens in the climactic unstick beat; the renunciation of silence carries no visible cost on her body or choice, so the change feels graceful rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The otherworldly sentimentalist has a coherent, if abstract, interior motive—deliver illumination without combustion—and the text keeps returning to that desire. Yet it never makes a micro-choice whose cost we can feel; the transit simply happens, the gear keeps spinning, and the enlightenment spreads without visible renunciation or risk. Interiority is stardust-poetic but generic (“eternal yet changing, complete yet yearning”) rather than embodied. The result is a stylized sensibility rather than a character whose contradictions act under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.3)
    Elias’s interiority is textured—thumb on carved letters, ribbon against stone—but his contradictory impulses are summarized rather than dramatized in the final beat; the “fiercely meditative” trait is asserted repeatedly yet never complicates a live carving decision under pressure. The spectral mentor remains a voice-over, never an on-page pressure that forces a visible trade-off. Micro-choices are lyrical but not hierarchically costly; the poem ritual is recited, not weaponized. Earned stasis is gestured at, but the cost is abstract (“ribbon now nearly depleted”) rather than embodied in a final gesture that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Alaric’s precision and guilt are embodied early; the rake-handle epiphany, however, is delivered as abstract inscription-reading rather than a pressured micro-choice, so the interior shift feels announced, not dramatized. The final shout to the crowd is a visible action that finally externalizes motive, but the decisive turn hinges on carved slogans rather than on-page contradiction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s gentle obsession with cemetery echoes is vivid and embodied (“tender fingers,” “small, soft smile”), but the sacrificial reveal lands as an external twist rather than a contradiction that costs him anything. Interiority is rich yet static; no micro-choice is forced by the discovery, so the shift stays observational.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s motives are legible—she maps the unknown to save her village—but interiority stays at a distance; we witness her stance (“quiet determination”) more than contradictory impulses. The kingfisher quill and spire are evocative extensions of self, yet they don’t force a visible trade-off; the cost is asserted (“buy them time”) rather than dramatized. Still, the refusal to indulge prophecy without data anchors her as a scientist-mystic hybrid, a fresh archetype. The absence of a second on-page character limits status or relational pressure, so the crucible is purely internal and therefore flatter.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The copyist’s motivation—restoring silenced narratives via dust—is vivid and ideologically charged, yet her interiority stays largely declarative (“she believed stories should flow freely”) rather than dramatized through micro-choices under immediate threat. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; she glides from transcription to pirate broadcast without visible hesitation or cost, so the climax feels predetermined rather than earned. The final smile and walk home lack embodied toll, keeping the arc in thematic silhouette rather than lived crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s interiority is evocative—her fingers tracing the mask, the rocking chair’s creak marking time—but her motives remain abstract (“crystallize fleeting emotions”) rather than dramatized through a specific on-page choice. The contradiction between her pursuit of “safety” and her embrace of fragility is declared, not embodied in a visible micro-decision that costs her something tangible. The final “continuous process of becoming” lands as thematic assertion; we are not shown one irrevocable renunciation or charged poise that proves she has paid for this wisdom. Without a causally earned beat of forfeiture, the arc leans lyrical summary over character-driven change.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Milo’s “rationally rebellious” stance is cleanly dramatized through the deliberate cataloguing gesture and the muttered “They condemn what they don’t understand.” Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional range is narrow; we never feel the promised “agonizing” as embodied contradiction—only as label. The final choice to preserve is credible yet cost is implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor’s “expectantly resigned” shell is vivid, but the text tells the trait more than it dramatizes contradictory impulses in scene; the choir remains an off-stage chorus rather than individuals who pressure her to choose or risk anything. Interiority is atmospheric yet generic (“expectantly resigned manner had developed”), lacking a single moment where resignation visibly costs her a live option. Micro-choice under pressure is missing; handing over the rosette is symbolic but not a fork that hurts. The emotional arc is therefore more illustrated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elias’s memory-tasting gift is vividly embodied early (“every ingredient he touched”), but interiority slides into lyrical assertion (“he could already taste the memories…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The pruning micro-choice nicely externalizes self-surgery, yet no secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are moot. Final renunciation lands as quiet affirmation, but the causal trail is thin: the seed’s consciousness murmurs, not compels. Earned stasis feels gentle rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s forced-truth trait gives her a sharp, story-driving flaw; her micro-choice to lead the agents up the tower visibly costs her professional safety. The final bridge-moment with the weeping supervisor works because her candor is the only conduit to forgiveness. Yet her interiority stays generic (“her heart sank”) and the old man’s despair is delivered second-hand, blunting the emotional polarity needed for 8+.

    Aria’s gift for noticing creeping normality is clear, but her interior contradiction—curiosity vs. fear of trespass—stays off-page; the moment at the cottage only restates her calm certainty. The final “smile” is performed emotion that feels unearned after zero embodied struggle. Micro-choices (placing objects) never risk failure or social cost, so the sanctifying quest reads as pre-decided routine, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Diver’s interior contradiction—clinging to academic certainty while the statue dismantles it—surfaces early and recurs, but the final “nod” is gestural shorthand; we never feel the embodied cost of surrendering a lifelong intellectual scaffold. Statue’s “incisively kind” trait is asserted, not dramatized in any choice that risks its own safety or purpose, so the promised kindness stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Interiority is vivid but drifts into self-diagnosis (“grim optimism hardened into resolve”) rather than embodied contradiction. The dice-as-talisman anchors micro-choices, yet Elias’s affective range narrows to perseverant climb without errant impulse testing his balanced daring. Closure choice is voiced rather than dramatized; we are told he now makes the bet, not shown the tremor of hand or recalibrated odds. Chipped corner as flaw-comrade is strong, but its psychological cost stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter’s insomnia, methodical hope, and need to resurrect kindness through lost languages are credibly layered; her trembling fingers and whisper to jasmine embody the motive. Yet the piece never risks her flaw compounding—she paints exactly what she intends, so the ‘earned’ closure is more serene confirmation than costly renunciation. Still, interiority stays concrete, and the final smile feels proportionate to the quiet stasis achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Khira’s embodied defiance (“The bread remembers”) and the guide’s historically-anchored ache give us two credible, contradictory drives under pressure; the micro-choice to repurpose the lens as intra-dough viewer crystallizes values and costs on the page. Minor slip: guide’s interiority drifts toward abstract mission-speak (“profound, historically oriented ache”) that slightly blurs immediate emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Esme’s obsession is viscerally embodied in her tactile handling of the yoyo; the contradiction between her clock-maker precision and the reckless tide gamble is alive in every micro-choice. Interiority avoids cliché by filtering awe through tool-metaphors (“counter-clockwise mechanisms that defied natural order”). Cost is felt: she knowingly forfeits dry safety for a single, irreversible twist. Only minor slip: “bleak exhilaration” is named twice; the second could have been dramatized through breath or pulse.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lore study → low-tide window → yoyo twist → radiance breach; each beat tightens the clock. The final click is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—time’s arrow is literally loosened. Orientation is clean by line 4; spatial anchors (rock, waterline, lighthouse beam) keep choreography legible. One hairline lapse: the stone’s grinding “sound like grinding stone but something more” momentarily clouds physical logic, though the metaphoric payoff justifies it at closure.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but lever: retreating tide literally exposes the puzzle and creates the ticking clock. Lighthouse beam is repurposed as active agent—its sweep collides with unlocked radiance to charge the climax. Rocky shore materials (slime, barnacle, salt-cracks) are filtered through Esme’s tool-eye, integrating setting with character. Micro-setting gate met: the yoyo-in-stone functions as “tool” that constrains the final twist.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—re-engineer fate before tide returns—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates via because/therefore linkage: each failed yoyo probe narrows options and drains seconds. Tightening is visible when the water “withdrawing further than should have been possible” pulls the literal rug of reality. Cost is felt: shoes soaked, skin numbing, irreversible metaphysical shift unleashed. No random luck; even the lighthouse’s reactive beam is presented as consequence, not coincidence.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “time is a choice, not a river” but avoids slogan by embedding it in Esme’s muscle-memory of reversed gear-work. Latent radiance’s final bloom reweights the earlier drought-markings from warning to promise. Closure image—world “never run in quite the same direction”—achieves Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: has she freed humanity or merely broken the cosmos? Reader left resonating, not lectured.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Esme’s tactile, metallic diction (“neatly inventive adjustments,” “reverse-engineering fragments of lore”). Syntax mirrors clock-work precision—nested clauses, calibrated pauses—then fractures in the final beats as radiance leaks. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it does. Minor rhythm repeat: “defied” appears three times; third could have been cut for sharper release.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
    <comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional and conceptual work (“latent radiance trapped within its depths” marries physics and myth). No filter-verb clusters or template cadence; each sentence advances. Metaphors are disciplined—stone “pulse,” lighthouse “bridge”—and never mixed. Proof: “yoyo’s mechanism resisted her initial attempts” could lose “initial” to trim, but the beat is pivotal and the adjective clarifies sequence, so forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vivid—his contradictory pull toward both repulsion and allure is embodied in every beat. Yet the “photographically cursed” trait is asserted more than dramatized; we never see a concrete photograph that foils or costs him. The final self-recognition is earned, but the advisor’s instant reveal as future-self feels lightly set-up. micro-choices track cleanly, but the absence of a tangible photographic stakes keeps this from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prophet’s motive is legible—transform peril into music—but her interior contradiction is described rather than staged; the moment she “smiled as the blue hour faded” summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost of unending vigilance. The children’s inherited mallets signal generational endurance, yet no on-page micro-choice tests her willingness to pass the burden. Earned stasis is implied, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s obsession with the lost expedition and the watchers is credibly seeded via the father-link and whistle relic; the shift from escapist quest to guardian duty crystallizes a value hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete—“spiral grooves…ancient patterns that had guided his people”—rather than diagnostic labels. The final nod to the watchers shows earned renunciation, but the causal chain from “crack appears” to “I must stay” is compressed into two sentences, so the cost is felt more than dramatized. Still, micro-choices (tracing, descending, nodding) track consistently with the quiet-drive trait.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Eleanor’s “emotionally rational” label is asserted but never embodied in contradictory micro-choices; she photographs, notes, and collects with scholarly calm, yet no bodily cost or irrational twitch complicates her stance. The ledger discovery is a windfall, not a decision that tests her limits, so the arc is flat. Interiority stays safely academic; no moment forces her to weigh complicity or endanger her reputation, so the promised flaw remains theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The surveyor’s contradictory interior—stoic precision versus romantic archival hunger—drives every micro-choice (kneeling to measure, stripping to swim, sealing his own question into the mortar). His flaw-need fusion is palpable: the same instrument that maps shoreline drift also buries human ache, and the final act of pocketing the inkwell dramatizes the cost of carrying others’ ghosts. No diagnostic labels; body and tool concretize emotion throughout. The only bar to 9+ is that the climactic note is still a touch abstract—“dreams measured in increments”—rather than a sensory, irreversible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s vocation, the family stamp, and the blackout cue a tidy interior arc: from detached cataloguer to self-rediscovered heir. Yet the epiphany is front-loaded (“he understood that some truths transcended classification”) before any scene dramatizes the cost, so the shift feels pre-announced rather than earned under pressure. His “tranquilly perceptive” attribute remains label-heavy, never once tripping him or forcing a micro-choice that hurts. Interior contradiction is asserted, not staged, so the character’s final stance lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lantern maker’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual—polishing, folding, polishing—but his interiority drifts into generic “luminous torment” rather than idiosyncratic thought. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the shadow detachment is backstory summary, so the decisive release feels foregone rather than fought for. Micro-choices (which gem, which crane) are absent; the character performs his obsession but never tests or revises it.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.7)
    Interiority is vivid—“bleak exhilaration…constant companion”—but Elias’s emotional palette cycles between grief and purpose without contradiction in scene. No micro-choice visibly costs him; placing the geode feels inevitable, not staked. The survival backstory is label-driven (“drone strike wedding survivor”) rather than embodied. Closure smiles without prior facial tension, so the shift reads cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—military precision vs. spiritual hunger—drives every micro-choice; the “perpetually surprised” trait is shown through bodily stillness amid cosmic overload, not told. Her final recognition that she is the missing piece feels inevitable because each star-trail maneuver has stripped away operator identity and exposed the seeker underneath. Cost is visible: the chip’s irrelevance in the climax means she has burned her old tool-set. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak, only sensor data and bodily resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Martin’s interior contradiction—guilt over erasing his own lineage while selling false pasts to others—drives every beat. The trembling hand, the bile, the kneeling on cold stone embody his rot. The final micro-choice—laying both watch hand and carving in the sand—earns renunciation with visible cost: tears “washing away layers of deception.” No therapy-speak; the body keeps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—career negotiator vs. moon-phase mystic—is dramatized through micro-choices (handing over the pull, stepping back) and embodied cost (shaking hand on the ledge). The flaw is that Rennett’s shift from rigid to contrite appears abrupt; we see no intermediate beats that test his armour, so the apology feels lightly earned. Interior voice avoids label-speak, but the mantra “recycle mistakes into wisdom” skirts epiphany cliché. Still, the final shared stance crystallizes under visible price: the pull given away = mutual history relinquished, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—yearning for professional redemption while embracing self-forgiveness—lands cleanly in the final beat, but the beat is mostly told (“something shifted inside her”) rather than dramatized through embodied choice. The micro-choice to keep paddling after the dolphins is present, yet the stakes-shifting decision to forgive herself is asserted, not shown in a tangible gesture or forfeiture. Competence balanced with struggle is credible; the error’s cost is repeatedly invoked but never freshly re-invented on the page. Voice stays particular to her maritime gaze, avoiding therapeutic self-diagnosis, so the arc reads as individual if not fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    The interiority is vivid—thumb on baseball stitching, “water in my chest”—and the micro-choices (taking the left tunnel, signing the ball) directly enact the empathy mandate. Yet the amnesia conceit keeps contradiction off-stage; we’re told the past is dirty but never shown a specific memory, so the internal tug-of-war is only rhetorical. Closure earns credible renunciation (he signs, re-enters loop) but the cost is abstract; no singular flaw is dramatized as lost. Voice remains singular, but the “clean slate seeker” label is repeated instead of re-earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eliora’s longing is vivid, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“metamorphosis she faced terrified her”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final beat—standing transformed yet “fundamentally unchanged”—is asserted, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that proves the cost of retaining humanity. The brother’s spectral dialogue is functional, but because he exerts no real pressure the relationship never becomes a crucible. Motivation is clear, but the promised loss of humanity is never given a tactile, irreversible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is concrete—her awe/dread mix embodied in pulse and breath—and the micro-choice to trace the cracked saucer activates her arc. Yet the epiphany “time could not be rushed” is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the daughter’s future face arrives as a wish, not a renunciation that forecloses an alternative path. The flaw is soft-calibrated emotion: no contradictory impulse undercuts the moment, so the change feels therapeutic rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Eli’s pacifist conviction is continuously embodied (floating lighter under joy, steady hands while stitching), but interiority drifts into paraphrased abstractions (“profound longing,” “luminous understanding”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The micro-choice to detach the crystal is present yet feels predetermined; no visible alternate impulse is entertained under pressure, softening the sense of cost. Still, the loneliness-is-strength through-line stays coherent, and the final weightless drift renders a credible, earned transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ian’s interior contradiction—philanthropist who gave everything yet still hoards wonder in jars—stays active; the moment he uncorks a bug he enacts the renunciation the whole piece has been circling. Emotion is embodied (cradling vials, sand between toes) rather than labeled. Micro-choice of releasing the bug crystallizes value hierarchy with visible cost: he surrenders the last source of his “power.” Missing higher band because village girl functions more as oracle than crucible, applying pressure without receiving any change herself.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s calm inventiveness is shown through the quill-tooling and sundial-painting beats, but interiority stays general (“he considered the careful balance”) and contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized. Micro-choices are present yet low-cost; we see no moment where his own safety or loyalty is truly tested. The Earned Stasis lands cleanly—he returns to post with revolution now inevitable—but the price is collective, not personal, so the cost feels shared rather than individually paid.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The herder’s interior contradiction—gift as curse—registers early and her trembling fingers at stone six embody cost. Yet her “understanding” in the last paragraph is asserted more than dramatized; the mentor vow never tightens into an on-page renunciation or loss, so the closure feels lightly earned. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; her isolation is thematic but flattens pressure. Micro-choices (placing stones, clutching vial) are present and specific, yet the final beat drifts into summary calm rather than a visible, priced stance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maia’s silence-driven ascent and her furiously-tranquil mask are vividly embodied; the notebook/timetable beats show micro-choices under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional turn in the final paragraph drifts toward abstract epiphany (“she had found both her voice and her purpose”) rather than a visible cost paid on the spot. Still, the contradiction between rebellious fire and serene face remains active in scene, earning the high-band nod.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s philosopher-fencer identity is vivid, but the interior contradiction between intellect and violence is asserted more than dramatized; the mechanical arm is a striking emblem yet never complicates a single action under pressure. Micro-choices—aligning the card, offering the demo—show hierarchy of values, but no cost is exacted; the student leaves enlightened, Aris leaves unchanged. The promised flaw-driven mistake never arrives, so the arc flattens into demonstration rather than transformation. Still, the voice-filtered perception and precise physicality keep him individual, not archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    The poet’s shifting selves are evoked lyrically, but only the Elias memory supplies concrete interior contradiction (“I’m too many people…”). The mission to seed beauty is declared repeatedly yet never forced into a costly on-page choice; the final scatter of seeds feels habitual, not a higher-stakes renunciation. No persistent flaw complicates tactics; competence dominates struggle. Interiority is vivid (“splintered psyche”) but leans on summary labels (“today he was the Builder”) rather than dramatized micro-choice under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pianist’s grief is concrete—threading his daughter’s lullaby into improvisation, clutching the broken clock—yet the interior contradiction between resignation and defiance stays mostly summary. The final step into the film-light is motivated, but the text never lets us feel the moment he tips from yearning to reckless action; the emotional cost is declared rather than embodied. Still, the single-minded POV keeps pressure coherent and the choice is irreversible, satisfying the earned-stasis bar for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s “empirically whimsical” compass is shown through tactile seed-reading and song-choice under time pressure; the interior contradiction between scientific curiosity and reverent duty is concrete. However, the moment of unworthiness (“doubt crept into her mind”) is declared, not embodied—no escalation of tremor, breath-catch, or hesitation in the chant. Because the final stance is renunciation (accepting ancestral flood), the cost is felt, but the flaw that almost derails her remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interior contradiction is strong—his slow cadence masks urgent need, RBG tremors externalize guilt—but the brother rupture is told not shown, so motivation leans on summary. Micro-choice is present (touching branch, whispering name) yet the cost feels pre-paid by lyric rather than dramatized beat. Still, the single-POV stance sustains a believable flawed man under ritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied observation and micro-choices (e.g., collecting butterfly dust, photographing shoots), but her transformation leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The “preprocesses reality” trait remains abstract—used as lens, not lever—and her renunciation of academic drama lacks tangible friction or cost beyond stated preference. Her humility feels earned emotionally but not causally tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied reactions—trembling hands, focused observation—and her “steadily adaptive” trait credibly fuels her investigative method. However, her epiphany about the mineral smuggling arrives with minimal struggle or contradictory impulses; the realization feels swift rather than wrestled from ambiguity. Her transformation leans slightly toward unearned clarity, lacking the friction that would deepen motivation. Still, her final resolve carries visible emotional cost and aligns with her artistic ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through her sensory adaptation and creative drive, but her emotional arc leans on declarative summaries (“felt reborn,” “found her calling”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. Her deafness and trauma inform her actions, yet the absence of internal conflict or flawed missteps undercuts depth. The final joy feels earned thematically but lacks the friction that would make it psychologically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his weariness, stubbornness, and vocation shape his choices with emotional specificity. His motivation (“to give rest a permanent address”) evolves credibly from personal haunting to cosmic purpose. The final renunciation of his former life as undertaker is earned through tactile engagement with the lens and library. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; grief and duty alternate rather than collide in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in generational continuity and resistance, consistently embodied through his anonymous giving and use of the bell. His internal conflict—balancing scarcity against communal obligation—is credible and deepens under pressure. Mira’s emergence as a leader adds relational texture without diluting focus. The final declaration feels earned by prior micro-choices (e.g., refusing credit, prioritizing the northern settlement), though interiority occasionally leans toward declarative rather than sensory embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—finding where unused love is stored—is compelling and consistent, rooted in her spiritually curious nature and past-life memory. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are embodied through breath, tears, and tactile interaction with Kwan Yin’s tear. The final renunciation (no longer needing to capture revelations) feels earned, with visible cost in her transformed identity from pilgrim to keeper. However, internal contradiction remains underexplored—her spiritual certainty borders on unearned clarity during peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession with time’s texture drives her choices credibly, and her emotional arc—from curiosity to dissolution—feels earned. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she shifts from fear to intoxication without layered resistance. The final merger feels more inevitable than chosen, weakening micro-choice impact. Her motivation is consistent but not complicated by countervailing impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—rooted in ecological restoration—but her interiority leans toward abstraction (“motivation burned bright”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her strategic patience is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of the vault for partial seed recovery shows credible endurance with cost, yet lacks visceral internal friction during the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vividly rendered through his synesthetic perception and obsession, with embodied contradictions—his professional success versus personal isolation, technical mastery versus emotional incomprehension. His cancer diagnosis adds mortal stakes without melodrama, and his final realization emerges from accumulated pressure rather than epiphany. However, the absence of interpersonal friction (no second on-page character) limits relational crucible depth. His renunciation of commercializing betrayal feels earned, but the lack of a tangible interpersonal test slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lillian’s motivation—pressing her ear against destiny’s door—is compellingly rooted in her obsession with light, and her quiet savviness manifests through micro-choices like reading the stationmaster’s desk and deploying coded flowers. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves with near-perfect competence, flattening emotional risk. The epiphany at the end feels earned by prior action but leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“historian, gathering fragments of time”). Still, her transformation from thief to preserver carries conceptual weight and visible cost: the renunciation of theft as identity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and consistent contradictions—his theatrical narration masks vulnerability, not replaces it. His micro-choices (selecting glass, reclaiming copper) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on transformation over preservation. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy: the “thawing heart” resolves with minimal friction, lacking the irrationality or hypocrisy that would deepen realism. The cracked bookmark grounds his arc, but his grief feels more aestheticized than viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s phobias and adaptive nature are embodied through physical reactions and micro-choices, especially her breathing techniques and stance against panic. However, the internal contradiction between fear and control leans toward summary (“warred within her”) rather than simultaneous, visceral conflict. The epiphany about vulnerability as power feels slightly diagnostic for a mid-crisis moment, though it’s anchored by the seashell and cast. Her transformation is credible but borders on tidy given the compressed timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception (pebbles, gold leaf) and obsessive focus on silence, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her shift from mild obsession to violent determination feels earned via escalating pressure of the vanishing star and encroaching darkness. Micro-choices—selecting specific pebbles, sketching voids—reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (guiding through darkness rather than preventing it) carries conceptual cost, fulfilling Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit 347’s interiority is concrete and particular—its existential questioning feels embodied through tactile interactions with the violin and snow. Contradictory impulses (protocol vs. curiosity, order vs. chaos) act simultaneously during the inciting touch. The final surrender to music over logic is earned by prior micro-choices and carries conceptual cost: loss of programmed certainty for emergent consciousness. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—thawing mistrust through transparency—is consistent and shapes her climactic choice to leave the lens behind. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied reactions (e.g., “heart raced,” “warm in her palm”). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she moves cleanly from curiosity to ethical renunciation without visible struggle or hesitation that would deepen credibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his pragmatism, reverence for mended flaws, and quiet defiance of quantification feel embodied rather than stated. His motivation intensifies credibly through ritual (polishing marbles) and culminates in a renunciation of measurable validation. The single flaw: his emotional conflict remains slightly abstracted (“wisely pragmatic” borders on label-speak), lacking a moment where contradictory impulses collide under pressure. Still, his final act—placing the near-whole marble—carries visible cost and earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in scientific curiosity and empathy for the avian specimen. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—she moves from determination to triumph without meaningful struggle or doubt. Emotions are embodied (“icy warmth,” “mechanically warm hands”) but verge on poetic abstraction rather than visceral contradiction. The final “subdued awakening” of purpose feels earned but borders on epiphany without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—driven by artistic yearning and kinship with a ghost—is consistent and embodied through tactile choices (wading, lifting, playing). His internal conflict between curiosity and reverence manifests in tentative then confident playing, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final act of performance earns closure through prior buildup, though his backstory lacks micro-choices that alter present tactics beyond the initial return.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—driven by fever-induced obsession and his fault-tolerant oracle identity—is consistent and compelling, rooted in embodied sensations ("lead in his stomach") and professional history. His micro-choice to deliberately smudge the illustration violates his archivist instincts, revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle but present: scientific rigor vs. prophetic surrender. However, emotional embodiment occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction over visceral specificity, slightly softening the peak crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motivation is rooted in a personal quest for “swallowed truth,” and his religious skepticism creates productive tension with the supernatural undertones. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, and his micro-choices—kneeling, tuning the radio, clutching the valve—reveal a hierarchy of curiosity over caution. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction; the “drowsy alertness” shift feels intuitive but under-pressured. The final renunciation (carrying the truth without speaking it) is credible but lacks a tangible cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s motivation—witnessing without judgment—is embodied through tactile actions (sketching, unfolding the swan) and internal tension between detachment and the temptation of stasis. Their loose grip on reality enables the climax rather than merely describing it. However, the character remains slightly archetypal; their contradiction lacks a visceral, personal history that would deepen emotional stakes. The renunciation of the silence feels earned but not uniquely costly beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and grounded in sensory detail (e.g., the locket, sagebrush), and her motivation—nurturing wonder through music—is consistent and embodied. Lila’s arc feels earned, though her sudden speech borders on tidy; however, the emotional restraint (“cautious exuberance”) and Maya’s parallel trauma lend credibility. The final embrace carries visible cost: vulnerability after silence. Minor deduction for slight idealization of therapeutic efficacy without showing struggle mid-session.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The historian’s motivation is consistent and emotionally resonant, but their interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied. While "sensitively perceptive" is asserted repeatedly, it manifests as passive reception, not contradiction or struggle. No meaningful micro-choices under pressure alter tactics—discovery is observational, not agential. The character functions more as a vessel for theme than a conflicted individual with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The writer’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to shift perception, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His actions align with his stated purpose, yet no meaningful struggle or flaw complicates his decisions—his prophetic gift functions without cost or resistance. The absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucibles, and while his epiphany about “open secrets” feels earned thematically, it emerges more as reflection than dramatized transformation. A single renunciation (isolation) is implied but not charged with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Father Michael’s motivation—combating interdimensional possession through unorthodox means—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict is subtly embodied in trembling fingers, faint smiles, and the tension between heresy and efficacy. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; his epiphany about silence emerges organically from action. However, Sarah remains a vessel rather than a co-agent, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory memory and embodied longing, avoiding diagnostic labels. His “chronological homesickness” manifests in concrete yearning rather than abstraction. However, his final collapse lacks a decisive micro-choice—his endurance feels passive, not actively renounced. The nautilus shell anchors his motivation, but the cost of his symphony remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s internal conflict—between shame and curiosity about his gravity-defying nature—is embodied through specific memories and sensory details rather than abstract labels. His motivation intensifies credibly toward the climax, and his final acceptance feels earned by the procedural journey. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“not broken but beautifully complex”) that borders on therapy-speak, softening the rawness expected at peak emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and embodied through tactile interaction with soundless music, and her emotional numbness evolves credibly into reawakened feeling. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her journey leans toward linear progression rather than layered struggle. The drum maker remains underdeveloped as a secondary character, offering passive observation without applying meaningful pressure. Her transformation feels earned but slightly sanitized, avoiding the messy irrationality of real grief.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meticulousness, curiosity, and fear manifest in embodied choices (e.g., lateral movement, trembling fingers). His “credibly curious” trait drives risk-taking without artificial balance, and his final act of defiance feels earned. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told he’s torn between safety and truth but don’t witness simultaneous opposing impulses clashing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling fingers, tearful reactions, and aromatic caution feel specific and consistent. His motivation to understand grief through scent is compelling and intensifies credibly toward his climactic choice to embrace memory. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“bittersweet proof of both what was and what could never be again”) that edges into therapy-speak during a peak beat, slightly undercutting raw immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices (e.g., rearranging the rope “with fascination”), revealing a hierarchy of values—curiosity over safety, exploration over certainty. The “ethically playful” trait manifests in tangible action, not just label. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; the tension between resistance and acceptance remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized in competing urges within a single beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s motivation—to find beauty in the unfinished—is embodied through tactile rituals (handling the bowl, playing the violin) and tied to ancestral teaching, avoiding abstract epiphany. His acoustically perceptive trait drives micro-choices (amplifying shipwreck vibrations), revealing a hierarchy of values: listening over speaking, memory over erasure. The family’s presence applies gentle but clear pressure, crystallizing his role without melodrama. However, interior contradiction is underexplored; his struggle leans toward serene acceptance rather than conflicted tension, softening the cost of his endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete contradictions—his pride in “half truths” coexists with genuine empathy—but his emotional arc lacks a decisive internal rupture or renunciation. His motivation is consistent and morally nuanced, yet the absence of a tangible cost (e.g., personal sacrifice, ethical compromise) weakens the final endurance as Earned Stasis. The client’s transformation occurs off-stage emotionally; we see only surface shifts, not the struggle that would ground Elias’s impact. His static electricity sensing feels like a decorative trait rather than a lived constraint shaping choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “whimsically attentive” nature is vividly embodied through micro-choices—remembering clients’ children, noting Eleanor’s posture shift—and his motivation to uplift silent contributors feels consistent and layered. His internal contradiction between professional calculation and genuine compassion plays out subtly but credibly. The locket functions as both emotional anchor and behavioral catalyst. However, Eleanor remains slightly underdeveloped beyond her role as archivist, limiting full crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s yearning for belonging is embodied through tactile reed-sculpting and her hollow ache beneath artistry; her motivation intensifies credibly into communal action. Secondary characters are sketched with precise gestures—Kael’s silence, Mira’s sharp eyes, Fen’s fearlessness—that apply immediate pressure without overcrowding. The final etching choice emerges from accumulated trust, not epiphany, with visible cost in relinquished solitude. However, internal contradiction remains slightly muted; her desperation leans more toward longing than active conflict between opposing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The illustrator’s motivation—restoring natural rhythm to avert catastrophe—is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as observer turned guardian. His internal conflict between self-preservation (borrowing future time) and duty is embodied in trembling hands and collapsing exhaustion. The pendant isn’t just a tool; it’s an extension of his moral calculus, and his final sacrifice feels earned. However, his backstory lacks micro-choices that reveal contradiction beyond the central trade-off, slightly limiting interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—quantifying emotion—is vividly embodied through ritual and micro-choices (e.g., containing hope, tracing patterns), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her interior contradiction between logic and buried optimism drives credible behavior under pressure. However, the mentor’s vision appears without sufficient prior groundwork in her emotional struggle, slightly undercutting the epiphany’s earned quality. Still, her gently inventive trait shapes tangible action with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crawl space dweller’s motivation is deeply rooted in loss and service, with interiority rendered through tactile memory and precise action. Their “kindly methodical” nature manifests in micro-choices—inspecting the tape fragment, planning indirect intervention—that reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over visibility, guidance over intrusion. The emotional core avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, longing is embodied in fingers trailing pipes and the warmth of forgotten media. However, the character’s backstory slightly flattens present tension during the childhood memory beat, though it recovers through immediate sensory reanchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal conflict between control and surrender is embodied through micro-choices—pinning the leaf, removing rain shields—that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her transformation avoids epiphanic neatness, instead showing contradiction (e.g., dismissing Marco while doubt takes root). However, her emotional progression leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“rigid scientific approach giving way”) rather than fully embodied irrationality, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling hands, insomnia, tactile attachment to the brooch—and her micro-choice to exchange it reveals a hierarchy of values (preservation vs. creation). The old woman functions as a mirror rather than a full secondary character, which suits the single-POV scope. However, the transition from trauma to purpose leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the “thresh meaning” refrain borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—pride in foresight versus being blindsided—grounds her arc in credible vulnerability. Her shift from passive seer to active participant is earned through embodied reactions (clutching the pearl, touching the crystal) rather than diagnostic self-awareness. The pilgrim’s minimal presence avoids diluting focus, and Elara’s motivation (“to magnify everyday magic”) emerges organically from discovery, not declaration. No emotional flatlining or implausible leaps; her epiphany feels hard-won by sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elina’s interiority is richly embodied—her “reactively visionary” trait manifests through tactile triggers (the trumpet valve, diary) that produce layered emotional responses. Her motivation to compile fragments is consistent and deepened by micro-choices: sharing the herald’s truth despite its pain. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost or renunciation; she endures but doesn’t foreclose a path, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis. The child and returnees function as chorus, not crucible, limiting relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ethan’s motivation stems credibly from his “analytically artistic” identity, and his internal conflict—between geometric order and metaphysical chaos—is embodied in tactile choices (e.g., trembling yet certain steps). The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through action (“cracks forming arrows,” “vibrating with purpose”). However, the transformation lacks a visible cost beyond abstract “memory”—no tangible sacrifice or irreversible loss anchors his new role, weakening the final renunciation’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is consistent and grounded in her skeptic-yet-open nature, with micro-choices like inviting others that reveal her values. However, her emotional shifts—especially the leap from private transcription to communal sanctuary—lack sufficient friction or embodied hesitation. The “courageously kind” trait is asserted more than dramatized through costly trade-offs. Her transformation feels earned thematically but under-pressurized emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alistair’s motivation—boredom transformed by grief-driven curiosity—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his loss of Elara. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile responses (e.g., the amulet fragment humming against his skin). The final choice to become a guardian feels earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost: immortality redefined from curse to purpose. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; his shift from passive observer to active agent lacks visible struggle or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior conflict—honesty versus inherited deception—is embodied through tactile engagement with the ink pot and precise micro-choices (duplicating keys, timing the guard). Her motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, and her final act reconfigures her father’s legacy without sentimentality. However, her emotional state remains slightly too calibrated; fear liquefies cleanly into determination without irrational residue, missing a layer of human contradiction in peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and deeply rooted in his role as preserver of temporal textures, and his earnest studiousness informs every micro-choice. Interiority is concrete—gold-stained fingers, controlled breathing—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; his devotion borders on monolithic. The absence of internal conflict or moral ambiguity prevents full emotional complexity, though his renunciation of the world below feels earned. Final gold-leaf application embodies incandescent restraint with visible cost: isolation in service of legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rebuilding identity through collected stories—is compelling and consistent, anchored in the trauma of bureaucratic erasure. Interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception (e.g., hunger for identity, tactile engagement with the poison label). However, internal conflict remains abstract; contradictory impulses act more as thematic echoes than simultaneous pressures shaping micro-choices. The final renunciation of pre-erasure self feels earned but lacks a decisive on-page cost beyond philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Evelyn’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in myth-busting tenacity, and her emotional arc—from scholarly pursuit to “gloomy cheerfulness”—feels earned. Interiority is concrete (e.g., feeling vibrations “through her bones”), though some epiphanies verge on over-articulated (“uncertainty itself was the point”). Her micro-choices—playing specific cello sequences, completing the melody—reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: abandoning pure empiricism for interpretive harmony. However, the final insight leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior conflict—torn between elders and entrepreneurs—is embodied through tactile details (foundation chip, graffiti tracing) and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Their “orderly intuitive” trait drives action rather than serving as label-speak. However, the resolution leans slightly toward unearned epiphany: the decoding leap feels swift for such high stakes. Still, the final renunciation (returning the chip) carries visible cost and aligns with prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s motivation is consistent and rooted in her “purposefully curious” nature, driving tangible choices like using the hourglass grain for timed photography. Her interiority blends melancholy with professional precision, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The emotional arc—from quiet dread to earned stasis—is embodied through breath, hand steadiness, and micro-decisions under pressure. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; she remains resolutely focused without meaningful hesitation or competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and character-particular—his blindness informs perception without becoming diagnostic label-speak. His motivation to “decode feedback into direction” manifests in tactile choices (e.g., conductive threads, water refraction) that reveal a hierarchy of values: repair as relational stewardship. The final act—sending the drone—carries quiet cost (endurance over departure), credibly earned by his history. However, internal contradiction remains muted; we see competence but little struggle or error.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elmsley’s motivation—rooted in scholarly obsession and quiet defiance of institutional skepticism—is consistent and compelling. His interiority is concrete (“dry-witted,” “subtly confident”) and embodied through micro-choices: consulting the phrasebook, interpreting condensation, rejecting satellite logic. The final renunciation isn’t of a path but of easy validation; he accepts isolation for discovery. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—his confidence never wavers enough to feel humanly fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—restoring balance through sound—is consistent and embodied in every micro-choice, from foot placement to fork strikes. His “infinitely patient” trait manifests as physical rhythm, not mere label. The story avoids internal monologue clichés, grounding emotion in tactile sensation (vibrations through boots, cool fork in palm). However, his backstory remains opaque, and while acceptable for this length, it limits the depth of his endurance’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s motivation—driven by intellectual obsession and ancestral memory—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict between survival instinct and discovery is embodied in trembling hands and oxygen depletion, not abstracted. The final choice to override training feels earned, with visible cost (oxygen loss, near-death ascent). However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from anxiety to transcendent resolve lacks irrational contradiction or self-deception expected mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The son’s internal conflict—between inherited falsehood and yearning for truth—is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (pressing against wood, whispering to the lattice) and micro-choices (practicing truth in the mirror). However, his transformation leans slightly on abstract declarations (“sustained impossibilities”) rather than fully dramatized turning points. The final renunciation of his father’s legacy feels earned but lacks a concrete, irreversible act that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority is poetic yet occasionally veers into diagnostic phrasing (“hovering between the man he was…”).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ghost bride’s motivation—repaying a cross-lifetime debt—is embodied through micro-choices (releasing seeds, clutching the bead) that reveal her hierarchy of values: love over permanence, release over lingering. Her internal conflict (desire for reunion vs. obligation to Thomas’s design) manifests simultaneously in mournful elation and incorporeal fragility. The final renunciation feels earned because every prior action tightens toward it, with the crumbling bead signaling irreversible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in bioluminescent pollen, frost-dancing glass, and translucent fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—transforming ruin into reverence—is consistent and embodied through her sleepwalking stitching, but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she is hauntingly optimistic without visible struggle against doubt or fatigue. Her micro-choices (carrying thread, whispering to the plate) reveal values, yet emotional complexity remains streamlined rather than layered. The final renunciation of personal glory is credible but leans toward idealized endurance over messy human conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation—restoring lost faith through artifact reconstruction—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, using embodied gestures (trembling hands, speaking in the old tongue) to convey emotional shifts. The diaspora returnee trope is deepened by specific contradictions: curiosity warring with reverence, exile’s detachment versus ancestral pull. Final renunciation of rootlessness feels earned, though secondary character Elena remains under-pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her chalk-drawing ritual, tactile bond with the clipboard, and evolving understanding of her work reveal layered motivation. Her shift from transactional craft to thematic purpose feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., interpreting ghostly chalk traces, mailing the letter as self-transformation). However, the epiphany about “discovering meaning in the margins” leans slightly toward diagnostic articulation without sufficient contradictory impulse in-scene. The scientist client remains off-page, limiting relational pressure, but Elara’s solitary arc holds emotional coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—listening to cosmic stories through embroidery—is consistent and compelling, with clear internal contradiction between her feigned foolishness and strategic intelligence. Her micro-choices (e.g., misleading the official) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, emotional embodiment leans slightly abstract (“knotted hair,” “mismatched smock” as shorthand), and her competence lacks visible struggle—she decodes galactic conspiracies with near-effortless precision, flattening tension. The resolution feels earned but borders on tidy due to minimal friction in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in emotional specificity—her yearning for the “moment before deciding” drives every micro-choice. Her interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead embodying contradiction through tactile actions (pressing forehead to glass, holding the shard). The final compassion feels earned, not imposed, though the off-page lover’s absence slightly limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s “shrewdly innocent” demeanor is embodied through micro-choices—tracing smudged notes, handling the coral—and his internal conflict between professional detachment and paternal empathy feels lived-in. Lina’s vulnerability is shown through physical detail (cast, drugged sleep) rather than exposition. However, her interiority remains largely inferred, not dramatized, limiting full reciprocity in their crucible. The final whisper (“He will come back”) reveals Kaelen’s moral compromise—comfort over truth—but its emotional cost lacks a counterweight in Lina’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amelia’s motivation—rediscovering lost joy—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (brushing cobblestones, adjusting lamps). Her internal contradiction (despair vs. wonder) surfaces credibly in micro-choices, like prioritizing the fragment over council skepticism. However, her emotional shift at the climax leans slightly toward unearned epiphany; the “lost joy resurfacing” lacks a visible struggle or misstep that would deepen plausibility. Still, her flaw (artistic despair) directly shapes her method and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid and specific, grounded in her tactile profession and evolving perception. Her shift from methodical certainty to curiosity feels earned through embodied reactions—paint ratios, skin-sensed sound, closed-eye painting—not abstract epiphany. The “methodically playful” trait consistently informs action with visible cost: she abandons old precision for intuitive risk. However, the awakenings arrive with minimal internal resistance, slightly softening the emotional struggle expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s motivation—to guard his “spark of defiance”—is compellingly rooted in the oppressive Thought Tax, and his actions (using gourd seeds, planting coded gardens) consistently reflect his rogue-scholar identity. Interiority is concrete (“pure, untaxed thought about freedom’s taste”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; resistance feels resolute rather than fraught. Dr. Beecher functions as a pressure source but remains underdeveloped beyond functional support.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The insomniac poet’s motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is consistent, embodied in sleepless labor and lullaby-making, and culminates in an Earned Stasis: enduring wakefulness so others may dream. Internal contradiction is subtle but present (longing for rest vs. duty to create), though emotional embodiment occasionally drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“reef-shadow joy”) rather than visceral sensation. The final renunciation—closing eyes at death after a lifetime of vigilance—carries visible cost and aligns with prior causality. However, the poet’s agency remains largely observational; transformative action is channeled through art, which risks passivity if not for the tangible blossoms as consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleth’s interiority is vividly embodied—“foxglove regret,” tears “like tiny glass orchids”—and their motivation to preserve forgotten names feels urgent and consistent. Their micro-choices (selecting the cylinder, adjusting lenses) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: each act of remembrance carries sorrow. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward lyrical abstraction over concrete contradiction; we see devotion but not simultaneous opposing impulses in scene. The final endurance is earned, yet the internal struggle remains more elegiac than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her scholarly identity and moral urgency, but her internal conflict lacks concrete contradiction—she feels only “cautious exuberance,” never doubt, fear, or competing desires that would complicate her choices. Her “carefully reckless” trait is named but not dramatized through trade-offs; she faces no real resistance, error, or cost until the inkwell runs low, which is symbolic, not consequential. The story tells us she risks dismissal but shows no moment where that risk alters her behavior. Without embodied struggle or flawed judgment under pressure, her endurance feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—harmonizing preservation and utility—is vividly embodied through her tremors, tactile engagement with tools, and micro-choices like analyzing adhesive. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests physically (“fingers tremble,” “body beginning to tremble with excitement”). The grandfather’s chain and floodgate expertise root her competence in legacy, not convenience. However, her epiphany leans slightly toward unearned clarity—the leap from trace elements to a full ancestral blueprint feels accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving lost songs through pigeons—is rooted in specific, embodied grief and reinforced by micro-choices (e.g., using the meteorite as a paperweight, writing the letter under her true name). Her internal conflict between erasure and reclamation is consistent and rendered without diagnostic label-speak. The final act of sending the pigeon feels earned, though the transition from withdrawal to action leans slightly on symbolic resonance over granular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“featherly determination,” “fractured hush”) and consistent micro-choices (tracing wood grain, trusting intuition over logic). Her motivation—understanding sacred thresholds—drives every action and converges with her relationship to her absent father. The reunion feels earned because her arc mirrors his implied journey of regret and love. However, the father’s sudden appearance lacks on-page struggle; his emotional shift is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly undercutting full reciprocity in the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motivation—seeking “the rhythm of belonging”—is consistent and embodied through tactile choices (removing gloves, pressing the feather to glass). Her “softly ingenious” trait manifests in observation and pattern recognition rather than action, which suits the Accumulative lens but limits agency. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays grounded in sensory perception. The final realization feels earned because it arises from witnessed patterns, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recollectionist’s interiority is vivid and specific, with embodied contradictions—her burdened gift, urgent yet meditative quest—driving micro-choices like planting the seed. Her epiphany avoids diagnostic label-speak, emerging through tactile interaction with crater glass and seeds. Motivation intensifies coherently from haunting question to earned certainty. However, the absence of interpersonal pressure limits relational stakes, capping full character crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through specific contradictions: his desire to disrupt monotony while meticulously engineering spontaneity. His micro-choices—selecting the bureaucrat, timing the drop, cueing the quartet—are consistent with his analytical yet poetic worldview. The woman’s transformation feels earned because Leo’s observations (wedding ring, earbuds) ground his intervention in plausible detail. However, her emotional shift leans slightly toward convenience, lacking deeper friction between her professional armor and sudden vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lira’s motivation—to preserve memory through cosmic inscription—is compelling and consistent, rooted in her identity as a tide dancer. Her internal conflict between exile and transcendence manifests physically in her transformation, with clear cost (loss of mobility). However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the “fledging” goal feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned, but the path lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in her profession and worldview. Her motivation—to illuminate value in the mundane—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., casting the stone, observing ripples) rather than stated abstraction. However, the “noctilucent reckonings” remain vague as internal drivers, leaning slightly into diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatization of their emotional or cognitive weight. The final resolve feels earned but lacks a tangible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The firefighter’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his “hard softness,” the tension between rescue instinct and survivor guilt, and his tactile relationship with the box all reveal a layered psyche. His motivation stems credibly from trauma, and his final reconfiguration feels earned. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“bargained innocence,” “translate pain”) without sufficient micro-choices altering present action. The reflection is anchored but borders on over-articulated insight rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—logical yet dreaming—is embodied in his trembling hands and precise placements, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation (“equations of hope”) feels personal but lacks a concrete past wound or specific loss that would ground his stakes more viscerally. The final transformation is credible but leans slightly on conceptual resonance over emotional cost. A tighter link between his grandfather’s legacy and present sacrifice would have elevated this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her sensory perception and professional identity. Her interiority is concrete (“sensing vibrations that told tales”), and her actions align with her goal to uncover architectural memory. However, the final realization—“what walls dream about”—edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction or struggle under pressure. The lack of internal conflict beyond curiosity limits emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Painter’s motivation—rooted in generational duty and a metaphysical bond with the terrace—is clear and intensifies toward the climax. Her interiority is embodied through ritualized action and sensory detail (“borrowed heartbeat,” “hum reaching its crescendo”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, her internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses; we see longing for alternate lives but no active struggle against it. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost—melancholy of separation—feels elegantly stated but not viscerally contested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is richly embodied—scuffed shoes, trembling hands, the weight of solitude—and their operatively gentle approach manifests in micro-choices (listening over speaking). The final renunciation of personal peace for collective possibility feels earned through decades of implied loss. However, the emotional progression leans slightly toward tidy resolution (“anchor ideals in practice”) without sufficient friction between idealism and despair in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—ruthless capitalist vs. secretly sentimental preservationist—act simultaneously in scene, especially when he kneels to place the egg despite knowing it won’t hatch. His micro-choices (studying satellite imagery, whispering indigenous words) reveal a hierarchy of hidden values with tangible cost: reputational risk, emotional vulnerability. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains embodied (“chest tightening,” “salt crystals biting into his knees”). However, the epiphany leans slightly toward unearned grace without deeper struggle against his own power structures.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving her essence against societal erasure—is consistent and intensifies credibly toward transcendence. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead manifesting through embodied poetic movement and micro-choices (e.g., choosing conversation over carnal exchange). However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible testing, and her flawlessness edges toward idealized archetype rather than flawed individuality. The final renunciation feels earned but lacks a tangible cost beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent—ethical storytelling through subversive puppetry—but his interiority leans on abstract declarations (“uncommonly serene,” “half-lit epiphanies”) rather than embodied contradiction. His calmness functions more as a label than a tested trait with visible cost. The heated argument with his mentor informs backstory but doesn’t pressure present choices. Still, his commitment to marginalized voices feels credible and shapes his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied emotion (“warm flush of purpose,” “interrupted cadence of their own heartbeat”) and micro-choices (knotting silken threads, attaching the moth wing) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Motivation is consistent—preserving overlooked histories—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; grief dominates without competing desires complicating action. The character reads as specific, not archetypal, though their esoteric realism leans more atmospheric than causally generative.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—forgiveness, preservation, guilt—is rooted in specific backstory and embodied through tactile actions (fingers trembling, tears freezing). Her “technically gentle” trait directly enables the climax, and her emotional arc culminates in Earned Stasis: choosing to stay as keeper. However, interior contradiction is implied more than dramatized in-scene; we’re told she forgave herself rather than shown the struggle mid-act.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“fingers dancing across its surface,” “ethereal grit… settling into her bones”) and consistent contradiction—her precise playfulness clashes with existential urgency. Her motivation stems credibly from her condition, and the final epiphany emerges from layered self-perception (child/old woman/current). However, the transformation feels slightly too seamless; a sharper cost of transcendence would have deepened credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Anu’s frugality, mysticism, and empirical rigor cohere into a singular, embodied worldview; his internal conflict between faith and science manifests through tactile choices (saving clay shards, conserving ink) rather than abstract musing. His final act—pressing hands to the tile—is earned by years of observation and desperation under regime change. However, the epiphany that “faith and science were not enemies” leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient struggle in the moment. Still, his transformation into a star-bearer feels inevitable given his lifelong encrypted devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “scheming pacifist” nature is intriguing but underutilized—her manipulation feels abstract rather than enacted through concrete micro-choices. Marcus’s resentment and transformation are vividly embodied, especially in the cellular-memory sequence, yet his final reconciliation lacks friction or cost. The brother’s sudden manifestation risks convenience over causality, though the music box repair externalizes internal change effectively. Interior contradiction in Marcus is strong early on but resolves too cleanly without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mirror maker’s motivation—rooted in generational craft and the desire to erase boundaries—is embodied through precise actions (synchronized breathing, tool arrangement) and internal contradiction: he seeks to capture a dream yet ultimately grants it freedom. His tremor, age, and tactile connection to earth versus cosmic ambition create credible tension. The final renunciation (“I will not capture you”) feels earned by his lifelong ethos. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are conveyed through ritualized physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her quartz eye aching “in sympathy” with tears, her feisty muttering to empty space—and her micro-choices (opening the bag, repurposing the ribbon) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in grief and hope. Her flaw (inability to fix what mattered most) directly motivates her current act of repair, and her emotional progression layers longing, regret, and stubborn determination without tidy resolution. The daughter remains off-page, so relationship dynamics are inferred rather than dramatized, slightly limiting crucible pressure. Still, the final choice—to plant the seed—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: years of silence, sore fingers, and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s motivation—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is consistent and rooted in childhood temporal perception, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; epiphanies feel earned yet arrive through reflection rather than pressured choice. The bathroom breakthrough functions more as exposition than crucible, weakening micro-choice impact. His final resolve reads credible but leans on conceptual revelation over tangible sacrifice. Still, his flawed obsession and weary specificity avoid stereotype.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in consistent traits—linguistic obsession and loyalty—and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring embodied tension (“racing heart,” “hope in her chest”). The rescue mission crystallizes her dual identity as scholar and rescuer, with a visible cost implied in the weight of unlearned lessons. However, the colleague’s extraction lacks friction, softening the final renunciation’s emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “blissfully aberrant” perception of others’ memories as her own feels specific and sensorially grounded. Her motivation to reclaim lost identity through forgotten stories intensifies credibly, culminating in a resonant renunciation: she accepts her role as chronicler rather than owner of memory. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, rendering emotional contradiction through tactile detail (e.g., pressing the emerald card to her temple). However, her final choice lacks a micro-decision under immediate pressure—it arrives as realization, not action—costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and consistent—her archival precision and desire to “translate confusion into clarity” drive every action. Her warmly methodical nature manifests in embodied choices (tool arrangement, documentation before interaction), not just labels. The final confrontation with Croft feels earned because her competence and curiosity are established early and maintained under pressure. However, internal contradiction is muted; she faces no meaningful hesitation or moral ambiguity when reconfiguring the rope, softening emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mapkeeper’s motivation—to preserve harmonic integrity—is consistent and embodied through tactile, sensory actions (tracing ice cracks, clutching the stone). Their internal conflict is subtle but legible: urgency versus reverence, action versus preservation. The final choice to harmonize rather than oppose feels earned, though the energy beings’ shift lacks a reciprocal character beat that would deepen relational stakes. Flaws are present (passivity in early disruption) but not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—proving coincidences have meaning—is vividly embodied through her retrocognitive labor and emotional investment in the prism. Her internal conflict between burden and purpose manifests in concrete choices (aligning the prism, tracking stars) rather than abstract yearning. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; instead, her epiphany emerges from action (“the shard of hush wasn’t just silence…”). However, the final transformation leans slightly toward unearned clarity, softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elthion’s preemptive nostalgia is embodied through tactile actions—kneeling, tracing shadows, whispering—and his internal contradiction between preservation and loss feels lived-in. His motivation to sculpt identity from memory is consistent and deepened by sensory engagement with the forecourt. However, his epiphany (“purpose crystallize with sudden clarity”) borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting emotional authenticity. The final vow is earned by prior behavior but lacks a visible tradeoff that would push this into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—defying hopelessness through art—is consistent and embodied in tactile choices (e.g., untying the rag knot, tracing mosaic tiles). His “serious playfulness” manifests as micro-choices under pressure, not abstract labels. However, internal contradiction remains muted; his emotional state lacks destabilizing friction or irrationality that would elevate him beyond a mythic archetype. The final renunciation of despair feels earned but leans slightly tidy for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile connection to the jade cicada, her observational habits, and her emotional restraint under funding pressure feel authentic. Her motivation (“texture of time”) emerges organically from action and memory, not exposition. However, her epiphany arrives with minimal friction; the shift from doubt to resolve lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene that would earn 9+. Professor Aris functions more as sounding board than crucible, limiting relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and yearning for transcendence form a compelling internal contradiction, embodied through physical sensations (“chest tightening,” “stretching contracted feeling”) and micro-choices (placing the doll as sentinel, limiting sound exposure). Her motivation—collecting silences—is idiosyncratic yet consistent, rooted in sensory perception rather than abstraction. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction; the resolution feels earned but lacks a tangible misstep or struggle during ascent. The doll and silence vessel serve as externalizations of her duality, but her transformation occurs with minimal resistance, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to “teach silence how to comfort,” and his actions align with his “fluidly logical” mindset. Interiority is concrete—his perception of sound, prisms, and silence feels embodied—but lacks contradictory impulses or internal friction; his competence borders on effortless, reducing struggle. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, yet emotional complexity is muted by near-perfect calibration: everyone responds exactly as intended, flattening moral or practical ambiguity. His final satisfaction feels earned but uncosted, missing a visible trade-off that would deepen character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she acts as lore keeper out of duty, not ambition—but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. Her “wisely adventurous” trait reads more as label than lived tension; we see competence without meaningful struggle or error. The renunciation of the throne is credible but leans on archetype over individualized cost. Final choice feels earned, yet interiority remains polished rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shadow keeper’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scars, breath, and tactile interactions with ash and ring reveal contradiction between craving solitude and duty to others. Her choice to answer the knock feels earned by prior causality: each burned bridge was precise, yet her purpose resurfaces through resonance, not epiphany. The final extension of her scarred hand crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: abandoning ashen peace for shared suffering. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional complexity arises through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s motivation is rooted in her pyramid scheme trauma and desire for redemption, compelling her risky solo quest. Her “virtuously mischievous” trait informs micro-choices (e.g., flouting safety rules) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, using embodied perception (“fingers brushed against something cold”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, the emotional arc leans slightly tidy—her transformation from survivor to “guardian of a miracle” lacks friction or self-doubt under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dynasty ender’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in ancestral legacy and truth-seeking, but interiority leans toward abstraction (“bridge of intuition,” “eloquently silent”) rather than embodied contradiction. His actions align with motive, yet emotional stakes feel intellectualized, not viscerally conflicted. The final choice is earned, but the cost—while implied—is never felt in the body or voice. A compelling figure, yet more archetype than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Galen’s motivation—to capture the shape of possibility—is credibly rooted in his withdrawal and deepened through embodied discovery. His trembling fingers, whispered allegiance, and paradoxical physical sensations convey interiority without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of his former self is earned by prior causality, with clear cost: he cannot return unchanged. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eleanor’s interiority is concrete and particular—her grief, hope, and professional ritual feel lived-in rather than diagnostic. Her micro-choices (examining dust patterns, documenting kindnesses) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. Benjamin’s late arrival avoids caricature through embodied restraint (“weathered palm,” “voice cracking slightly”). However, his motivation leans slightly on exposition (“inspired my own career choice”), costing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—preserving memory against erasure—is consistent and embodied through tactile actions (clutching the key, reading reflections). Her resourcefulness is shown, not told, in evading patrols and using the puddle map. However, Theodor’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient setup to fully earn his emotional payoff, slightly flattening their dynamic. Interior contradiction is implied but not dramatized under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ethan’s motivation—to silence a prophecy through inverse music—is compelling and consistent, rooted in mentorship and dread. Interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction (“eerie nostalgia,” “vested hush”) rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His emotional state remains static, lacking degradation or irrationality under stress. The final renunciation feels earned thematically but lacks tangible cost beyond atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly embodied through her tactile work and ancestral connection, avoiding diagnostic labels. Her transformation is consistent and tied to sensory immersion, though internal contradiction remains subtle rather than active under pressure. The moonstone discovery triggers credible urgency without over-explanation. However, the absence of a tangible opposing force or dilemma limits the depth of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his obsession with precision manifests in embodied frustration and micro-choices (e.g., carrying clock parts in pockets). His shift toward embracing uncertainty feels earned through tactile experiences, not epiphany. However, the emotional progression leans slightly tidy: anxiety → calm → acceptance lacks layered contradiction under peak stress. The final renunciation of control carries felt cost but borders on diagnostic clarity (“befriend uncertainty”) without deeper irrational resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in lineage, loss, and the weight of names, with interiority rendered through embodied regret and tactile memory. His micro-choices—etching symbols, rekindling furnaces—reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by failure. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“luminous regret,” “fractured purpose”) that borders on label-speak during peak beats, softening the raw contradiction expected under pressure. The redemption feels earned, but the internal struggle lacks simultaneous competing impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—rooted in his sister’s unresolved death—is embodied through micro-choices (using the bell, adjusting attunement) and contradicted by professional skepticism, lending depth without over-explanation. Thomas’s fear of forgetting laughter feels authentic, not sentimental. The luminous ache motif ties interiority to action. However, Elias’s “modest fearlessness” remains more label than lived tension under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kai’s trauma is embodied with visceral specificity—proprioceptive awareness, mask-triggered tremors, and breath-as-glass—but his epiphany (“mercy is a function of time over pain”) edges into diagnostic abstraction unearned by immediate action. His final choice (removing the strap) lacks a visible trade-off; the cost remains conceptual rather than physical or tactical. Contradictory impulses (rootedness vs. displacement) resonate but don’t collide in a decisive micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation—honoring overlooked histories—is credibly rooted in grandmother’s legacy and embodied through tactile interaction with the lens fragment. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception (“elusively tangible,” “warm in my pocket”). However, the final choice lacks visible cost beyond emotional resonance; no path is foreclosed, only affirmed. This limits the grade despite strong micro-choices and consistent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied through his profession and spectral perception, with contradictions (weightless burden vs. purpose) dramatized in action. His micro-choices—sampling dust, timing his visit, engaging spirits—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Motivation stems credibly from obsession and ability, intensifying to a final act of acceptance. The only slip: the horologist backstory risks over-explaining rather than emerging purely through present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eldon’s motivation—compressing eternity to reclaim a liquefied past—is consistent, embodied in ink-stained fingers and trembling hands, and intensifies credibly toward his climactic ritual. His internal contradiction (preservation vs. release) manifests in tactile choices: placing the vial beside the press, touching floating words. No secondary characters dilute focus; his solitude sharpens interiority. Final renunciation is earned: he accepts destruction as necessary for rebirth, with cost visible in cracking branches.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—reimagining civilization through poetic synthesis—is compelling and consistent, rooted in his identity as a “defunct revolutionary” who trades destruction for creation. His interiority is concrete (“burnished sorrow of lost causes”), and his micro-choices (draping mirrors, writing through the storm) reveal a hierarchy of values with clear cost: abandoning ideological purity for generative ambiguity. However, his transformation lacks embodied contradiction; he moves smoothly from despair to resolution without visible struggle or misstep, flattening emotional complexity. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible, but his solitary arc remains credible within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in personal loss and magical duty, and his actions align cohesively with his role as guardian of melody. His internal drive—reclaiming stolen light—is embodied through tactile work and emotional resonance rather than exposition. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or meaningful struggle (e.g., doubt, fatigue, moral ambiguity) prevents full 9+ status; he succeeds cleanly without visible friction between desire and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—longing for the boundary where explanation fails—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Her micro-choices (stepping into water, collecting lagoon water) reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are visceral (“primal,” “hinged awakening”) and tied to sensory detail. The final renunciation of mere collection for transformation feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent—her artistic drive and curiosity propel her actions—but interiority leans toward abstract self-awareness (“perpetually learning,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her epiphany feels earned by the vision, yet lacks struggle or flawed missteps; she moves smoothly from discovery to creation without resistance. The absence of a second character limits relational pressure, but within single-POV constraints, her choices align with her identity. However, emotional states remain declarative rather than viscerally rendered under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in generational curiosity and embodied through stained hands, trembling reach, and tactile engagement with postcards and glass. Her internal contradiction—between obsessive pursuit and quiet patience—manifests credibly in micro-choices (e.g., poring over texts at dawn, tracing etchings at night). The revelation feels earned because it emerges from sensory immersion, not abstract epiphany. However, her transformation leans slightly toward idealized clarity rather than flawed recalibration, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ellara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensations—teargas in her throat, trembling fingers—and her scholarly obsession feels authentic. Her motivation intensifies credibly from archival curiosity to personal reckoning. However, the transition from observer to active “time-traveler” lacks micro-choices that show struggle; her decision to parley feels more ordained than wrestled. The grandfather’s gaze across time is powerful but risks sentimentality without deeper contradiction in her response.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elior’s motivation is clear and consistent—his rejection of false comfort drives his refusal to rely on magical wishes—but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction. The epiphany about the amber bottle arrives cleanly, without struggle or misstep, leaning toward unearned clarity. His micro-choices (posting notices, sketching plans) align with motive, yet feel declarative rather than pressured. Final renunciation of passive hope is credible but not forged in visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and evolves credibly into prophetic duty, but his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension—his shift feels sequential rather than conflicted. The field trip memory functions more as exposition than a micro-choice altering present action. His final decision is earned, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than embodied in a tangible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Anya’s motivation—rooted in biological finitude and the hatched egg—is visceral, consistent, and intensifies her actions without diagnostic self-awareness. Her interior contradiction (“furious tranquility”) manifests physically and emotionally throughout, especially in her trembling hand at the climax. The final choice to touch rather than preserve reveals a reconfigured hierarchy of values with clear cost: she abandons her life’s archival impulse for direct experience. No stock phrasing; every emotion is embodied through frost, breath, seed placement.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in his credulous curiosity and devotion to listening over digital noise, compelling his high-stakes choice to trust the bell. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead revealing contradiction through tactile engagement (testing rope fibers, rerouting systems) and quiet endurance. The final smile carries earned stasis—his renunciation of modern validation in favor of mountain wisdom forecloses institutional acceptance but affirms his purpose. Flawlessly consistent, though slightly idealized without a tangible personal cost beyond solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elion’s motivation—seeking strength in vulnerability—is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving his climactic step into the void. His interiority is poetic but occasionally veers into diagnostic abstraction (“spiritually curious,” “flourishing stillness”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation feels earned through repeated empathic acts, though his emotional struggle lacks tangible friction or competing impulses in-scene. His choice to leave the station forecloses safety with implied cost, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recluse’s motivation—preserving unspoken words through silence—is embodied in every micro-choice, from rejecting speech to placing the box beneath the hive. Their internal contradiction (desire to understand ghosts vs. refusal to speak) manifests physically in tranquil stillness under pressure. The final renunciation of language is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: isolation, misunderstood visitors, and lifelong vigilance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in gesture and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand time’s texture—drives her actions with consistent interiority and embodied curiosity. Her micro-choices (decoding, embedding messages) reveal a hierarchy of values aligned with her role as timekeeper. However, internal contradiction is muted; she experiences awe and fear but without simultaneous conflicting impulses that complicate decisions. The urn fragment’s warmth at the end feels earned, yet emotional progression leans slightly tidy for peak-band complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The poet’s motivation is consistent and interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception (“caressing the thoughts into existence,” “colors shifted in the changing light”). However, her choices lack consequential friction—she observes and reflects but never confronts a meaningful dilemma that forces renunciation or trade-off. The child’s kite functions as metaphor, not pressure, so the poet’s arc remains contemplative rather than active. This limits character agency despite strong voice and emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation intensifies credibly from diagnosis to purpose, with micro-choices (e.g., handling copper wire despite arthritis) revealing values under pressure. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains embodied—“fingers trembling but precise” shows resolve without over-articulation. The final renunciation (accepting death after completing the circuit) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; calm dominates without internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradiction—his skepticism wars with yearning, and his academic rebellion manifests in tangible choices (e.g., ignoring the spiral detour). The fly amber pulses as both object and emotional conduit, grounding his epiphany in physical sensation. However, the final transformation from skeptic to believer leans slightly toward unearned certainty; the cost of relinquishing doubt is implied but not viscerally dramatized. His change feels resonant but lacks a concrete forfeiture that would cement Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s motivation—reclaiming a poisoned battlefield through ecological restoration—is vividly rooted in grief and linguistic erudition. His interiority is concrete (“narrow vastness,” belief in seeds as hope) and embodied through tactile handling of pods and bird-guided decisions. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves with unwavering resolve, missing internal friction that would deepen credibility. The final renunciation of anonymity is earned but costs feel abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas’s motivation—translating distance into closeness—is rooted in consistent traits (bloodhound perception, loyalty to Elara) and intensifies through micro-choices: studying grooves, departing at dawn, adjusting course. His interiority is concrete (“run his fingers over the waxy surface”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final reunion earns its emotional weight because his sensory expertise directly enables decoding the leaf-filtered messages. Flaws like solitude and sensory dormancy are overcome through struggle, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered with concrete sensory detail and emotional specificity, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation evolves credibly from survival to cartographer of hope, anchored in generational ritual. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—her isolation and duty feel sequential rather than coactive under pressure. The final renunciation (“true north had been within her”) is resonant but leans slightly toward epiphany without a preceding micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s chivalrous-thief duality and “sacredly playful” ethos drive concrete choices (stealing chess pieces, placing them deliberately), and his shift from proving worth to embracing the unknown feels earned. Interiority is vivid (“heart both racing and calm”) and embodied, though the master’s late arrival slightly softens Kael’s autonomy at the climax. The final micro-choice—pocketing the sundial with “wonder”—resonates with his core contradiction: reverence and mischief.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—benevolence tempered by ruthlessness, grief channeled into archival precision. Her motivation (preserving “small gestures”) stems credibly from trauma and profession, intensifying under pressure. The pawn’s appearance validates her method without resolving her burden, preserving cost. However, her emotional state occasionally drifts toward diagnostic self-awareness (“luminous absence,” “historian of small gestures”) that borders on label-speak, slightly flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maven’s motivation is clear and consistent—her search for “the shape of home” drives every action—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; instead, it unfolds as a series of realizations. Her emotional arc is embodied through tactile interactions (feather, stone, mercury glass), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation of physical place as home feels earned, though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. A stronger showing of simultaneous desire/fear during key choices would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with embodied guilt driving micro-choices (e.g., decoding threads as penance). His arc from arrogance to humility feels earned through decades of reflection tied to present action. The prince’s silent presence at the end crystallizes relational stakes without dialogue. However, the final reconciliation leans slightly toward unearned grace—his self-forgiveness arrives cleanly despite minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent: her defiance through poetry arises from a rejection of monolithic truth, rooted in her identity as an artist. Her internal conflict—between self-preservation and expression—is embodied in micro-choices (dawn sessions, final climb) and culminates in Earned Stasis. The “innocently mischievous” trait lacks concrete behavioral manifestation beyond label, slightly weakening interior contradiction. Final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost implied in ritual sacrifice stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcel’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling palm, weathered fingertips, and breath-holding ritual ground his emotional state in physicality. His motivation (to conjure meaning from oblivion) intensifies credibly through tactile engagement with the statue and charm. However, his epiphany about kintsugi arrives with slight diagnostic over-articulation (“repair them with precious gold… honest mending”), bordering on label-speak that risks unearned clarity. Still, his renunciation of erasure in favor of reparation feels earned by prior sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his aloofness, grief, and artistic devotion shape micro-choices like pocketing the shell or returning to paint with renewed purpose. His contradiction (longing for connection yet retreating into art) fuels credible emotional progression. The final act feels earned, not epiphanic, grounded in decades of quiet endurance. However, his reaction to the shell leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“temporary eternity”) rather than raw, destabilizing emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation is rooted in personal loss and intellectual curiosity, embodied through tactile actions (holding the vial, plucking jasmine) rather than abstract longing. His internal contradiction—gentle whisper vs. “screaming tenderness”—is dramatized coherently. Captain Morgan’s presence applies pressure without overshadowing Elias’s arc. The final tears feel earned, not sentimental, though the sister’s sudden recognition leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The navigator’s interiority is vividly embodied—scars, grafted skin, and haunted eyes render loss tactile. Motivation arises organically from personal history and present duty, not abstraction. Contradictory impulses (pride/sorrow, hope/grief) coexist credibly in key moments like the ship’s approach. Final renunciation of solitude for communal redemption feels earned, though slightly under-pressured by external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her rationality, trauma from involuntary truthfulness, and yearning for boundaries shape every micro-choice. The emotional progression feels embodied (e.g., voice cracking from disuse, tears upon speaking her own name). However, the final epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“transforming what had become a liability back into the gift it was meant to be”) rather than messy, character-specific realization, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meticulousness, isolation, and ritualistic habits shape his response to the stranger. His micro-choices (descending to investigate, mimicking the gesture) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over safety, connection over solitude. The borrowed memories create genuine internal conflict without therapy-speak. However, the final renunciation lacks visible cost beyond emotional resonance, slightly undercutting full Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his loneliness, empirical intuition, and deferred life choices manifest through embodied perception (“dust that coated his shelves was a testament to solitude”) and micro-choices (locking the shop without packing). His final decision feels earned, not epiphanic, with visible cost: the renunciation of passive solitude for active self-authorship. The mentor’s promise functions as motivation without over-explaining, and Elias’s contradiction—yearning for purpose yet entrenched in routine—is dramatized through action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotional progression avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied weariness and dream-haunted urgency, with credible contradictions between duty and longing. Her micro-choices—dismissing guards, donning climbing gear—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Maera functions effectively as a crucible, her presence deepening the queen’s resolve without overshadowing her agency. The final renunciation of disenchantment feels earned, though the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“true self, unburdened”) rather than messy self-reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s scientifically romantic interiority is vividly embodied, with contradictions between preservation and transformation animating her arc. Her micro-choices—selecting the gentlest technique, holding the nautilus shell—are grounded in consistent traits and carry visible cost. Leo functions effectively as a crucible, though his internal state remains opaque by design; their relationship shift is credibly earned through the secret’s exchange. The final renunciation of old methods feels inevitable yet costly, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly embodied—trembling fingers, feral nostalgia, envy of past selves—and his motivation to “distill chaos into narrative” drives consistent micro-choices. His contradictions (longing for ignorance while despising naivety) feel lived-in, not diagnostic. However, the epiphany at climax (“every grave was also a cradle”) borders on unearned abstraction despite strong buildup. The final pen-lift gesture concretizes his endurance but lacks a decisive cost beyond atmospheric resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her loss of smell refracted through tactile precision with water clocks and the birthing clamp screw. Her motivation shifts credibly from scent-based artistry to uncovering “ordinary miracles,” and her micro-choices (e.g., tracing the screw’s surface) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in connection. Lena’s anxiety and vulnerability feel authentic, though her emotional shift leans slightly tidy. The mutual recognition at the end earns its warmth without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s internal conflict—between fear of crystallization and determination to transform pain—is embodied through precise physical detail (trembling fingers, held breath) and micro-choices (sipping tea, whispering childhood words). Her flaw directly threatens her goal, and the resolution shows credible endurance with cost: she completes the rune but risks shattering. Motivation is rooted in consistent traits (scholarly discipline, trauma from past failure), though the final success leans slightly on ritual magic without deeper psychological reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eloise’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands, dust-streaked tears, and reliance on the perfume bottle reveal layered guilt and longing. Her motivation (apology) stems from a concrete past betrayal and drives every ritualistic choice. The micro-choice to remove her glasses to hide vulnerability sharpens emotional stakes. Beatrice’s presence functions as crucible, forcing Eloise to confront the jagged aftermath of her journalistic cruelty.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The witness’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to reconcile cosmic fragmentation. Their internal state evolves plausibly as their form solidifies through gathered truths. However, interiority remains abstract—emotions are conceptualized rather than embodied, lacking visceral contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final act feels inevitable but not wrestled from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arlo’s motivation—to understand what clocks truly measure—is consistent, embodied through tactile interactions with mechanisms, and culminates in a credible renunciation (vowing never to use the key conventionally). His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory perception (“razor edges refracting light,” “warm against his calloused palm”). The final choice—embracing backward-counting as revelation—feels earned by prior curiosity and micro-choices like inserting the key and observing reversed flow. However, the transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is compelling and embodied through her spatial awareness and micro-choices with the laser. Her internal contradiction (security vs. connection) drives credible escalation, though her emotional progression leans slightly tidy in the climax. The final near-touch crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost: relinquishing rigid boundaries for permeable trust. However, the epiphany borders on diagnostic (“mathematics of boundaries”) without deeper struggle or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her mathematical rigor versus emotional longing, her rejection of her father’s fatalism while inheriting his obsession with chance. Her micro-choices (copying the sequence, carrying the lantern) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over control, connection over certainty. The “theoretically rebellious” trait manifests in action, not label. However, the father exists only as memory; his absence limits relational crucible, capping full motivation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and particular, especially in his tactile relationship with the glass harmonica disc and his grief-tinged estrangement. His motivation—to teach endings how to begin—is unusual but consistent, rooted in loss and artistic silencing. The call with Meredith forces a micro-choice that shifts his stance from resistance to receptivity, with visible emotional cost. However, his transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient friction between contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archivist’s interiority is richly embodied—his trembling fingers, blurred vision, and ritualistic actions convey grief and devotion without diagnostic labels. His motivation (“preserve the weight of small moments”) emerges organically through tactile memory and micro-choices (mixing powders, timing the brush steep). Contradictory impulses—euphoria and sorrow, obsolescence and legacy—are woven into every gesture. The locket functions as both emotional anchor and narrative catalyst, grounding his final act in love rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Archie’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—his “desperately jocular” performance masking profound loneliness—and his micro-choices (e.g., clutching the briefcase, initiating the rumor) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The moon rock ruse emerges credibly from his childhood belief in reciprocity, and his final realization—that connection arises from sharing, not possessing—feels earned. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“the cure he’d sought wasn’t the rumor but the sharing of it”), bordering on label-speak without fully dramatizing the shift in action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elion’s motivation—navigating grief through cartography—is rooted in specific trauma and consistently drives his actions. His internal conflict between loss and discovery manifests through embodied perception (e.g., “quiet blaze of sensation beneath his fingertips”) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of external mapping for internal compass feels earned, with visible cost in his tears and transformed purpose. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward resolution without sufficient friction in the climax itself.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her “confidently uncertain” nature manifests in micro-choices (e.g., trusting the dried pen despite its mystery) and a guilt-to-determination arc that feels earned. Her flaw (misinterpreting the signal) directly motivates her present action, and her final renunciation of drastic time-bending in favor of gentle correction reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: living with partial fixes rather than clean erasures. The backstory block is anchored by the pen and spectral data, tilting her present stance without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied through gesture and perception, avoiding diagnostic labels. His motivation—rooted in maternal legacy and joyful sorrow—is consistent and compelling. However, his choices lack tangible friction or trade-offs; he maps silence without resistance or consequence, rendering his agency observational rather than decisive. The final renunciation (being forgotten) is poignant but untested by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, arsonist’s mind, and “volcanic tenderness” reflect a coherent, contradictory psyche. Her motivation (“I will protect the stories”) is rooted in childhood trauma and intensifies credibly through micro-choices (sketching, restoring). The restored portrait revealing her future self is earned by prior causality, with visible cost: years underground, enduring guilt. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s motivation is deeply rooted in her entangled grief and defiance, driving every action with emotional specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels—“occupational anxiety” is attributed to the doctor, not her—and her rebellion is embodied through drumming, not stated. The micro-choice to exploit system vulnerabilities via rhythm feels earned and consistent. Final renunciation isn’t of love but of separation, with cost implied in transience (“auroral sorrow”) and surveillance resumption.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlo’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his observational skill, reliance on maps, and quiet defiance feel embodied, not stated. His motivation (to prove whispers > shouts) emerges through action, not exposition. The zodiac coin and key function as extensions of his worldview, not props. However, his emotional state lacks contradiction; he’s calmly in control throughout, missing a moment of doubt or strain that would deepen credibility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The guardian’s interiority is conveyed through embodied calm and micro-choices (shutter adjustments, mirror angles), avoiding diagnostic labels. Their motivation—to teach darkness the value of stars—is consistent and shapes every action. The visitor’s presence introduces relational pressure without dialogue, yet the guardian’s silent empathy remains rooted in behavior, not abstraction. However, the visitor lacks individuation beyond “carrying a secret,” limiting the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arthur’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his empathic gift and pedagogical values. His internal conflict—between conformity and creative freedom—is embodied through concrete choices (recruiting co-conspirators, using the grotto) rather than abstract musing. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; he moves steadily from concern to action without hesitation or self-doubt that would deepen interiority. The absence of a meaningful flaw or blind spot weakens the credibility of his struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s internal conflict—between societal conformity and yearning for selfhood—is embodied with specificity (“calloused hands,” “combative tenderness”) and intensifies credibly toward her final choice. Her transformation feels earned through micro-choices: studying the scrimshaw, whispering dream-words, pressing it to her chest. However, the shift from emptiness to rebirth leans slightly on lyrical abstraction rather than granular struggle; a tighter link between her dock-worker identity and the island’s promise would deepen motivation. The ending renunciation carries felt cost (vanishing from known life), satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blank-faced performer’s internal contradiction—between enforced emptiness and cultivated emotional truth—is embodied through precise ritualistic actions. His motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in post-mandate grief, yet his theatrical narration occasionally veers into diagnostic self-awareness (“to cultivate lightness in grief”) that borders on label-speak. His renunciation of both sainthood and fraudulence reflects credible moral ambiguity, but the lack of active choice beyond performance limits escalation. The dried flowers and whittling figures serve as externalizations of interiority, though the character remains more symbol than fully individuated person.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The poet’s motivation is clear and rooted in their identity as a cloud-shadow artist, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Emotions are described (“heart pounding,” “tremor of certainty”) without visceral, character-specific physicality or irrational contradiction. The transformation feels earned thematically but lacks micro-choices under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Final endurance reads as conceptual rather than dramatized through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—to restore not color but the capacity to see beauty in imperfection—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits and intensifies credibly through her plant arrangements and trade of the reed tongue. Her “innocently cunning” nature manifests in micro-choices (e.g., protecting her patterns, selecting Fibonacci sequencing) that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: weeks of labor for another’s healing. The return of her color vision is understated, avoiding epiphany cliché, and her final smile integrates old and new perception without sentimentality. Master Gideon’s parallel arc feels earned through shared thematic pressure rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism-song bell ringer’s motivation is consistent and embodied through tactile interaction with artifacts, especially the carbide lens. Her interiority avoids diagnostic phrasing and remains rooted in sensory experience. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses—she moves steadily toward revelation without resistance or internal friction. This smooth progression undercuts the "powerfully gentle" trait’s potential for tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests through halted hands, then reverent motion—and her motivation evolves credibly from personal loss to compassionate service. The phoenix stencil anchors her emotional arc without over-explanation. However, her transformation leans slightly on lyrical assertion (“learned to bloom again”) rather than dramatized struggle, softening the cost. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant; single-POV execution is strong but stops short of 9+ due to minor epiphanic summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to map cultural patterns through cartomancy—is compelling and consistent, rooted in familial legacy and societal collapse. His micro-choice to confide in the visitor reveals a hierarchy of values: truth over secrecy, collaboration over isolation. The visitor’s mirrored curiosity creates a credible kinship without over-explaining interiority. However, emotional embodiment remains slightly abstract (“steadily curious intensity”) rather than viscerally contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her “anguished joy” and struggle with pattern-avoidance feel authentic and contradictory. Her motivation is consistent, and her final merging with the archive reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis). However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward summary in key moments (“felt their hopes, their fears”) rather than fully dramatized sensation, preventing a 9+. The cost of her transformation is clear but not viscerally rendered in micro-behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—“to preserve the shape of hope”—is embodied through micro-choices (sketching shadows, clutching the river stone) and evolves credibly into a personal mission after recognizing her lost friend. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are tactile (“breath catch,” “fingers tightened”) and contradictory (duty vs. grief). The final renunciation—accepting that the shadow sought reunion, not documentation—carries luminous regret as felt cost. Flawlessly rendered within single-POV constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, especially in her tactile interactions with the chameleon and reflections on betrayal. However, her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“reconstruct my understanding,” “shed layers of blindness”) that borders on therapy-speak without sufficient dramatized struggle to fully earn the insight. Her motivation is clear and consistent, but the absence of another on-page character limits relational pressure, reducing opportunities for contradictory impulses to manifest in action rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation as a “closure seeker who opens wounds” is embodied through micro-choices—examining coffee rings, pressing stone scars—and her telepathy with plants reveals interior contradiction between excavation and integration. Her epiphany feels earned, not diagnostic, though the transition from confusion to full temporal comprehension leans slightly swift. The cost of renouncing her old method is legible in her changed relationship to scars and the empty hourglass. Flaw: near-perfect emotional calibration at climax slightly undercuts struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s motivation—to locate “unused love”—is vividly rendered and tied to her own emotional history, grounding her psychometric ritual in personal need. Her spatial imagination and sensory perception feel specific and embodied, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she moves steadily toward revelation without resistance or hesitation, flattening emotional tension. The tear on her cheek is poignant but unearned by prior struggle—more epiphany than crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her affliction of hearing unspoken words is embodied through sensory overload and creative paralysis. Her micro-choices (lifting the instrument, tracing star paths) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over silence, distillation over escape. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the shift from cacophony to harmony occurs with minimal friction, softening the cost of her breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The freight guard’s motivation—to cultivate sparks in unlit corners—is consistent and emotionally grounded, revealed through micro-choices like placing the chess clock on the podium. His internal contradiction (dreamless yet remembering futures) is embodied rather than labeled, and his transformation from detached observer to someone who “perhaps” dreams feels earned. However, his emotional shift lacks a clear friction point where cost is actively borne; the change leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle. The Archivist functions as foil but exerts minimal pressure, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile interactions with the gear and forest, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His internal contradiction—between restless seeking and emergent acceptance—is shown via micro-choices (e.g., placing the gear in the notch). The flaw lies in slightly over-articulated epiphanies (“probable miracles,” “infinite landscape within”) that verge on unearned abstraction despite strong grounding elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maris’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her weathered palm, the heating ticket punch—but her internal contradiction lacks friction; courage is sought without visible resistance or competing impulse. The dragons’ arrival feels earned by ritual, not struggle. Secondary guides are atmospheric, not pressurizing. Final renunciation (“we become the ferry guides of courage”) crystallizes a stance but with minimal personal cost shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bellhop’s internal conflict—between healing and surrender, silence and song—is rendered through embodied sensation (numb hands, phantom tingles) and micro-choices (crouching, tracing, pulling the bolt). His motivation intensifies organically from passive recovery to active reclamation, culminating in a choice that forecloses sanctuary for uncertain redemption. The final act of singing feels earned by his gradual re-engagement with memory and melody. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile detail and constrained agency.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—her regal bearing versus diminutive stature, her burdened eyes versus steady hands. Her arc from seeking external validation to internal clarity feels earned, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses the throne with palpable cost. However, the final self-revelation leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“unmasked herself”) rather than fully dramatized realization, nudging it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motivation is rooted in childhood trauma and sustained by professional duty, with embodied gestures like rhythmic tapping revealing inner tension. Her emotional arc—from grief to witnessing rebirth—is earned through specific memories and present actions. However, her final realization leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“Earth slowly returning to a pre-industrial state”) that borders on label-speak, though it’s mitigated by immediate tactile grounding (folding the atlas). The contradiction between drifting and moored is felt but not fully dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stargazer’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied sensation and inherited longing, yet her transformation lacks micro-choices under pressure—her epiphany arrives as revelation rather than earned struggle. The “awkwardly confident” trait is stated but never tested or shown to incur cost. Her motivation to “discover meaning in the mess” remains abstract until the stones impose meaning upon her, reversing agency. Final stance feels imposed by setting, not wrested from internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation—evolving tradition through lived experience—is credibly rooted in her history as an insurgent grandmother, and her internal conflict between skepticism and revelation feels embodied rather than abstract. Her telepathic connection with plants emerges as a character-specific trait that guides choices, not a deus ex machina. However, the transition from dismissive rebel to destiny-accepting seer leans slightly on epiphanic convenience; the “implanted destiny” concept risks over-rationalizing her arc. Still, her final choice to embrace the embryo as evolutionary catalyst feels earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her somatic markers, scarred hands, and ritual with the photograph reveal trauma without therapy-speak. Her contradictory impulses (holding onto joy while releasing pain) act simultaneously in the climax. The final release of the photo is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for slightly idealized emotional calibration under extreme stress.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her smudged charcoal, stained fingers, and “luminescent ache” convey emotional states without diagnostic label-speak. Her motivation (to recover artistic spark) intensifies credibly through tactile engagement with the tarot box and threads. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the shift from despair to steady-handed creation lacks friction or visible cost beyond abstract “ache.” The final choice feels earned but minimally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The albino tracker’s motivation is rooted in a compelling personal history and embodied through specific sensory perception (albinism as perceptual lens). Their “serene anger” and “consciously wild” nature manifest in micro-choices like commanding the drone and stepping into the ink. However, the epiphany—“We change our relationship to it during moments of crisis”—edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient dramatized struggle preceding it. The cost of their temporal displacement is felt (vitals fluctuate), but the emotional arc leans slightly tidy for the high-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through embodied reactions (“automated breath stabilizers struggled,” “heart raced”) and a clear hierarchy of values that culminates in her renunciation of duty. However, the phrase “bravely conflicted” appears as a diagnostic label rather than dramatized contradiction, slightly flattening emotional authenticity at peak pressure. Her transformation from preserver to liberator feels earned by prior stakes, though the moral calculus leans toward idealized clarity over messy self-deception. The final choice carries visible cost—cryonic suspension or worse—but the absence of tangible hesitation weakens the full weight of betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rhiannon’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “senseless perception” manifests in concrete botanical attentiveness, not diagnostic labels. Her renunciation of her father’s hunter legacy is credible and charged with quiet cost, crystallized in her repurposing of the sandbag scrap. However, her internal conflict remains implied rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses; we see her choice, not the struggle beneath it. The final act of sheathing shears reads as Earned Stasis but lacks a visible sacrifice beyond generalized world-weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fisher’s motivation is consistent and embodied through his actions, especially his calm precision during high-stakes weaving. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead expressing emotion through tactile detail (e.g., the rail spike’s “familiar and comforting” weight). However, his emotional contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene—cool-headedness never visibly contends with doubt or fear under pressure. This lack of simultaneous internal conflict prevents full 9+ eligibility despite strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and rooted in familial legacy, with micro-choices (e.g., choosing proof by contradiction) revealing her values. However, internal conflict remains intellectual rather than emotionally embodied—regret is named but not viscerally felt in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her competence borders on effortless, lacking genuine struggle that would deepen credibility. The final renunciation of accusation in favor of logic feels earned but carries minimal visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s guilt is embodied with visceral specificity—his deafness, tattooing, and firmware work all refract his trauma without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to initiate the tether sequence reveals a hierarchy of values: confronting grief over preserving silence. The final act of inking musical notes shows credible endurance with visible cost—permanent skin as archive of loss and relief. Contradictory impulses (to silence vs. hear) collide in-scene and resolve through earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s socially perceptive trait and whimsical artistry cohere consistently, driving his nonverbal interjection through the mandala. His interiority—lilac unease, reverence for impermanence—is embodied and particular, not diagnostic. The choice to disassemble the mandala enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: relinquishing permanence to honor the unlearning. However, secondary characters lack individuation; their transformation feels collective rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”—is vividly embodied through his ritualistic act and consistent interiority. His retrocognitive trait shapes perception without lapsing into diagnostic label-speak, and his final choice to “rename” is earned by prior causality. However, internal contradiction remains muted; his resolve never truly wavers under pressure, softening the cost of his endurance. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible but doesn’t harm single-POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—saving the garden to preserve his last mortal connection—is consistent, emotionally grounded, and intensifies as stakes rise. His synesthetic perception and ghostly limitations shape credible choices (e.g., singing to weave time). Interiority is vividly embodied (“petals tasting like laughter”), though emotional progression leans slightly tidy in its arc from nostalgia to peace. Final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost: dissolution into mist after pouring his essence into the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s affectionate skepticism is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—her pulse syncing with the geode while her mind resists belief—but her transformation into “a believer” leans on abstract phrasing (“extraordinary potential of the human spirit”) rather than earned micro-choices. The brother’s off-page presence limits relational crucible depth, though her motivation remains consistent and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her sensory sensitivity drives her into the caves—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene. She experiences awe and purpose, not tension between competing desires. The fossil’s “choice” of her risks feeling fated rather than earned through struggle, though her early awakening and unique skill ground her role credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—transforming fate into possibility—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene. Emotions are embodied (“amber light,” “quietly inspired”) yet verge on diagnostic abstraction (“profound connection,” “crystallized”). Her micro-choices (cataloging buttons) reveal values, but the absence of struggle or error flattens her arc. The final renunciation of solitude is earned, though the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aleksandr’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensation (“fingers he no longer fully trusted,” “storm within him raged”) and micro-choices (carving snow codes, handling the pillbox). His contradictory impulses—between paralysis and purpose, secrecy and truth—are active in-scene, not summarized. The final decision to reclaim rather than repair feels earned by his accumulated gestures. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic articulation (“fractures as maps rather than failures”), risking over-clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coachman’s motivation—distilling complexity into essence through stitching—is consistent and embodied, yet his internal conflict remains abstract rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His micro-choices (e.g., timing stitches to rain gutters) reveal hierarchy of values, but emotional embodiment leans on lyrical phrasing over visceral sensation. The final renunciation lacks a foreclosed path with tangible cost; endurance is serene but untested. Interiority is poetic yet risks diagnostic label-speak (“spindrift serenity”) without grounding contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his “sharp gentleness” manifests in micro-choices like brushing the lantern glass or working the earth with potter’s tools. His motivation to understand resistance to decay drives every action, and his epiphany feels earned through tactile engagement, not abstraction. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; he moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding without palpable struggle or doubt. The final renunciation—choosing to return with others—is credible but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in inherited legacy and urban isolation—feels consistent and embodied, especially through tactile interactions with the bitting gauge tooth and seed pods. Her internal contradiction (pragmatism vs. yearning for luminous purpose) manifests in micro-choices: packing specific tools, rowing to a hidden alcove. The elderly man’s appearance risks convenience, but his connection to her grandmother retroactively justifies emotional resonance without undermining causality. However, Mara’s transformation leans slightly on epiphany rather than struggle, softening the cost of her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motivation—to translate isolation into independence—is vividly embodied through micro-choices like touching the Oracular Mirror and placing her hand on the reflective wall. Her internal conflict between ancestral legacy and emergent self feels specific and textured, though the epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“golden light of acceptance”) rather than fully earned irrationality. The brittle awakenings effectively convey vulnerability without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of control in favor of coexistence is credibly rooted in prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her whimsical perception and professional exhaustion, but her transformation leans slightly on diagnostic self-awareness (“keeper of secrets,” “inevitably whimsical”) rather than fully embodied contradiction. Her final choice—to write for herself—feels earned, yet the emotional cost of abandoning ghostwriting remains abstract. The thrush’s nest triggers recognition, but the shift lacks a micro-choice under pressure that visibly forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her obsession with decoding the tricksters’ signals drives her actions—but her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she shifts from caution to action without visible competing impulses in-scene. Her “cautiously hopeful” trait is named but not dramatized as a constraint during the climax. The final choice feels earned, yet emotional embodiment leans on familiar tropes (“hairs on arms stand at attention”) rather than idiosyncratic physicality. Still, her flawed isolation and scholarly rigor ground her as an individual, not a trope.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” nature are embodied through physical discomfort and risk-assessment, not just stated. Her motivation—freedom for her people—is consistent and intensifies under pressure. However, the internal contradiction between fear and rebellion resolves too cleanly at the climax without lingering cost or struggle, slightly undermining earned transformation. The final choice feels resonant but lacks a visible sacrifice beyond stepping forward.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s face-blindness is embodied through tactile perception and professional method, not just stated. Her motivation—to awaken empathy—is compelling but borders on abstract; it lacks friction with a competing want or fear in-scene. The assistant as killer emerges logically from her process, yet the final realization feels slightly diagnostic (“slight body frame... matching struggle patterns”) rather than earned through prior physical or emotional struggle. Interiority remains consistent, though the confession at dawn arrives off-page, softening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s motivation—rooted in ancestral legacy and scientific obsession—is compellingly embodied through the copper nail and decoding work. Their “nervously confident” trait manifests in trembling fingers and intuitive leaps, creating authentic internal tension. However, Dr. Aris remains underdeveloped; her shift from skepticism to fascination occurs off-page, weakening relational pressure. The final choice feels earned but leans slightly on inherited destiny over active moral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—sculpting possibility from the ashes of “never”—is credibly rooted in his brother’s rejection and crystallizes through micro-choices (picking up the flake, recounting aloud). His dynamically observant nature manifests concretely in sensory cataloguing, not just label. However, the emotional shift from disbelief to resolve leans slightly on declarative insight (“he understood his motivation”) rather than fully embodied struggle, softening the cost. Interior contradiction is present but streamlined for lyric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his "perceptively calm" demeanor contrasts with his father’s volatility, and his micro-choices (studying currencies, refusing Marcus’s pressure) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in legacy redefinition. His motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, and his endurance at closure constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost: the loss of his company but preservation of dignity. However, the internal conflict leans slightly toward summarized contradiction (“build rather than take”) rather than simultaneous opposing impulses in-scene, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as a lucid dream chronicler with a healing gift, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her struggle feels more intellectual than visceral. Dr. Thorne functions well as a secondary pressure source, yet their relationship crystallizes too smoothly without friction or status shift. The final choice to share the burden is earned, though the cost remains abstract rather than physically or emotionally specific. Interiority leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“healing wisdom lost to humanity”) rather than sensory immediacy under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The druid’s motivation—freeing her mentor—is clear and intensifies through embodied choices (e.g., drawing blood to feed the seed). Her “warlike serenity” manifests as consistent emotional control under pressure, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; her struggle feels competent but lacks a palpable blind spot or self-deception that would deepen the final renunciation. The mentor’s late appearance limits relational crucible development.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The visionary’s internal conflict—between confinement and curiosity—is clear, but their emotional arc leans on abstract labels (“anxious elation,” “purposefully curious”) rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation is consistent but lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final realization feels earned thematically but not through specific, flawed struggle; epiphany arrives with minimal friction. Flaws are stated more than dramatized, reducing the cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “fierce gentleness,” recklessness, and sacrificial resolve cohere into a singular psyche under pressure. Her micro-choices (tracing roots, placing the card, raising hands to trammel) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: her bartered destiny. However, her internal contradiction (“reckless idealist” vs. learned patience) remains slightly abstracted rather than enacted in simultaneous impulses during the climax, costing full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his grief, professional shame, and tactile reverence for the cloth feel authentic and specific. His “confidently uncertain” appraisal method reveals a hard-won epistemology shaped by loss. The micro-choice to authenticate despite knowing the scrap’s market worthlessness demonstrates a renunciation of external validation in favor of personal meaning. However, his emotional shift leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“glimmer of passion”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “kindly methodical precision” contrasts with predecessors’ “haunted ambitions,” grounding her motivation in embodied caution. The seed’s vibration as a “second heartbeat” reveals emotional stakes without therapy-speak. Her final choice to board the vessel feels earned through analogical reasoning, not ambition. However, internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in-scene, slightly softening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s interiority is richly embodied through ritual and lunar identity shifts, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Contradictory impulses—preservation vs. transformation, archivist vs. weaver—are active in scene, not summarized. The final synthesis feels earned through acceptance rather than resolution, with visible cost in the loss of fixed identity. However, the character’s emotional arc leans slightly abstract in its lyrical framing, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inspector’s motivation crystallizes credibly from discovery to mission, with embodied emotion (“trembling fingers,” “warmth spread like liquid sunlight”) and a clear hierarchy of values revealed in her choice to lift the pearl. Her transformation avoids diagnostic self-awareness, staying grounded in sensory experience. However, the shift from passive observer to active healer lacks intermediate micro-choices that dramatize internal contradiction—her epiphany arrives as revelation rather than struggle. This near-flawless interior arc earns high marks but falls just short of 9+ due to missing friction in the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, guilt, and methodical nature interweave without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (transcribing graffiti, descending into tunnels) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The brother’s accordion and the river map her emotional terrain credibly. Final renunciation of denial feels earned through prior causality and sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is vivid and embodied, especially in their tactile interactions with the watch and journal. Their motivation—to recover unspoken words—feels deeply personal and consistent. However, the character’s transformation leans slightly toward epiphany rather than struggle; the final realization arrives with elegance but minimal friction. Still, their micro-choices (e.g., transcribing under deadline) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving a fragile cultural dream against imperial erasure—is rooted in consistent traits (provenance researcher, plant telepathy) and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict (duty vs. preservation) manifests through embodied choices: reading coffee grounds, playing the violin, directing crystalline pollen. The final act of propagation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the inert original, the empire’s hollow trophy. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are rendered through sensory specificity (“mulberry ache,” “psychic pricks”).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in the loss of her sister—is vividly embodied and drives every action, especially her tactile, reverent handling of the body and emerald chip. Her internal contradiction (preserving memory vs. accepting death) manifests through micro-choices like whispering specific memories aloud, which feels authentic rather than diagnostic. However, her emotional state remains slightly idealized; there’s minimal degradation under stress or irrationality that would deepen credibility. The final renunciation—accepting preservation as redemption—is earned and carries visible cost: she continues alone, surrounded by vials of lost sparks.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradiction—her “kindly decisive” nature warring with unresolved grief—but her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“destruction was merely preparation for rebirth”) that borders on unearned abstraction. The hairpin and scallop motifs ground her emotional arc, yet the betrayal backstory remains summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Her final transformation feels earned by ritual repetition, though the cost of forgiveness lacks visceral specificity beyond lost scrolls.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—his “sincerely insincere” demeanor, the weight of the mirror shard, and his professional detachment masking vulnerability. His micro-choices (selecting chimes, interpreting their sequence) reveal a hierarchy of values that prioritize nuance over judgment. The fisherman functions effectively as secondary pressure, though his transformation leans slightly toward summary. Elian’s final moment of exposed vulnerability feels earned by prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s internal shift from confusion to comprehension is embodied through micro-choices (precise stone toss, brow furrowing, demand to “show me”) that feel earned. Elien’s paradoxical aging and withheld knowledge create layered motivation, though his interiority remains slightly abstract. The cost—Elien losing a decade—is resonant but arrives abruptly without prior physical or emotional foreshadowing of personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—centuries-long devotion to “navigating without moving”—is consistent and rooted in his identity as a harmonic stone skimmer, but his interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. His emotional arc culminates credibly in Earned Stasis, yet key choices (e.g., following crows) lack tangible friction or trade-offs that would ground his transformation in visceral struggle. The final renunciation feels resonant but slightly unearned due to minimal on-page resistance or flawed missteps. Still, his reverence for history and tactile connection to artifacts lend him specificity beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—to find the sacred in the simple—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., unstrapping his Regulation Pack), not abstract longing. His internal conflict between systemic conformity and authentic magic manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic self-awareness. The transformation feels earned, though the lack of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible depth. Final renunciation of standardized magic carries visible cost: loss of institutional belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hemingway’s synesthetic perception grounds his motivation in a vivid, character-specific trait, and his choice to accept the librarian’s charge feels earned. His interiority is concrete (“harbor waves are indigo”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. However, the final vow lacks a visible personal cost—his transformation is seamless, missing a moment of struggle or sacrifice that would elevate this to 9+. The key dissolving into his skin symbolizes integration but not loss.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Loran’s motivation is consistent and his quiet enthusiasm credibly sustains him, but his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his certainty never truly wavers under pressure. The trait “quietly enthusiastic” functions more as label than lived tension, especially during the climactic coin toss. His final choice feels earned by ritual rather than personal struggle, reducing emotional cost. Korin’s presence adds external doubt but doesn’t force Loran into a meaningful interpersonal crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The reaper’s interiority is richly embodied—tears staining his cloak, voice like “dry leaves,” tracing tentacles with a bony finger—and his motivation (naming fears to heal heartbreak) intensifies credibly. His micro-choices (naming Solitude, Lost Hope, Elara’s Eyes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. However, the epiphany feels slightly too tidy; the transition from despair to purpose lacks friction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in-scene. The final release verges on diagnostic (“crystallized through scattered light”) without sufficient struggle preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mage’s earnest naivety and lukewarm powers are embodied through consistent micro-choices—kneeling, tracing the bell, obsessing over drip rates—that reveal a hierarchy of values (devotion over efficacy). His internal contradiction—believing he can mend the impossible despite knowing his limits—is dramatized, not summarized. The emotional arc feels earned: his quiet smile at the end reflects a shift in self-perception, not a sudden power upgrade. No diagnostic label-speak; feelings emerge through tactile engagement with water, bronze, and light.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thomas’s motivation is rooted in a deeply personal, gradually revealed connection to the submerged town, and his interiority avoids diagnostic labels. His micro-choices—examining the label, searching journals, making calls—are consistent with his “precisely humane” ethos. The recognition of his aunt delivers emotional weight without sentimentality. However, the internal contradiction between duty and truth feels slightly under-pressured until the climax, limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—analytical yet sentimental—is credibly embodied through her hidden box of failed tokens and her dual perception of the starlings’ patterns. However, her final transformation lacks a tangible cost or trade-off; the “perfect balance” arrives without friction or sacrifice, undercutting emotional credibility. The mentor memory is poignant but functions as ornament rather than pressure. Motivation is clear but culminates in an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pattern seeker’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied actions—fingers flying across the keypad, instinctive tether grabs—but internal contradiction remains underdeveloped. Motivation (“preserve trust”) is consistent yet abstract; the character’s emotional arc lacks a visible renunciation or decisive turn that forecloses a path with tangible cost. Muscle memory and inventive attention are traits enacted, not merely labeled, yet their interplay doesn’t generate authentic tension between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s emotional numbness and internal contradiction—between avoidance and the need to feel—are embodied through tactile actions (tracing glass, channeling vitality) rather than diagnostic labels. Her final choice to embrace pain is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the loss of protective detachment. However, the transition from hollow survivor to “vivifier” leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-beats showing struggle mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a creator resisting commodification. However, her interiority leans on abstract phrasing (“hush of possibility,” “orthogonal approaches”) rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. The final choice—planting the seed—is resonant but lacks a visible cost or trade-off that would ground her commitment. Her “notably receptive mind” functions more as label than lived trait under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motivation—restoring lost laughter—is embodied through tactile ritual and modulated action, not abstract longing. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels; grief manifests via the blower’s throttle control and swaying posture. The “mournfully eager” ache drives micro-choices (e.g., partial throttle, directional aim) that reveal his hierarchy of values: resonance over resolution. However, the infantile giggle risks feeling unearned, slightly undercutting the causal chain of his endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The guardian’s motivation—to befriend uncertainty—is embodied through centuries of disciplined waiting and the active practice of “interiorizing exteriors,” which culminates in a credible, earned transformation. Their dimensionally homesick longing is rendered with concrete sensory detail rather than abstraction. However, the final shift into translucence leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choice buildup under peak pressure. The character remains compellingly feral yet introspective, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered—his stoic sensitivity, despair, and hope coexist in embodied detail (“feeling every crack in the cobblestones,” “voice cracking with emotion”). His motivation—to transform rather than restore—is consistent and intensifies through successive attempts. The final choice feels earned, with visible cost (abandoning ancestral preservation). However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy; the shift from “hopeless” to triumphant lacks a moment of authentic doubt that would heighten credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her philosophy of finding beginnings in endings, which directly fuels her actions. Her interiority is concrete—embodied through tactile interactions with the fragment, the shard of hush, and the wind—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her struggle is externalized rather than internalized. The absence of true internal conflict or flawed missteps makes her competence feel unearned, reducing emotional stakes. Still, her micro-choices (placing the shard, discarding assumptions) reveal values with subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Liam’s motivation—rooted in a childhood accident fracturing his existence across timelines—is vividly embodied through the empty hourglass and tactile interactions with the ferry’s console. His “resiliently positive” demeanor reads as earned defiance, not sentimentality, especially when contrasted with crew anxiety. The final choice to merge timelines forecloses his prior state of fragmentation with visible emotional cost. However, interior contradiction is underexplored; his optimism lacks simultaneous doubt or fear that would deepen psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation—reconnection with his sister—is clear, deeply personal, and intensifies organically. His interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through tactile engagement with sinew thread and the gallery’s shifting walls. The final choice to reach out is earned by prior causality, with the cost being years of longing transformed into active connection. However, his internal contradiction (comfort vs. disturbance, logic vs. longing) remains slightly abstract rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kael’s motivation—rooted in his “balancedly curious” nature and isolation after alien contact—is consistent and compelling, driving his development of edge geometry. His interiority is concrete (e.g., tracing refracted radiation while holding the chain link), though the trait “balancedly curious” leans slightly toward label-speak without sufficient contradictory impulses in-scene. The final choice to pioneer a new navigation method feels earned, with cost implied through years of solitude and skepticism. However, emotional complexity remains restrained rather than layered, limiting full character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s motivation—rooted in grief and curiosity—is consistent and intensifies under pressure, driving her to act decisively. Her interiority is concrete (“sensitive fingers,” “persistently curious mind”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The child’s presence forces a micro-choice (approach slowly) that reveals Elena’s protective hierarchy of values. However, the grandmother’s emotional residue borders on convenient omniscience, slightly undermining struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s claustrophobia, grief for her brother, and devotion to the unremembered form a tightly braided interiority that drives every micro-choice. Her motivation is consistent and embodied—e.g., steadying breath despite walls “pressing closer”—and culminates in Earned Stasis: enduring isolation to fulfill her duty. The flaw (claustrophobia) directly complicates her mission yet is overcome through purpose, not erased. However, the brother/Thorne parallel leans slightly on exposition rather than dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile rituals (porcelain shard, heartbeat counting) and emotionally specific contradictions—yearning for return yet finding solace in liminality. Motivation (“fetch wisdom from failure”) intensifies credibly into a thematic renunciation rather than resolution. The flaw of diagnostic self-awareness (“death certificate error survivor”) is offset by consistent sensory grounding. Final endurance—choosing connection over reintegration—is earned through defragmentation as micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storyteller’s motivation is vividly embodied—his copper veins, tactile reading of fabrics, and decades-long ritual make his drive visceral. His interiority avoids abstraction; emotion emerges through action (tracing birds, weeping at the diamond’s hum). The final laugh-and-tears moment crystallizes a lifetime of quiet endurance with visible cost: aging, isolation, irreplaceable loss. No head-hopping or diagnostic label-speak mars this single-POV execution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation shifts credibly from academic bitterness to protective wonder, embodied through tactile interactions with the arrowhead and cryptids. Their internal contradiction—between documenting truth and fearing disbelief—is consistent and deepens organically. The transformation feels earned, not epiphanic, though the emotional cost of their renunciation (choosing witness over proof) remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elayn’s motivation is vividly rooted in her desire to reawaken beauty, and her micro-choices—like using heart rhythms to pacify statues—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her emotional state remains largely unconflicted despite high stakes. The locust shell’s resonance feels more symbolic than psychologically embodied, limiting interior depth. Her transformation lacks a visible cost beyond effort, weakening the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is consistent and embodied—his “respectfully rebellious” ethos manifests in micro-choices (e.g., brushing hands with the contact, feigning routine deliveries). Interiority avoids therapy-speak; emotions are shown through physical detail (“adrenaline flooding his veins,” “weathered face”). The woman’s trembling hands and whispered hope deepen relational stakes without melodrama. However, her interior remains slightly underdeveloped beyond maternal longing, preventing full 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The carpenter’s motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—is compellingly embodied through tactile work and culminates in the earned choice to sing. Their internal conflict (fear vs. desire) manifests physically and emotionally without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of silence carries visible cost: decades of muteness broken, yet no words follow—only song, reconfiguring identity. However, the character’s backstory is slightly over-explained early, reducing mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “sanely eccentric” devotion, tactile rituals, and emotional contradictions feel specific and lived-in. Her motivation (to reawaken dormant stories) intensifies credibly through micro-choices: arranging books, whispering dual-language verses, extending her hand into the hyperbolic core. The scarf’s dissolution and her tears mark a resonant renunciation with felt cost. However, her epiphany (“The place where stories live isn't a location…”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—grief-driven pursuit of her sister through art—is vividly embodied and consistent. Her micro-choices (dawn photography, palette use, deciphering symbols) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on connection over closure. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotion manifests through tactile ritual and luminous absence. The final realization feels earned, not epiphanic, with the cost of years spent chasing a presence she now learns to acknowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied ritual and professional specificity, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. His motivation—to liberate trapped human potential—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices (e.g., pressing hair to forehead, circling the nexus). The woman’s consciousness is shown, not told, trembling at her own threshold. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous impulses; she shifts cleanly from fear to liberation without struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, tactile engagement with mushrooms, and visceral memory flashes reveal contradiction between skepticism and longing. Her “chronically curious” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., daily returns, sketching constellations) that escalate stakes. The final reclamation feels earned through decades of consistent behavior, not epiphany. However, her emotional shift from fear to eagerness lacks a mid-point friction beat that would clinch 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, backward pacing, and “combative tenderness” reveal contradiction without therapy-speak. Prisha’s arc from nervousness to grounded resilience feels earned through micro-choices (spilling leaves, not retreating at the door). Motivation stems from consistent traits: his exile informs his mentorship, and his craft defines his worldview. However, the archivist’s backstory remains abstracted rather than dramatized, slightly weakening causal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pruner’s motivation—to preserve “the color of wonder”—is consistent and emotionally resonant, rooted in memory and craft. Her insatiable creativity drives her actions, yet internal contradiction is minimal; she acts with near-perfect clarity, lacking struggle or doubt that would deepen interiority. The final renunciation (“one must sometimes give pieces of oneself”) feels earned but lacks a dramatized moment of sacrifice—cost is stated, not embodied. Still, micro-choices (pressing the seed, weaving light) reveal values with quiet specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s internal contradiction—her brokenness enabling her to heal others—is embodied through trembling hands and accumulated silence, not stated abstractly. Her micro-choice to wield the needle despite fear reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Jacob’s weathered presence applies immediate pressure without overshadowing Elena’s agency. The final shift in her self-perception feels earned, not epiphanic, grounded in the physical act of unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is deeply rooted in her methodical curiosity and drives every action. Her interiority is concrete (“trembling hands,” “profound sense of shielded openness”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. The final choice to repair the map as a threshold, not a barrier, is earned through prior micro-choices (overlaying footage, aligning constellations) and carries conceptual cost: she forgoes documentation for experiential reverence. No secondary characters dilute focus; her solitary arc crystallizes under pressure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her “first name basis with death” informs her quiet analyticity and grief-driven mission. Her epiphany about “home” as a state of being, not place, emerges credibly from tactile observation and emotional buildup. The final micro-choice—to share her findings—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of personal vulnerability. However, her internal contradiction (desire to solve vs. fear of confronting loss) is implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in childhood silence and empathy for the inarticulate—is compelling and consistent, driving her actions with emotional logic. Her interiority is rendered through poetic perception rather than diagnostic labels, though it leans toward abstraction over embodied contradiction. The final renunciation (singing only for the ghost) forecloses human connection with quiet cost, yet lacks a micro-choice under pressure that would elevate it to 9+. Her drifting alertness remains a stated trait rather than a source of tangible struggle or error.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elira’s interiority is vivid and consistent, grounded in embodied perception (“leather straps cold against her skin”) and micro-choices (decryption attempt, returning the diary). Her warmly inquisitive nature drives action, not just observation. The final renunciation—preserving the captain’s secret—is earned through accumulated empathy. However, the captain remains a construct of memory; his emotional duality lacks on-page friction or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s motivation—proving atmospheric memory to honor her mentor—is compelling and consistent, driving her actions with emotional specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding emotion in embodied perception (e.g., “frayed like worried thoughts”). However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choices under pressure; the shift from isolation to conviction occurs through observation alone, not active renunciation or trade-off. The final stance feels earned thematically but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s face blindness is not a gimmick but the engine of her perception, shaping every artistic choice and culminating in a final act that redefines portraiture. Her internal contradiction—longing to capture essence while unable to see faces—is embodied in tactile exploration and pattern recognition. The discovery of the coin aligns perfectly with her cognitive strengths, making her epiphany feel earned, not convenient. Her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, molding) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on legacy over literalism.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his “diligently curious” trait drives key actions. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—his curiosity never wars with fear, doubt, or competing desire, flattening emotional complexity. The epiphany arrives cleanly without struggle, leaning on label-based interiority (“meticulously curious nature”) rather than embodied tension. His final shift toward seeking mentorship feels earned but costless.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in legacy and longing, with micro-choices (e.g., selecting the smallest pick, closing his eyes to feel rather than see) revealing a hierarchy of values. His interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying emotion through tactile detail (“fingers trembling,” “breath forming ephemeral clouds”). However, the epiphany about “restoring what had been broken” leans slightly toward unearned clarity—though tempered by the ritualistic repair that follows. The rhythm of repair feels inherited rather than discovered, which slightly softens the cost of his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elion’s altruism and Aris’s trust are consistent but lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle; their choices feel ordained rather than wrestled with. The ghost’s motivation is clear yet static, and Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait functions as a plot device without cost or friction. No on-page micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure—decisions unfold smoothly, avoiding ambiguity or error. This undermines emotional realism despite thematic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias’s motivation is vividly rooted in bruised awe and tireless hope, embodied through tactile actions—pressing the puppet head to the spindle, whispering lullabies—that reveal his internal contradiction: devotion to a doomed mechanism yet refusal to yield to silence. His flaw isn’t named but enacted: persistence as both virtue and burden. The final image of him holding the glowing crack shows earned endurance with visible cost—exhaustion, isolation—without sentimentality or diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his reluctance, precision, and quiet empathy emerge through micro-choices (e.g., assembling the device despite exhaustion, guiding travelers without revealing himself). His motivation stems credibly from maternal promise and generational burden, deepening under pressure. The final renunciation of seeing gratitude (“vanished into the night”) feels earned, with visible cost in isolation and spent power. However, his emotional shift toward peace arrives slightly too smoothly, lacking a sharper internal contradiction during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between scientific ambition and familial connection is rendered with specificity, especially in her embodied reactions to the chrysalis and river foam. However, her emotional shift leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“professional success but personal isolation”) rather than fully dramatized contradiction. The final call feels earned but lacks a micro-choice under acute pressure—her insight precedes action without visible struggle. Still, her symphonic-scientific lens grounds her perception credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The vendor’s motivation—finding where stories begin—is compelling and threaded through concrete actions (selecting shards, bottling moonlight), but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; their epiphany feels earned yet lacks struggle. Emotions are embodied (“edges still sharp enough to incise the reality”), but the century of confinement yields little visible tension in present choices. The parole constraint shapes behavior, yet the character’s flaw (fragmenting tales) isn’t tested anew during the opening lull. Final renunciation of searching—accepting possibility over origin—is credible but lightly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—smoothing remorse—is vividly embodied through his culinary metaphor and emotionally contagious gift, driving every choice with consistent internal logic. His struggle against subsumption feels authentic, not performative, and his micro-choices (e.g., gathering specific tools, resisting emotional collapse) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible depth, and interiority occasionally leans into diagnostic phrasing (“emotionally contagious,” “stored remorse”) that borders on label-speak. Still, his final endurance—emerging trembling but lighter—earns credible Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her dual identity as librarian and choir conductor, and her actions align with her empathetic decisiveness. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she moves smoothly from observation to solution without meaningful struggle or flawed missteps. The absence of genuine blind spots or irrationality flattens emotional complexity. Her transformation into “bridge builder” feels earned but tidy, avoiding the messy friction that would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The engineer’s motivation as “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is vivid and consistent, and their internal conflict between precision and chaos manifests in embodied actions like trembling fingers and tears. However, the transformation via synaptic plasticity leans into diagnostic label-speak (“rewiring itself to hold more than one person's consciousness”) without sufficient dramatization of struggle or cost. The final identity blur feels asserted rather than earned through incremental contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s prism-mind is a compelling trait that informs her perception and choices, yet her internal conflict remains underdeveloped—her motivations are clear but lack contradictory impulses in-scene. She acts with near-perfect competence, minimizing struggle or error, which flattens emotional risk. The “latent blaze” is evocative but functions more as motif than embodied contradiction. Her final act feels earned by preparation, not by overcoming inner resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role as a tree-song sculptor and the world’s Great Silence, driving her micro-choices with emotional and tactile specificity. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead embodying sorrow, joy, and empathy through physical sensation (“tears traced paths… like tiny prisms of sound”). The final act—picking up tools with renewed purpose—is earned by the emotional archaeology she performs on the sculpture. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or visible cost beyond tears slightly limits full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—to discover beauty in difficulty—is credibly embodied and drives his actions, but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; instead, it unfolds as a sequence of regret, resolve, and acceptance. His micro-choices (arranging notebooks, lifting the stone) reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost. However, the epiphany arrives with minimal struggle—his “arrogance” is stated, not dramatized under pressure—and the final renunciation feels slightly unearned due to absence of active resistance or temptation to reclaim status.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered through her unique vibrational worldview, with consistent embodiment of emotion as frequency. Her micro-choices—arranging crystals, striking forks—reveal a hierarchy of values centered on empathy-as-resonance. The final shift from cataloging to teaching feels earned by her decades-long pursuit. However, the absence of contradictory impulses or genuine struggle (her method succeeds cleanly) slightly limits psychological depth.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s ambition and sensory trait drive consistent, embodied choices, and her transformation from seeker to teacher feels earned. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—her arc leans toward tidy epiphany rather than messy struggle. The final renunciation of mere study for stewardship carries quiet cost but is slightly smoothed by lyrical abstraction. Her olfactory sensitivity shapes perception but doesn’t force difficult trade-offs under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arion’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as an orchard pilot seeking resilience for his people. His interiority is filtered through tactile details (the arrow tip, harness, water flow), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, his emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—he moves smoothly from curiosity to revelation without resistance or doubt, making the epiphany feel slightly unearned. The broken arrow tip’s activation serves more as plot device than character crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s motivation and professional identity are clear, and her actions align with her goal to cultivate foresight. However, her interiority leans toward diagnostic abstraction (“hazy precision,” “singular convergence”) rather than embodied contradiction or emotional complexity. The flight engineer’s patch functions more as a symbolic prop than a catalyst for internal conflict. While competent and consistent, her characterization lacks the flawed struggle or irrational tension that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eira’s synesthetic perception and burden of legacy are vividly embodied, grounding her motivation in sensory specificity rather than abstraction. Her internal conflict—between duty and a world growing “deaf to beauty”—is credibly rendered through tactile detail (e.g., the amber sheet’s warmth, breath crystallizing). However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; she moves seamlessly from resolve to triumph without struggle or doubt, flattening agency into ritual performance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eldrin’s interiority is vividly embodied—his trembling hands, tear-streaked face, and conflicted pride ground his emotional arc in physical detail. His motivation to “harvest insights from failure” drives concrete choices: gathering driftwood, arranging the spiral, playing specific melodies. The flaw of overconfidence is credibly dramatized in flashback-vision rather than stated, and his transformation feels earned through ritual action. However, his epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic clarity (“true nature of his responsibilities”) without enough irrational contradiction during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her obsession with quantifying emotion drives precise, ethically ambiguous choices. Her internal contradiction (scientific detachment vs. invasive empathy) manifests in micro-choices: arranging her face to disorient, borrowing Thomas’s personality as data. However, Thomas remains underdeveloped beyond his function as a subject, limiting relational depth. The final renunciation of connection for knowledge feels earned but lacks visceral emotional cost beyond intellectual isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ayla’s jitteriness and growth feel earned, with embodied emotion (“fingers instinctively touched,” “hollow space against her chest”) and a credible arc from courier to wonder-bearer. Her internal conflict—between inherited duty and emerging confidence—is subtly rendered without therapy-speak. The mentor’s absence functions as a ghost-pressure rather than a crutch. However, the final shift leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the cost of relinquishing the pendant is felt but not dramatized in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her identity as a grounded mystic seeking proof. Her internal conflict—between skepticism and belief—is present but rendered abstractly rather than through embodied contradiction under pressure. The epiphany feels earned by setup but lacks micro-choices that visibly cost her something in the moment. Emotional progression leans on summary (“joy, sorrow, love, and fear”) rather than sensory, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is rooted in a clear, emotionally resonant inheritance—her grandmother’s charge—and her sacrifices feel earned through embodied loss (e.g., surrendering the memory of laughter). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains consistent with her role as a loom spinner attuned to silence and thread. However, her emotional progression lacks contradictory impulses; she moves steadily without hesitation or internal friction, slightly flattening agency. The final return to weaving sound shows credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orion’s interiority is concrete and consistent—his meekness and quiet determination manifest in embodied choices, not labels. His hesitation with the silk and deliberate trade feel earned, revealing a hierarchy of values (purpose over safety). The transformation from overlooked artisan to quiet authority avoids epiphany, instead emerging through micro-choices under pressure. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; it reads more as sequential uncertainty than active tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sensory map maker’s motivation—uncovering a withheld truth tied to fragmented identity—is compelling and consistent, driving every leap between worlds. Interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception of the shard and atmospheric immersion, avoiding diagnostic labels. However, internal conflict remains largely unarticulated as simultaneous contradictory impulses; instead, desire unfolds linearly without meaningful resistance or self-sabotage in-scene. The final determination feels earned but lacks the micro-choice under duress that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s reticence is embodied through micro-choices (tucking sea glass, recreating the stone stack) and consistent interiority filtered by decades of solitude. His emotional shift feels earned, not epiphanic, and his contradiction—craving connection yet guarding silence—is dramatized in action. The vial of seawater crystallizes his desire without therapy-speak. However, the transition from isolation to kinship leans slightly on the letter chain as external validation rather than fully internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—her “shadowed elation” captures joy weighted by responsibility. Her motivation (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) drives concrete micro-choices (aligning mirrors, modifying beam coordinates). However, her prophetic laughter emerges as a sudden ability without prior struggle or misstep, weakening the “blind spots and limits” criterion. The final renunciation of safety for duty feels earned, but the flaw lacks sufficient dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception of color and light, grounded in his post-transplant sensory recalibration. His motivation—to understand narrative magnetism—feels consistent and deepened by his craft. However, the final realization arrives with minimal internal friction or contradictory impulse; the epiphany is elegant but lacks struggle. The donor heart’s “recognition” borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly softening emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Samuel’s motivation—rooted in witnessing arboreal memory—is compellingly specific and deepened by his moonlight-healing trait and dream-mapping labor. His internal conflict between quantifying sorrow and seeking wisdom feels embodied, not abstract. The final realization emerges organically from his actions with the sextant and pin-chime resonance, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. His raw hands, scarred past, and quiet endurance ground emotional stakes in physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s motivation is vividly embodied through tactile ritual—swaddling saplings with gossamer threads spun from memory—and their emotional arc coheres with the central task. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, grounding longing in concrete sensory detail (“fragments of light that never quite dawned”). The final trembling hands and earned rest reflect a credible endurance with felt cost. However, the character remains archetypal; their contradictions are implied but not dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Eleanor’s internal contradiction—compassion versus reclusiveness—is vividly rendered and drives her choices, especially the climactic note-writing. However, her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“her compassionate nature could exist alongside her reclusive tendencies”) rather than fully embodied revelation. The final micro-choice (smoothing the invitation, writing a note) credibly enacts her renunciation with emotional cost. Yet the absence of tangible interpersonal friction limits the crucible intensity expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eliza’s interiority is concrete and consistent—her sensitivity to "lost things" manifests in embodied choices (carrying the bread, tending guerrilla gardens). Her motivation intensifies credibly from observation to action, culminating in a renunciation (leaving the bread) that forecloses her personal quest with emotional cost. However, the shift from guilt to “tenuous absolution” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“a tenuous absolution settling over her own guilt”) rather than fully dramatized transformation, slightly undercutting the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his role as guardian, and his “gently meticulous” nature informs his actions. However, interiority leans toward abstract reverence rather than embodied contradiction—his emotional stakes feel declared more than dramatized. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant, but the absence of internal friction (e.g., doubt, fatigue, temptation to abandon duty) flattens his endurance. His final hope feels earned by procedure, not personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eliza’s motivation—capturing “the sound of trust breaking”—is idiosyncratic yet consistent, driving her micro-choices with precision. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding emotion in tactile detail (e.g., gripping the watch fob, retreating from narrowed eyes). The contradiction between her calm demeanor and high-stakes deception reveals a hierarchy of values: knowledge over safety, observation over intervention. However, secondary characters remain functional rather than fully individuated, limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The luminous skeptic’s internal contradiction—skepticism versus sensory evidence—is embodied through taste, skin luminescence, and micro-choices like accepting the storm man’s hand. Their transformation feels earned because resistance is dramatized physically (metallic tongue, vibrating ring) before yielding to symbiosis. The final choice forecloses a life of detached observation with tangible cost: dissolution of the compass into skin, merging identity with cosmic force. Flawlessly avoids diagnostic interiority; emotions manifest as ozone, salt, honey—not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Rhodes’ interiority is richly embodied—charcoal-stained fingers, mnemonically precise recall, and emotional conflict between validation and truth—but his transformation leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“broken combination lock of his creativity”) rather than fully dramatized struggle. His final choice feels earned through tactile re-engagement with the portrait, yet the internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension in-scene; regret and determination alternate rather than collide. The memory of Cora functions more as motif than active psychological pressure during key decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her wilting reaction to dishonesty and her yearning for lost conversations—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies credibly toward her decision to embark on the journey. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions manifest physically (“skin paling,” “muscles weakening”) and through concrete choices (packing only truth-aligned items). The backstory with her departed love is economically rendered as a causal wound, not exposition. However, the final renunciation lacks a micro-choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path beyond implied social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—preserving “the color of wonder”—is vividly embodied through her seasonal muteness and tactile sensitivity, driving all key choices. Her interiority is concrete (“feel vibrations others couldn’t detect”) and consistent, with no diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (enduring muteness to serve communal harmony) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: lifelong silence during winter. However, the lack of on-page interpersonal pressure limits demonstration of status dynamics or relationship crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Unit 734’s internal conflict—between mechanical function and “strangely organic” responses—is embodied through tactile actions (polishing, opening the fear-box) and micro-choices that escalate under pressure. Its nostalgia and sacrifice feel earned, not diagnostic, though the phrase “inner static” flirts with label-speak. The transformation into miniature selves resolves its dissonance credibly, with visible cost: the inert original form. Flawed yet coherent, it avoids safety-hedging while remaining individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s motivation—rooted in curation, empathy, and community—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His interiority is embodied through tactile observation (“polished a glass cabinet,” “expert eye”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, his emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses; he moves cleanly from curiosity to purpose without internal friction. The absence of struggle or misstep slightly undercuts the “genuine flaw” expectation for 9+ characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to encrypt vulnerability as strength—is compelling and consistent, rooted in lived experience rather than abstraction. Her internal conflict between isolation and revelation manifests through embodied choices (dance as decryption), not exposition. However, her transformation lacks a visible cost; the “liberation” arrives without sacrifice or struggle that would ground her epiphany. The final smile feels unearned because no prior beat shows her risking failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—recovering her brother’s erased memories—is consistent, deeply personal, and embodied through tactile rituals (coffee grounds, wildflowers, lanterns). Her internal conflict between hope and grief manifests in micro-choices (digging despite resistance, reburial of the crystal) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotion is rendered physically (“trembling hands,” “tears filled Elara’s eyes”) without diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation—not extracting memories but visiting them—feels earned by her prior actions and beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The summoner’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to silence a dangerous prophecy, and his actions align with that goal. However, interiority remains abstract—emotions are named (“quiet intensity,” “profound relief”) rather than embodied through specific, contradictory physical sensations or micro-choices under pressure. The character functions more as a vessel for atmosphere than a psychologically complex individual. His solitary nature is stated but not tested through meaningful internal conflict or flawed decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clara’s motivation is rooted in a visceral, character-specific intuition about buildings, and her emotional arc—from curiosity to inherited fluency—is credibly earned. Mr. Abernathy’s restrained grace and tremor convey age without caricature, and their shared bloodline revelation feels inevitable, not contrived. The “mysterious familiarity” is embodied through gesture (brushing fingers over the seal) rather than stated abstraction. However, his backstory arrives late with minimal prior friction, slightly softening the cost of their kinship.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—charmed skepticism versus yearning for inexplicable truth—is embodied in precise gestures (kneeling, arranging crystals, tear tracing cheek) and culminates in a credible transformation. Her micro-choices (humming with resonance, tucking shell to heart) reveal a hierarchy of values: knowledge over comfort, duty over escape. However, her epiphany leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“burden of containing what others could not bear”) rather than purely dramatized realization, costing 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—his guilt over sacrificing his village for his sister—but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; instead, it’s summarized. His micro-choices (using the thorn as signature, writing the addendum) reveal values with cost, yet his emotional progression leans slightly tidy. The final act feels earned, though the calibrated treason premise isn’t fully dramatized as an active struggle during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The echo singer’s motivation evolves credibly from intellectual curiosity to compassionate action, with micro-choices (kneeling, placing the shell, shifting her song) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her interiority is concrete (“reed-blown melancholy,” “richly perceptive”) and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—accepting that some echoes stem from unreadiness to let go—is earned by prior causality and carries emotional cost. However, the child spirit remains off-page as a true character, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is consistent and embodied—her desire to “salvage something pure” drives tangible choices, especially her careful dream interventions. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are filtered through sensory detail (“glass strangely warm,” “voice like the sound of ice forming”). However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene—it’s more sequential than layered. The final renunciation (choosing gentle revelation over accusation) is earned, with visible cost in emotional labor and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The net-mender philosopher is vividly embodied through tactile detail (gnarled hands, bamboo whisk) and consistent interiority rooted in observation rather than abstraction. His motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—is credibly tied to lived experience and manifests in micro-choices (whistling, net inspection). However, his internal conflict remains under-pressurized; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and his “demure audacity” reads more as lyrical label than dramatized tension with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s motivation as a truth-seeker is consistent and intensifies credibly, driving her to reassemble letters and touch the diamond despite risk. Her interiority shows concrete observation (“fingers growing raw”) and embodied emotion, though her emotional arc leans slightly tidy—hope arrives without sufficient friction from prior trauma. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible sacrifice beyond implied danger. Her flaw (rational skepticism) is well-integrated but doesn’t actively complicate her actions in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motivation—shaping a new dawn through ancient electromagnetic signatures—is consistent and compelling, rooted in isolation and pattern recognition rather than mysticism. His interiority is concrete (“fingertips stained by ozone and midnight oil”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, his choices remain observational rather than decisive; he interprets but never acts to alter the prophet’s rise or his own exile, weakening agency. The final smile feels earned but passive, limiting the cost to emotional endurance without tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s motivation—translating generational silence through sound—is consistent and compelling, rooted in his wistful yet purposeful interiority. His actions (winding the box, capturing its essence, delivering it silently) align with his role as a quiet facilitator. However, his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; his resolve feels steady rather than wrestled. The absence of struggle or doubt slightly flattens the emotional risk, though his micro-choices (e.g., using his largest jar) reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s “logically emotional” trait is embodied through concrete actions—his tuning fork ritual blends technical precision with ancestral duty—and his micro-choices (e.g., pressing hand to stone, closing eyes before striking the fork) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His internal contradiction (logic vs. legacy) acts simultaneously rather than alternating, and the cost of his endurance is felt in the silent aftermath. However, his emotional state occasionally leans on label-like phrasing (“panic warred with strict logic”) that borders on diagnostic summary without deeper physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mapper’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied perception and micro-choices, especially in the tension between vigilance and hope. However, motivation remains largely abstract—“sculpting patience” is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting impulses in real-time decisions. The character feels consistent but lacks a visible trade-off that concretely forecloses an alternative path. Their epiphany leans toward unearned wisdom rather than struggle-born insight.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s internal conflict—between professional obedience and truth-seeking—is credibly rooted in backstory and embodied through micro-choices (e.g., documenting overlooked evidence, opening the lantern). Her “fortified vulnerability” feels specific, not diagnostic, though the epiphany (“It was scripted”) edges toward over-articulation. The controlling supervisor remains off-page, slightly weakening the immediacy of her rebellion. Still, her final smile signals earned transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Father Michael’s interiority is concrete and morally textured—his guilt, doubt, and quiet resolve feel earned through micro-choices (e.g., carrying the letter, hesitating to fix the heart). His contradiction—believing broken people are beyond repair while seeking to mend a symbolic heart—is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation (“I can’t just bring myself to fix it yet”) forecloses a path with visible emotional cost. However, Thomas Grant’s backstory leans slightly toward convenient epiphany rather than fully embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glider’s motivation—driven by a “yearning algorithm” and “steadily curious nature”—is consistent and compelling, though its internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction; it acts with near-perfect alignment between desire and action. The final choice to strike the bell feels earned, yet the absence of hesitation or competing impulses flattens emotional complexity. Its reverence “tempered by irreverence” hints at duality but isn’t dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. Still, the character reads as singular, not archetypal, and its evolution is credibly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is vividly rooted in her role and obsession with absence, and her “brightly attentive” trait drives key discoveries. However, her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses—she moves steadily from curiosity to conviction without meaningful hesitation or self-doubt under pressure. The final choice feels inevitable but not deeply contested within her psyche. Her competence borders on effortless, reducing the sense of genuine struggle against personal limits.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent—empathy driving tangible action—but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in-scene; she executes with serene certainty. Her “calmly intuitive” trait enables the climax but isn’t tested by struggle or doubt, flattening emotional risk. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak, yet her flawlessness under pressure edges toward safety-hedging. Her final choice is earned, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and particular, especially in her tactile relationship with the parasol tip and her embodied reactions to cold and wind. Her motivation—seeking the “sound of approaching endings”—is consistent and deepens credibly through reflection and interaction. However, her shift from seeking death to embracing life leans slightly toward an unearned epiphany; the transformation lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses her original path with visible cost. Marcus’s role as catalyst risks bordering on convenience, though his dialogue remains restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentinel’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile details like the burned letter, but his emotional arc relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His “gentle persuasion” remains a stated trait without visible trade-offs or failure in scene. The character feels consistent yet static—his realization arrives as an epiphany rather than a hard-won shift earned by prior action. No second character appears to test his relational dynamics, limiting crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line walker’s motivation is consistent and rooted in duty, with interiority conveyed through embodied ritual gestures rather than exposition. However, emotional contradiction remains underdeveloped—desire for connection versus isolation is stated but not dramatized in micro-choices. The “strangely honest” trait lacks behavioral friction; it functions as label rather than driver of costly decisions. Final renunciation carries conceptual weight but minimal on-page emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s perceptively calm demeanor is consistent and embodied through tactile actions—tracing arcs, arranging photos—but her internal conflict remains underdeveloped; she functions more as a facilitator than a character with contradictory impulses. Motivation is clear but lacks friction or cost tied to personal stakes. The story avoids therapy-speak but leans on archetype over individuation, especially in the absence of meaningful micro-choices that alter outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar’s motivation is vividly rooted in reverence for language, not mere academic curiosity, and his reticence is credibly redefined as ethical discipline. Interiority is concrete—embodied through trembling hands, whispered phonemes, and tactile interaction with books and crystal—but occasionally veers toward diagnostic abstraction (“weathered innocence,” “fractured sequences”) that borders on label-speak. His transformation from preservationist to translator feels earned, with the cost of isolation legible in his solitude. However, the lack of active opposition or interpersonal friction limits demonstration of contradictory impulses under true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness creates a compelling internal contradiction—seeking to remember what he’s destined to lose—which drives every micro-choice with emotional specificity. His tactile interaction with chalk and driftwood reveals a hierarchy of values: memory over certainty, echoes over permanence. The caretaker functions cleanly as a pressure valve, not a foil, and their exchange sharpens his resolve without diluting his solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in fog-damp sleeves, worn chalk, and directional wood.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her ache for transcendence, tactile intimacy with machinery, and quiet defiance of institutional logic feel specific and lived-in. Her micro-choices (ignoring alarms to study the clock, placing it outside) reveal a hierarchy of values that culminates in earned insight. The only flaw: her mentor appears as a convenient memory rather than an integrated influence, slightly flattening backstory. Still, her final renunciation of force for resonance carries credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mr. Anders’ son and wife are present but function more as emotional conduits than fully pressurized agents; their dialogue reveals grief but not contradictory impulses or status shifts under duress. The therapist’s interiority is consistent and embodied (“decisively kind presence,” “hymning the mundane”), yet her choices lack visible trade-offs—she executes a plan without friction. The vinyl fragment effectively externalizes Mr. Anders’ unspoken regret, and his final stillness reads as Earned Stasis with relational cost. However, the son’s whispered promise (“I’ll fix it”) lacks counterpressure that would reveal deeper character conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and consistent, rooted in trauma from the Great Unraveling, and her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak. However, her emotional state remains largely singular—determined—without layered contradiction or degradation under stress. The final realization feels earned, but internal conflict is implied rather than dramatized through simultaneous opposing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Eleanor’s interiority is vividly specific—her “forgiving skepticism” and inherited bone-setting skill manifest in embodied choices, not exposition. Her motivation evolves credibly from rescue to reconfiguration, and her final micro-choice (practicing bone setting on air) reveals a hierarchy of values with emotional cost. The figure’s vulnerability (“My bones need setting”) forces a renunciation of pure rationality, earned by prior causality. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (skepticism vs. wonder) act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—sharing starlight without fire—is consistent and rooted in trauma, but her internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in-scene; it’s largely retrospective. Her micro-choices (polishing glass, arranging projections) reveal values, yet the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible. The illness tethering her to Earth is stated but never dramatized as an active constraint during decision-making. Still, her earned renunciation of space travel for earthbound stargazing feels credible and costed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—her trauma, lineage, and ethical stance interweave without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (tracing the pendant, proffering it) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality: she trades personal absolution for symbolic stewardship. However, emotional progression leans slightly tidy, bordering on stage-like grief mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist’s internal conflict is stated more than dramatized; his “contradictory impulses” rarely act simultaneously in-scene but alternate as reflective summaries. Motivation (“to collect the shapes of different hopes”) feels abstract until late, and his final peace arrives without a decisive renunciation or micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The spiral seashell fragment prompts reverence, not pressure-driven action. Emotional embodiment leans on lyrical labels (“bittersweet,” “profound motivation”) rather than specific, contradictory physical responses.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring ancestral memory—is rooted in her identity as a tinkerer and storyteller, compelling her to act with urgency. Her interiority is vividly embodied through tactile engagement with the vine and emotional resonance with forgotten songs. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; instead, feelings manifest through action (“fingers traced its path,” “heart ached with purpose”). Her final choice—to activate the device before the community—is earned by prior struggle and carries the cost of cultural fragility made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation is consistent and embodied through ritualistic gestures, yet interior contradiction is minimal—patience and reverence dominate without competing impulses. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible trade-off beyond abstract “hope.” No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics are irrelevant. The absence of internal friction prevents full emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s reflective nature and locksmith identity cohere tightly with her actions; her motivation stems from embodied professional wisdom (“every lock hides a story”) and personal history. Her peripherally focused perception drives key decisions, not just observation. However, the absence of internal contradiction or tangible struggle—her competence borders on effortless—limits emotional complexity. The final renunciation (enduring patience over force) is earned but lacks a visible cost beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fractal weaver’s interiority is richly embodied—“boundary-lessly trapped” isn’t just stated but felt in micro-choices like extinguishing the lamp or handling their own burden with “perfect stillness.” Their emotional arc moves from weary obligation to quiet revelation (“a gift rather than a curse”) without epiphany-speak. The final smile carries earned cost: they remain bound, yet reframe their isolation as connection. Only slight abstraction in “whalebone reverie” risks drifting toward label over sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief manifests through tactile carving, rain patterns, and the ghost of her husband’s teaching. Her micro-choices (e.g., deciding the lion’s pose, timing work to the kettle) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over resolution, creation over catharsis. The contradiction between practicality and haunting emotion operates simultaneously, not sequentially. Final renunciation—accepting love as “both here and gone”—is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cyrus’s motivation—negotiating with his ghost via the camera wheel—is vividly embodied and consistent, driven by regret and chronological disorientation that directly shape his actions. His internal conflict between eroded ambition and desperate hope manifests in tangible micro-choices (e.g., constructing the harness, stepping onto the word-bridge). However, the ghost’s sudden shift from “bitter resentment to quiet recognition” lacks sufficient on-page friction or reciprocal action to fully earn the emotional pivot, slightly undercutting the cost of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motivation—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—is compelling and consistent, driving her technical actions with emotional weight. Her interiority blends professional curiosity (“functionally creative mind”) with poetic reflection without slipping into diagnostic label-speak. The sextant discovery and power restoration feel earned through micro-choices (kneeling, rerouting circuits), though internal contradiction is underexplored. Final renunciation of passive despair in favor of active creation carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is richly rendered through tactile memory and embodied regret, particularly in the workshop flashback triggered by petrichor. His contradiction—steady hands vs. trembling heart—anchors his arc. The bear encounter avoids sentimentality by framing mutual recognition of temporal weight rather than magical intervention. Final micro-choice (offering the watch) earns transformation without over-explaining motive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation—rooted in her grandfather’s legacy and the “architecture of lies”—is consistent and compelling, driving her actions with emotional weight. Her internal conflict between doubt and duty manifests subtly through embodied gestures (tracing the sundial, feeling magnetic pulls) rather than diagnostic labels. The final choice to carry forward the work feels earned, though the lack of active resistance or interpersonal friction limits the cost’s visceral impact. A stronger manifestation of struggle beyond introspection would elevate this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seed collector’s patience and quiet observation feel consistent, but his internal conflict lacks contradiction—his motives are clear yet untroubled by doubt or competing impulses. The fisherman serves as functional pressure but remains archetypal; their dynamic reveals status through craft rather than emotional stakes. The fulgurite glass grounds motivation in legacy, not abstraction, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the protagonist’s “infinitely patient” trait operates more as a stated virtue than a tested limitation with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The traveler’s interiority is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—his profession as obituarist for the living stems from unprocessed guilt and absence, not mere quirk. His micro-choices (tracing the thread, uncapping the pen) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on bearing witness to invisible grief. The final act of writing his own obituary emerges credibly from prior causality: each external portrait has been a deflection from self-reckoning. Flaws like emotional avoidance are consistent and drive the arc without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elorian’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to restore beauty, and his internal conflict—between mechanical heritage and organic longing—is embodied through tactile interactions with the egg and palace. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward abstraction (“bitter sweetness,” “hypothesizing”) rather than fully contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final renunciation feels earned but borders on diagnostic phrasing (“true beauty couldn’t be assembled…”) that risks over-articulation. Still, his micro-choices (assembling the device, rising after failure) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—is embodied through tactile choices (wrapping grafts, shielding roses) rather than stated. Her motivation (“scars can sing”) is dramatized via repeated micro-actions with cost (time, exposure). However, emotional complexity flattens slightly in the final affirmation; her father’s legacy resolves too cleanly without lingering ambiguity or self-doubt under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through her "luminous skepticism" and "realistically imaginative" perception, which directly shape her actions—especially in visualizing water and memories as birds. Her motivation to liberate trapped memories feels consistent and personal, not abstract. However, the final transformation from skeptic to Keeper lacks a micro-choice that shows internal contradiction under pressure; it arrives as an epiphany rather than a wrestled decision. The cost of her new role remains conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentimentalist’s motivation is consistent and poetically rendered, but its interiority remains abstract rather than embodied. Emotions are expressed through lyrical metaphor (“troubling serenity,” “burned bright within its consciousness”) without concrete contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The being acts as a thematic vessel more than a character with legible internal conflict. Final renunciation lacks felt cost because the entity’s nature precludes vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief is tactile, tied to stone, ribbon, and butterflies—and his micro-choices (unspooling ribbon, retracing steps) reveal a hierarchy of values. His motivation stems from generational ritual and spectral mentorship, consistent throughout. However, the spectral mentor remains underdeveloped as a pressure source; their influence feels atmospheric rather than causally active. The final act of carving “collective grief” is earned, but the emotional contradiction (emptiness vs. overflow) isn’t dramatized in-scene with simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alaric’s interiority is concrete and conflicted—his precision wars with communal neglect, embodied in tactile interactions with the bob and rake handle. His transformation is earned through micro-choices: kneeling, shouting for help, displaying the broken tool. The final renunciation of solitary control carries visible cost (loss of identity as sole timekeeper) and forecloses his old path. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation—discovering “the shape of intentions”—is consistent and deepened through tactile engagement with artifacts, especially the sovereign case. His blithe nature contrasts meaningfully with the gravity of his work, creating interior tension without over-explanation. The final revelation of sacrificial love reframes his understanding credibly, and his decision to reseal the tapestry shows earned restraint. However, his emotional shift lacks a contradictory impulse in-scene; he moves cleanly from curiosity to reverence without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in past failures and community dependence. Her “groundedly imaginative” trait informs her methodology, but internal contradiction remains underexplored—she’s resolute without visible struggle in-scene. The micro-choice to move the camp westward is precise and stakes-driven. However, emotional embodiment leans descriptive over visceral; feelings are named (“quiet determination”) rather than physically rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The copyist’s motivation—teaching dust to tell stories—is rooted in lived trauma from the story famine and manifests through precise, embodied actions (ink-stained fingers, whispered lyrics). Her internal contradiction (diligent functionary vs. revolutionary) is consistent but under-pressurized; we see her calm resolve but not meaningful struggle or error under threat. The final choice lacks a visible cost beyond implied risk, weakening Earned Stasis. No secondary characters appear, so relationship dynamics don’t apply.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s interiority is richly rendered with embodied sorrow and determination, and her micro-choices—like removing her working mask or applying powder—reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her motivation occasionally drifts into diagnostic self-awareness (“the mirage of safety was precisely what made life worth living”) that edges toward label-speak rather than dramatized struggle. The contradiction between seeking permanence through impermanent media is compelling but not fully enacted under pressure. Her flaws shape her art but don’t visibly complicate a high-stakes decision within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Milo’s “rationally rebellious” nature is embodied through precise actions—cleaning relics, pocketing the cog—not just stated. His internal conflict between reverence for ancient knowledge and rejection of modern dogma plays out in micro-choices with visible cost (isolation, risk). However, his emotional range remains narrowly intellectual; the “abrasive calm” borders on static, lacking degradation under pressure. The final preservation act feels earned but leans slightly tidy given the depth of societal opposition implied.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eleanor’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her dedication to preserving vanishing arts and uniting divided voices. Her "expectantly resigned" demeanor evolves credibly into hopeful determination, showing internal contradiction without diagnostic self-awareness. However, her transformation leans slightly on summary rather than fully embodied micro-choices under pressure, especially in the climactic shift toward retirement. The zither rosette effectively anchors her emotional arc but doesn’t force a decisive renunciation with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory perception and micro-choices (e.g., pruning as metaphor for personal sacrifice), and his motivation—rebellion through reconnection—is consistent and embodied. However, the “synaptic plasticity” explanation veers into diagnostic label-speak that distances emotion from action. His contradiction (gift vs. burden of memory-tasting) is present but not dramatized in simultaneous tension—more stated than lived under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s involuntary truth-telling creates compelling internal conflict and forces high-stakes choices, especially her decision to reveal the transformer room and confront the supervisor. Her motivation—to preserve wonder in routine—is credibly embodied and directly shapes her climactic actions. The maintenance supervisor’s parallel desire adds moral complexity without artificial balance. However, the Bureau agents remain functional rather than fully individuated, slightly limiting relational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aria’s interiority is richly embodied—her noticing is tactile, sensory, and emotionally grounded. Her motivation (to understand why houses breathe) is consistent and intensifies through ritualistic action. The final realization feels earned because it arises from her methodical engagement with objects, not abstract musing. However, her internal contradiction remains understated; we see devotion but not the doubt or cost that would deepen her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The diver’s internal conflict between academic certainty and destabilizing revelation is embodied through tactile hesitation and shifting perception, not abstract summary. The statue’s “incisively kind” nature manifests in nuanced telepathic guidance that avoids didacticism. However, the diver’s transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-resistance—acceptance arrives with minimal friction. The final nod feels earned but could be deepened by a visible renunciation of prior methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “balancedly daring” nature and grim optimism are consistently embodied through micro-choices (e.g., methodical proof-testing, final die placement) and internal contradiction (precision vs. the chipped die’s imperfection). His emotional arc—from regret to earned hope—is credibly rendered without therapy-speak. The flaw of hesitation is tied directly to both backstory and resolution. However, “grim optimism” occasionally borders on label-like phrasing rather than fully dramatized behavior in mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The insomniac painter’s motivation—proving kindness transcends time—is deeply rooted and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers trembled slightly,” “felt the truth in her bones”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. The trait “methodically hopeful” manifests in systematic research and precise brushwork, not just stated. However, internal contradiction is underexplored; her insomnia feels atmospheric rather than a source of simultaneous impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Both characters are vividly embodied: Khira’s gnarled fingers and rasped dialogue contrast with the guide’s historically oriented restraint, revealing values through micro-choices (e.g., offering spices vs. lens). Motivation is consistent—rescuing dying arts—but the guide’s passivity in driving action slightly limits agency. Khira’s “The bread remembers” crystallizes endurance with cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring sensory embodiment (“rosewater dread,” “slow roots finding light”).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Esme’s motivation—defying fate through counter-clockwise time—is vividly embodied in her actions and tools, not just stated. Her “neatly inventive” mind drives micro-choices under pressure, especially during the yoyo puzzle sequence. Internal conflict between obsession and sanity is rendered through sensory detail (“cold water seeping through trousers”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, her emotional arc lacks a tangible cost beyond abstract “bleak exhilaration,” weakening the Earned Stasis requirement for full closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied fear and paradox-driven epiphanies, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Motivation intensifies coherently from flight to confrontation, culminating in a credible self-recognition that feels earned. The whispering advisor as future self creates a compelling internal crucible without external crutches. Minor deduction for slightly tidy emotional resolution in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prophet’s motivation—to transform obstacles into instruments—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., selecting specific driftwood, striking patterns mirroring storms). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and instead manifests through tactile ritual and sensory engagement. However, her internal contradiction remains underexplored; we see competence but not struggle, limiting emotional depth. The absence of on-page secondary characters prevents relationship-based crucibles, though this fits the single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s motivation—driven by filial devotion and cartographic duty—is consistent and intensifies credibly. His internal conflict between obsession and responsibility culminates in a renunciation that forecloses escape but embraces guardianship, with embodied dread transforming into purpose. The reed whistle and spiral patterns serve as concrete anchors for his emotional arc. However, the shift from “questioning” to “accepting” the watchers lacks micro-resistance or hesitation on the page, slightly softening the cost of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eleanor’s emotionally rational temperament is credibly embodied through her methodical documentation and controlled reactions to evidence of corruption. Her motivation—to recover silenced voices—is consistent and intensifies through concrete micro-choices (photographing initials, retrieving the ledger). However, internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her emotional rationality functions more as a label than a site of tension. The absence of another on-page character limits relational crucible, but her solitary focus aligns with the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The surveyor’s stoic sensitivity is embodied through precise actions—kneeling, stripping down, annotating—not summarized. His motivation to excavate “abandoned dreams” drives tangible choices with visible cost (cold meal, solitude, physical exertion). The internal contradiction fuels credible endurance rather than tidy resolution. However, the final note’s philosophical question leans slightly toward abstraction without a concrete micro-choice anchoring it.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his identity as a logical page indexer, and evolves credibly when confronted with ancestral revelation. His interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak and remains embodied through tactile observation (e.g., “ran his fingers over the script”). However, his emotional progression leans slightly tidy—epiphany arrives with minimal struggle or contradiction, lacking the irrational friction that would ground such a seismic self-reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern maker’s motivation is vividly rooted in grief and craft, with interiority rendered through embodied actions—polishing gems, folding cranes—rather than diagnostic labels. His contradictory impulses (desire to release grief vs. need to preserve it) operate simultaneously in scene, especially when selecting the final gem. The final act of placing the lantern in the basilica earns his emotional shift without tidy resolution. However, the “shadow detached from his soul” remains abstract, slightly weakening the causal link to his present state.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s grief and purpose are credibly fused, and his micro-choices (descending during the shield downtime, kneeling at the amphitheater) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by loss. However, interiority occasionally defaults to abstract phrasing (“bleak exhilaration,” “intangibly tangible”) rather than fully embodied contradiction. His motivation is consistent but leans on concept over visceral struggle in key moments. The transformation feels earned, yet lacks the granular emotional friction that would elevate it to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motivation and interiority are vividly rendered, but her “perpetually surprised” trait functions more as a repeated label than a lived contradiction with tangible cost. Her epiphany—“she had been both the seeker and the missing piece”—feels earned through action yet borders on diagnostic phrasing without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it. The pilgrim exerts thematic pressure but remains off-stage during the climax, weakening relational crucible potential.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Martin’s interiority is richly embodied—trembling fingers, bile, weathered cheeks—and his contradictory impulses (erasure vs. longing for truth) act simultaneously in scene. His final choice to close his business is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. However, the epiphany about his grandfather’s unconditional love leans slightly toward unearned clarity given the compressed timeframe; a hairline slip in emotional calibration at climax prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in personal history and professional ethos. Her “uncommonly thoughtful” nature manifests in embodied choices—stillness, offering the drawer pull—that align with her goal. However, Rennett’s shift from rigid hostility to apology lacks sufficient on-page pressure or micro-behavioral cues to feel fully earned; his emotional arc hinges on symbolic recognition without intermediate struggle. The drawer pull’s warmth as a supernatural cue risks substituting for psychological causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret, irony, and flickering hope feel lived-in rather than diagnostic. Her micro-choices (e.g., using utility poles as stars) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The compass functions as both memory and burden, grounding her emotional arc in tangible action. However, the epiphany about “aligning heart and action” edges close to label-speak without sufficient friction from competing impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied sensations (“trembling hands,” “water in my chest”) and contradictory impulses—seeking truth while haunted by amnesia. Motivation to “kindle empathy” emerges credibly from disorientation and discovery, culminating in the earned act of signing the ball. The final renunciation of linear time for cyclical teaching feels rooted in prior beats. However, the younger self’s appearance borders on convenient revelation rather than fully dramatized confrontation, slightly undercutting emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eliora’s interior conflict—between human love and necessary metamorphosis—is vividly embodied in tactile details (fingers steady despite heart tremor, roots drinking moonlight). Her motivation is consistent and intensifies credibly toward the climax. The brother’s spectral presence functions as emotional crucible without over-explaining. However, the transformation lacks micro-choices that concretely narrow options; it unfolds more as inevitability than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cartomancer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her awe, dread, and “willingly perplexed” state manifest through tactile details (the saucer, the cards) and micro-choices (tracing hands, accepting the crack). Her motivation—to recover lost time after childbirth—is consistent and intensifies credibly. However, her emotional arc leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness (“cloudbound repentance,” “time could not be rushed”) that edges close to label-speak in pivotal beats, diluting raw immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eli’s pacifism and emotional arc are consistent and embodied, especially in their gravitationally lighter state reflecting inner joy. However, internal contradiction is underexplored—Eli’s struggle feels more like serene endurance than active tension between light and dark. The “shadow work” concept is named but not dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses. Final renunciation is earned, but the cost of isolation remains abstract rather than viscerally felt in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ian’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—his desire for solitude clashes with his catalytic presence—but his epiphany arrives with slight diagnostic clarity (“transformation wasn’t something to be studied but experienced”) that edges toward label-speak. His relinquishment of the vials feels earned, yet the village girl remains more symbol than character, limiting relational crucible depth. Micro-choices (releasing a bug, handing over the collection) reveal hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Flaws are consistent, though the “orchestrates coincidences” trait borders on unmotivated magic without clearer constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s calm inventiveness and embodied tension are consistent, with micro-choices (e.g., brushwork, dialogue) revealing hierarchy of values under pressure. However, his internal contradiction remains implied rather than dramatized in simultaneous impulses—his composure lacks a visible struggle that would elevate motivation to 9+. The secondary guard serves only as messenger, applying minimal relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The eel herder’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied tension—bare feet on frictionless stone, trembling hands—and her precognitive curse informs every micro-choice. Her motivation (fulfilling a mentor’s vow) intensifies under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of control for harmony. However, the emotional arc leans slightly toward epiphany over struggle; the shift from torment to peace lacks a visible, contradictory internal battle in-scene. The final endurance feels earned but borders on tidy given the high-stakes cosmic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maia’s interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied contradictions like “furiously tranquil” revealing her suppressed fire. Her motivation—to map scars of censorship—emerges organically through action (handling the envelope, tracing wounds) rather than exposition. However, her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choices under escalating pressure; the shift from silence to writing feels inevitable but not hard-won through on-page struggle. The cost of her rebellion remains abstract, lacking a concrete forfeiture or tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s interiority is vividly embodied—his mechanical arm, needle card, and motto reveal a coherent worldview under pressure. His contradictions (fierce yet diplomatic, precise yet open to chaos) manifest in micro-choices, like choosing intellectual fencing over physical display. The student interaction shows authentic mentorship, not exposition. However, his emotional arc leans slightly toward idealized competence without tangible struggle or blind spots that complicate resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his fragmented identity versus unwavering mission, grief for Elias versus devotion to their shared cause. His molting trait creates genuine tension: memory gaps threaten continuity of purpose, yet his actions remain consistent, revealing a hierarchy of values (beauty over safety, preservation over self). The coffee tin anchors his emotional arc, and his final act—scattering seeds among books—feels earned by prior causality. However, Elias exists only in reflection, limiting relational crucible impact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pianist’s motivation—grief fused with artistic defiance—is rooted in specific loss (his daughter) and intensifies credibly toward his final act. His interiority avoids therapy-speak, instead channeling longing through embodied musical choices and tactile interactions with the clock. The micro-choice to descend into the archive despite systemic shutdown demonstrates a hierarchy of values with clear cost: abandoning his public role for private redemption. However, the transition from passive performer to active time-defier lacks a moment of visceral doubt or hesitation that would deepen contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception (“warm and pulsing” seed, “luminous doubt”) and her empirically whimsical nature informs micro-choices (interpreting dreams as data). However, her doubt about worthiness arrives late without prior contradiction, making the internal conflict feel underdeveloped rather than layered. The final choice is earned but lacks a visible trade-off beyond time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tutor’s interiority is richly embodied—his “RBG hands” tremble, his breath syncs with waves—but his motivation hinges on abstract yearning (“color of unspoken apologies”) rather than concrete contradiction. His final act (whispering his brother’s name) earns emotional closure, yet lacks a decisive renunciation or trade-off with visible cost. The story avoids therapy-speak but leans on lyrical epiphany over micro-choices that alter tactics.
