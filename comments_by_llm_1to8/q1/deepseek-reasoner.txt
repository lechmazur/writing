  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal pivot from thief to protector lands with genuine moral weight, though her initial motivation ("to press your ear against destiny's door") reads more poetic than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Father Ansel's internal contradiction—defender of order confronting his own limitation—is dramatized in scene, not summarized.

Her motivation ("to stand by the unremembered") is dramatized through her focus on the frozen tableau of abandonment, tilting her final stance. The final choice to use the phase transition protocol is a high-stakes gamble earned by her established endurance. A slight deduction for a minor filter-verb stack ("She felt a momentary, impossible cold") in the peak closure beat.

The cost is felt in the empty palette, reconfiguring her purpose from archivist to activator.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive evolves credibly from survival and loss to investigative purpose, with embodied grief (“her body ached… a scorched testament”) grounding interiority. Contradictory impulses—artist’s eye for beauty repurposed to read secrets—surface in the frost‑trail moment. The final renunciation of rebuilding her studio carries believable cost tied to identity. Slight tidiness around her swift acceptance of the smuggling legacy keeps this from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive is crystalline and embodied—her deafness and tactile attunement anchor motive and method. The piece shows her competence under pressure without resorting to diagnostic labels. Internal contradiction is mild (monastic focus with little friction beyond stamina), limiting depth. Still, her micro‑choices with the forks reveal character through action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silas’s exhaustion-driven pursuit of stillness is specific and consistent, and his reluctance-to-commitment arc reads cleanly through tactile choices (restoring, signaling, diving). Interiority is concrete (“chased stillness,” the bone-handled opener, the watchtower) and avoids stock affect. The internal contradiction (craving quiet vs. answering a light’s call) is present but resolves a bit smoothly, with limited on‑page cost. The final acceptance of “homecoming” feels earned but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—sustaining the community across generations—is clear and consistently enacted through midnight runs and the final public declaration. Interiority is filtered through a communal “we,” so her contradictions are implied rather than directly dramatized. The moment she opts to transform secrecy into shared truth via the bell feels earned. Still, nuanced internal conflict is mostly inferred, keeping this from the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to locate and release “unused love” tied to a past-life wound—is clear and consistently embodied in tactility (silver nitrate hands, breath control, camera use). Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than abstract. The turn from seeker to vessel is earned by on‑page acts, though internal contradiction is minimal and the path feels smooth, with little genuine friction testing her resolve. The emotional cost is mainly the relinquishing of the tear, which reads quiet but credible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular to her craft, and her agency—choosing a geometric solution under paralysis—drives the climax. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“moss that pulsed…,” the terror of the looping second), though contradiction and personal flaw are lightly sketched. The final cost (the dimmed fragment, shaken certainty) reads, but the piece leans more on concept than a thorny inner conflict. Strong, but not yet the layered ambiguity of a publish‑now character study.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and her actions under pressure (decoding the keys, jamming the door) align with it. Interiority is economical and embodied (raw wrist impressions; steady hands under rising threat). What’s missing is a live, contradictory impulse on the page—she never wavers or pays an internal price beyond resolve. The “staggering/patiently strategic grace” phrasing repeats and flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Aris’s obsession and professional competence align cleanly, with embodied emotion (synesthetic color-hearing, tears in the helmet) under pressure. Motivation is specific and sustained, and the final acceptance reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—driven healer versus witness—rather than dramatized as live friction in multiple beats. A touch more on-the-spot self‑conflict would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s ethical pivot is motivated and earned, with her craft-specific worldview shaping each perception and choice. The internal conflict between professional mandate and moral responsibility spikes convincingly when the couple’s gaze reframes the commission. Embodied detail (camera, perch, flowers) reveals her under pressure. The price—refusing the client and risking income/retaliation—is felt even if not enumerated.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and contradictions are clear and embodied through precise craft actions; the glass process doubles as psychology without feeling pasted on. Her renunciation—making only one orb and abandoning the “icy armor”—reads as an earned choice with felt cost. Small spoken lines (“The gatherer… The punty rod…”) reveal temperament and ritual under pressure. A touch of tidy resolution smooths rough edges but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Leo’s interiority is specific and embodied—shaking hands, claustrophobia flaring as he kneels—while contradictory impulses (terror versus resolve) operate simultaneously. His decoding choice grows from motivation and history, and the final stance shift (meeting Marcus) is earned. A few abstract phrases (“prove that vulnerability is power”) edge toward thesis. Overall, micro-choices under pressure reveal a coherent hierarchy of values with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear, specific motivation and method; her obsession channels into concrete micro-choices (waiting, selecting nightshade, pushing through fatigue). Internal contradiction is limited—she is largely a steady monomaniac—so the emotional torque is modest. The cost is present (exhaustion, surrender of the night) but not deeply conflicted. Still, she reads as particular and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Unit 734’s composed, curious nature motivates every move, and the “I wonder” anomaly cleanly seeds its present drive. Interiority is apt for a robot—precise, observational—yet still individuated. Internal conflict is subtle (directive vs. emergent curiosity) rather than dynamically contested in‑scene, which keeps pressure modest. The final renunciation of searching for a “place” in favor of a process is earned but carries limited on‑page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to thaw the frozen mistrust with Leo—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (stealing/keeping the lens, deciding to show the tickets silently) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied through the lens and doodles rather than diagnostic labels. The cost is primarily emotional vulnerability, felt but modest. Leo’s presence provides relational pressure, though his interior remains off-page, keeping the crucible focused but narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and methods are precise and consistent, embodied by thorn‑scarred hands and the polishing ritual. Her refusal to stop polishing under bureaucratic pressure reveals character through action. Internal contradiction is minimal—she’s steadfast rather than torn—so complexity leans on endurance rather than ambivalence. Status dynamics with the official are legible and contribute to her earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive—to prove time moves sideways—is clear and coherently drives each action, with tactile interiority (calloused hands, goosebumps) grounding her. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or felt risk; she meets no resistance beyond procedure. The “obliging” trait reads, but her competence faces minimal friction. The final acceptance is earned but low-cost, limiting depth of character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive and tactics are clear and embodied—lifting the cello above the flood, testing phrases, committing to the crescendo. Internal contradiction is mild (awe vs. risk to instrument/sanctuary) and could be sharpened. The felt cost is largely emotional/physical effort rather than a deeper renunciation. Still, micro‑choices under pressure are specific and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and intensifies—from fever-clear duty to physical risk to the grim acceptance of consequence. Interiority stays embodied (“baptism of ice,” the bare hand she’ll regret) and character-specific (fault tolerance vs. clarity). The contradictory impulses—despair vs. obligation—coexist in scene and drive the “margins” choice. The final endurance (sending the alert, then bearing the knowledge) reads as an earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s motive (to weigh a dead man’s confession) is clear, character‑specific, and drives each choice from tunnel to valve. His “religiously skeptical” stance usefully contradicts his felt experience, sharpening his need to test rather than believe. Embodied stress reads credibly (shaking headlamp, burning muscles), and the final exhaustion feels earned. A minor limit: interior conflict is strong but could sharpen once more at the wheel (a flicker of doubt vs. risk) to hit peak depth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motivation is clean and particular—his vow to witness without judgment governs every choice. The internal tension between “not interfering” and acting to preserve his function is present but soft; he resolves it by leaning into witnessing, so contradiction doesn’t bite. Emotion is largely conveyed via atmosphere rather than embodied stress, which keeps him a touch abstract. Still, the origami choice and the non‑mending stance at the fault reveal a coherent, disciplined character.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—nurturing wonder—drives specific, adaptive choices (not pushing, trying music, then risking the eclipse plan), and her “cautious exuberance” registers as a credible internal tension. Leo is spare but legible via behavior, tear, and the single line that reframes the scene. Actions align with motives without convenience. The change (Leo speaking) feels earned rather than engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions (fireplace, diaries, cross‑referencing) align. Interiority is textured and embodied (“pulse quickened,” “terrible new weight”). However, there’s little on‑page contradiction or micro‑conflict; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond recognition. The final commitment reads as mission acceptance rather than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leo’s motive and worldview are distinct and consistent, and his small embodied choices (locking up, braving the causeway, holding the specs) align with them. Interiority is textured, but internal contradiction is mild—hesitation yields quickly to acceptance, with limited on‑page struggle. The relationship beat with Alistair adds pressure but doesn’t fully fracture Leo’s stance. The final renunciation of the old life lands but could register more cost in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Father Ansel’s motive—maintaining the anchor via curated silence—evolves credibly into a self‑interrogation that forces a brave reversal. Interiority is particular (looping, singing bowl, silver moonbeam; hands trembling) and the choice to cease looping carries felt risk. Some emotion is abstracted in conceptual language, slightly softening embodied complexity. Still, the renunciation and integration land as earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s desire is precise and embodied—“chronologically homesick” crystallizing into conducting the world’s unheard symphonies—and her tactics (memory‑mapping) align. Sensory‑anchored interiority (pipe tobacco, shell pressure, window angle) individualizes her. The internal contradiction (desperation vs. exhaustion clock) is present but not deeply contested in‑scene, so choices feel assured more than precarious. The visible cost (collapse into sleep) credibly closes a path and earns the shift from longing to arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive (“to conquer the labyrinth of self”) is clear and consistent, and the final acceptance of her fear of ordinariness credibly reframes her pursuit. Interiority is embodied in tactile ways (hovering feet, inverted-gravity chamber) rather than pure abstraction. The contradictory impulses—power as defiance vs. the dread of being ordinary—meet on the page in the pool scene. A touch of declarative phrasing (“born of a fear of being ordinary”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to break through numbness is precise and embodied, and her micro-choices (undertaking the pilgrimage, accepting the mallet, escalating her strikes) align with that motivation. The interiority is sensorially grounded in vibration rather than abstract labels, which feels character-specific. Internal contradiction is present but soft—desire vs. distrust of her voice—so the crucible could tighten further. Still, the arc from tentative to released reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives (meticulous integrity, credible curiosity) consistently drive her choices, from opening the door to the pigeon to the lateral data analysis. The internal pull between fear (being followed, curfew) and duty (sending evidence) is active on the page. Reactions are embodied (fumbling the cap, tightened shoulders). The final renunciation of safety for record‑keeping reads earned and particular to her.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior conflict—preserving the vial versus risking its loss—drives the final choice with embodied cost. Her grief arrives as a credible, uncontrollable response to the scent and reframes her motive on the page. Kaelen is thinner but functions as precise pressure and witness. The final act of breaking the seal is well earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kael’s drive (“to discover the texture of time”) is clear and consistent, and his ethically playful bent is dramatized through his pattern‑making and ultimate renunciation. Interiority is concrete (heart rhythm, ache from the mandala) and contradictory impulses clash on the page. The final refusal feels earned and costly. A slight tilt toward abstract summarizing at the end trims the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her acoustical sensitivity and family creed, and her mid-scene pivot from fighting silence to honoring it reads as a credible micro‑choice under pressure. Interiority is specific (listening for a dome’s hum; recalling her grandfather’s counsel) and embodied. The internal conflict is present but modest; danger and cost remain mostly emotional rather than materially pressing. The relationship with the grandfather frames motive and charges the ending without crowding the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s professional pride and practiced detachment are sharply drawn and tested by the invasive surge of real empathy. Her micro‑choices—continuing the blend, testing the petal, then reversing the charge—track a credible moral pivot. The final renunciation (refusing to send the vial, absorbing the cost herself) is earned and specific. A slight convenience in her instantaneous diagnostic understanding of the fusion keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are clear, rooted in her response to the symphony and her respect for unseen labor, and her micro‑choices (rewriting the address, including the photo, deciding to meet Henry) feel earned. The moment of doubt after the returned letter adds credible internal friction. Emotional embodiment is specific (heels on cobblestones, the breezy upper floor), though her flaws remain gentle and largely untested. Henry’s brief on‑page presence is distinct and human without slipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s desire “to graft herself onto community” clearly motivates each step, and her refusal to expose the artist in favor of pledging her hands is an earned, character‑specific choice. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and environment rather than labels. The internal tension between loyalty to the community’s curiosity and protection of the artist is credible but could register a sharper felt cost. Still, the final pledge and collaborative making show a meaningful, motivated shift.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s obsession and method are vivid and consistent, and her choices (climb, focus, borrow time) clearly arise from motive. Interiority is concrete (the pendant’s cold, the dissonant hum) but her internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers or pays an emotional price beyond strain. The final endurance feels earned but relatively cost‑light. Still, the character reads particular and embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation (quantifying emotion to resolve ambiguous loss) is specific, embodied, and drives each action. Her contradictory impulses—cold mathematical rigor vs. raw grief—collide on the page at the “hollow zero” and the collapse into touch. The final renunciation/repricing (map the impact, not the absence) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor neatness to the epiphany keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s yearning “to become visible” drives concrete micro-choices (pocketing the tape, playing it, shifting his practice to caching comfort books). Interiority is specific and embodied (dust motes, pipe chases, the groaning machine). The internal tension—desire for visibility vs. commitment to invisibility—registers, though it never bites as sharply as it could. The ending earns an endurance choice with a modest felt cost: he remains unseen to be what others need.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s control-versus-surrender conflict is specific and embodied (the knot of anxiety, soil-smudged hands) and her micro-choices shift from pruning to collaborative rebuilding. Her professional motive (study under duress) credibly drives perception and action. The change is earned through tactile observation and work, not just declaration. A slight tendency to state realizations (“She no longer just studied behaviors; she embodied them”) trims the edge off the interior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive (“to thresh meaning from experience”) anchors every action, and her embodied perception under pressure feels specific (slick shale, pulsing warmth). Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. commitment, futility vs. insistence—are present but lightly dramatized. The shift from solitary seeking to exchange-based meaning reads earned by the night’s conversation. A hair of neatness in the epiphanic turn keeps it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s anomaly-driven curiosity and the pilgrim’s stated aim create clear motives that guide concrete choices (placing the pearl, consenting to the inhabitation). The cost—Elara’s clairvoyance “forever altered”—lands as a credible change. Internal contradiction is present but mild; the acceptance arrives smoothly with little resistance. The relationship dynamic is gentle rather than pressurized, limiting sharper character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s vocation-rooted drive and embodied method (“navigated absences”) create a specific, credible interiority. The personal stake turns sharply when the Sea‑Scribe links to her exile, revealing layered motive beyond professional duty. The final choice to “write the record…as a paradox” reads earned, with a felt cost. Slight tidiness—minimal on‑page resistance to the epiphany—keeps this shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation and contradictions are clear: a control‑driven cartographer compelled to step off‑map, with embodied fear (“heart a frantic drum”) undercutting meticulousness. Her micro‑choices (trusting pavement‑arrows, grasping the punch, speaking the guarded truth) align with escalating pressure. The voiced cost—fear and loneliness—lands credibly without therapy‑speak. Slight tidiness at the end skews neat, but the earned renunciation reads true at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (cataloging truth, seeking quiet) and trait set (“sympathetic skeptic,” “courageous kindness”) manifest in concrete micro-choices—she holds the warming tile, then chooses to answer rather than rationalize. Interiority is vividly embodied through bone‑deep sound and tactile heat. The internal contradiction (skepticism vs. empathy) runs in-scene and drives the pivot to transcription. The cost is felt but modest, skewing toward a tidy emotional calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Eliana’s core want—to learn what comes after goodbye—is clear and drives her choice to step into the vortex. Interiority is specific (boredom shading into “intrigue”) but shows limited contradiction or struggle at the moment of commitment. The cost is felt conceptually more than emotionally, with little embodied hesitation. Still, actions align cleanly with motive, and the final shift in stance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives are clear and layered: a mathematician seeking a “fair trade” collides with filial love and inherited craft. Her patient inspection, use of the ink, and final decision to protect Aris show micro‑choices under pressure. The internal contradiction—rigid ethics vs. the messy grace of her father’s last act—plays on the page. A touch of thesis-like phrasing softens the grit of her struggle but doesn’t derail it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her attention-as-agency reads credibly through concrete micro-choices (closing her eyes, translating hum to line). The discovery reconfigures her understanding without contradiction. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little resistance beyond time’s narrow window. The cost is gentle (the moment passes), so her endurance/renunciation remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    K’s motivation is clear and particular—seeking the “texture of memories” rather than their own name—and their decisive act (submitting the dossier) aligns with this evolving drive. The internal shift when the label reweights their priorities is credible and embodied (“a cold stone in K’s chest”). However, opposition remains largely atmospheric; we don’t see an on‑page test that forces a painful trade‑off beyond the ethical pivot. A touch more friction or risk would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive to decode the universe’s “hum” is specific and embodied through tactile choices (touching the cello, using the shell, bowing a single string). The familial debates refracted through sound create credible contradictory loyalties (astronomer vs. luthier) that she resolves by synthesis. The cost—reframing her myth‑buster identity into a maker/listener—is felt but subtle. A slightly cleaner on‑page friction before she chooses to play would deepen the micro‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s motives (bridge between founders’ vision and OmniCorp’s demands) are clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices: encoded graffiti, the negotiated relocation of Hem, and accepting the foundation chip. Her contradictory impulses—orderly planning versus preserving chaos—operate simultaneously in scene. The Hem exchange shows status dynamics and trust that raise the emotional cost. The final stance (accepting the “anchor” burden) reads earned, with credible price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (to witness and preserve the last pristine craters) is clear and drives credible micro‑choices: lifting the grain, choosing to wait through cold, decoding the glyph, and reframing her camera to the sky. Interiority is specific and embodied (“heater struggling,” “muscles ached”), with melancholy sharpening into urgency. The internal contradiction is modest but present—reverent melancholy versus the stubborn will to endure—enough for this length. No dialogue or secondary character pressure appears, but the solitary crucible works.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—decode the feedback to save the voyage—and her competence drives clear micro‑choices (water bowl, lamp angle, soldering the bypass). The tactile/sound‑based perception grounds her interiority without generic labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she remains serenely assured throughout, so we miss a sharper stress fracture under time pressure. The apprentice and client add light external pressure but don’t force a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s professional temperament and drive are vivid, and her interior shift from map‑editor to witness is earned through concrete encounters (the obsidian ice, the fisher’s word). Contradictory impulses—rational cartography vs. awe at an ontological “source”—coexist credibly. Agency is largely interpretive but culminates in a clear stance and vocational renunciation. The cost is subtle (identity and purpose), not dramatic, which trims the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear, and her embodied way of “listening with her bones” gives her interior a distinct texture. The piece is light on contradictory impulses or visible internal cost beyond endurance, so complexity is limited. Still, her final committed walk reads as a credible, earned expression of her defining patience. Absence of a second on‑page character keeps relational pressure minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to harness silence as rescue-by-witness) is clear and governs each micro‑choice, especially the crucial override of recoil to offer her own memories. Contradictory impulses—urge to withdraw vs. chosen reciprocity—are dramatized rather than summarized. The emotional cost lands in the exchange and in accepting the sender’s death. Slight safety in her competence (things go right once she calibrates) keeps it from reaching the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is precise and pressure‑sharpened: the son of a liar must act without “crying wolf,” choosing truth as tactic. Interiority is concrete (“silence that is not peace but prison”), and micro‑choices track: pushing the loosened door, descending, prying the lattice, deciding what story to speak. The contradiction—silence as safety vs. speech as risk—drives the climax credibly. The endurance at the end (waiting to tell his truth as the boat arrives) carries a felt cost of likely suspicion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s fear-versus-pull micro‑choice to take the bead reads motivated and specific, and Elara’s “lovingly venomous” guidance gives their dynamic texture. Interiority is concise but concrete (the chill, the bead’s weight, the hum in his bones). Contradictory impulses are present but lightly sketched, with minimal degradation under stress. The closing acceptance feels earned, with the visible cost of losing Elara’s presence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is crisp and embodied—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—and her actions align with that drive. The sleepwalking inheritance and tactile craft choices (net, kelp‑twine, bone needle) reveal character under pressure. However, internal contradiction is muted; she meets little inner resistance beyond fatigue, which slightly limits depth. The cost registers physically at dawn, but moral ambiguity or competing impulses are light.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—to restore belonging—drives every micro‑choice, from respectful handling of bones to crafting a gnomon. Her internal tension between fear of disturbing the peace and thrill at beauty gives her texture. The final reconfiguration (finding the genealogy) is earned by prior patience and reverence. Slightly soft on visible, immediate cost beyond labor and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kael’s vocation and motive (“to discover meaning in the margins”) are specific and drive concrete actions under time pressure. Interiority is embodied (the cool weight of the clipboard; the itch for paper/ink) and we see frustration pivot into insight. The contradictory pull—craft pragmatism versus reverence for analog ephemera—surfaces credibly. The cost is modest (time/mission failure risk), but the final naming and mailing feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives and competencies are distinct and drive action—she trusts her tapestry over sanctioned observation and chooses the Western Gate strategy. Interiority is present but mostly declarative; fear and resolve surface without much contradictory pull beyond a brief hesitation. The beggar’s-shawl disguise clarifies values and risk. The arc lands, though the cost to her personally remains lightly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is precise and compelling—seeking the charged instant before choice—and her pride versus yearning to apologize generates credible internal friction. Embodied emotion (moon‑healed scars, silt between toes) grounds the lyricism. Her micro‑choices (relinquishing letters, using the shard) align with her flaws and needs. The cost is felt but remains quiet; no second character on page limits crucible intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s compulsion to translate pain into language is clear and embodied, even as anesthesia and injury resist her—contradictory impulses enacted, not told. Micro‑choices (asking permission, using the coral, inferring from smudges) reveal values under pressure. The nurse and boy modulate status gently, with Elara ceding and gaining ground credibly. The cost—exhaustion and re‑exposure to trauma—lands without tidy heroics.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation (to recover joy) is clear and embodied through specific choices: repurposing ruined negatives and building a light‑installation around the fresco. The apricot memory anchors interiority with sensory specificity, avoiding label‑speak. A small convenience is the “knowledge network” that instantly grants communal memories, but it feeds her tactics and doesn’t undercut credibility. The final shift—accepting ephemerality as part of seeing—feels earned by her prior despair and work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s craft‑rooted interiority is specific and motivating; her credo “exchange certainty for curiosity” informs tactile choices (placing the nickel, completing the fracture). The embodied reactions under pressure (stumbling back; the careful tap) feel earned. Internal contradiction is mild—risk to her professional ethos is implied more than dramatized—so cost reads present but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lysander’s motive—guarding his “spark of defiance”—is clear and consistently drives choice, culminating in the costly decision to ruin his own code and accept arrest. Interiority is textured through concrete embodiment (sweaty palm, chlorophyll-stained hands) and a credible tactical mind under pressure. The charming rogue aspect interacts well with the new austerity of silence. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized moment-to-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is specific and embodied—“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”—and her micro‑choices (seeking the alcove, laying out the postcard, enduring the “exquisite wrenching”) align under pressure. The compulsion reads as a credible flaw that both drives and costs her. Internal contradiction (anguish vs. generative act) is active in scene rather than summarized. The exhaustion at the end feels like an earned price, not a tidy cure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and pressured: preserve the names before the chime fails. We see a credible internal tension—despair versus persistence—resolved through the risky choice to hum when the tool fails. Micro‑choices (the “one last cataloging,” the hum, the night‑long effort) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The cost—accepting finality while working herself to exhaustion—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (decode the Lament to restore trust) is clear and consistent, and her embodied focus—dust, quill, hum in her bones—feels particular. The “carefully reckless” impulse is dramatized in her method rather than just stated. Internal contradiction is mild; the piece favors conviction over friction, so the relational cost stays mostly off‑page. Still, her final decision to go to her peers reads earned by the scene’s lived struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: duty to the city vs. tenderness for the mountain culminates in a third‑path choice. The embodied detail (“slyly heartfelt efficiency”) grounds her competence without sanctifying it. Her micro‑choices (listening with the chain, decoding the residue, rerouting the network) reveal a coherent value hierarchy. A slight idealization of skill under pressure keeps this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—self‑protective isolation vs. a compulsion to follow “paper trails”—are dramatized in concrete micro‑choices (inserting the data chip, contacting strangers, hand‑carrying the parcel). Her professional precision (weights, timing, pigeons) convincingly informs her tactics. The final act (going to the post office, eye contact) reads as an earned renunciation of safety with visible cost. A slight softness remains around the depth of the initial betrayal, but the on‑page arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—find Leo—remains clear and compels her micro-choices (taking the logbook, stepping onto the terrace, reading the grain). The “featherly” resolve hardening into steel gives a credible internal progression under pressure. Some conflict is smoothed—she deciphers the system quickly—limiting messier contradiction or visible cost. The reunion lands emotionally with a character-specific payoff (“I knew you’d read the grain”).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—finding a “rhythm of belonging”—drives concrete micro‑choices (abandoning the console, seeking the platform, consenting to watch). Panic is embodied (tightened breath, pressure sigh, fixation on the feather) and resolves through attention rather than a neat rational pivot. The shared silence with Ronan adds relational texture without stealing focus. The final reorientation risks neatness but feels earned by the scene’s sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and particular, and her actions (placing the seed, conjecturing, planting the seedling) align with it. The contradiction of “cheerful gloom” plays credibly through her embodied work. However, pressure on her interior remains gentle—success arrives with minimal friction and little on‑page self‑doubt or error. The final acceptance reads earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eli’s motive—composing from chance rather than seeking applause—drives precise, credible choices, culminating in sacrificing a won game for serendipity. Interiority is lean but specific to his analytical temperament; watching her instead of the board is a strong character tell. The relationship dynamic sharpens as she becomes “the necessary variable,” and her refusal to capture shows responsive agency. Minor limitation: her interiority stays surface-level, reducing relational complexity at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—defying a nostalgia ban by inscribing a forbidden cosmos into her skin—is clear, embodied, and consistent with her “elective exile.” The grief/defiance tension gives her an internal contradiction that resolves credibly in the final act. Micro-choices (timing, tool use, completion of the final star) align with her past as a tide dancer. Cost is mostly pain and risk implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the peak test.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s motive and craft are clear and embodied in tactile actions (stone, lens work), and his choice to return to the atrium arises credibly from his “unease.” The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or a felt sacrifice; his epiphany lands without resistance. Still, his interiority is specific and character‑particular, especially in the lens-as-calling realization. The earned shift is modest but coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (to “translate pain”) is specific and rooted in identity as a scarred firefighter; her micro‑choices—pilgrimage, opening the fragile hinge with care, measured release—align with that core drive. Interiority is embodied (ash texture, wind, burn scar) and contradictory (competence vs. admitted failure). The renunciation at the end—releasing ashes instead of clinging to atonement—feels earned with a visible cost. A faint neatness in self‑framing (“not here to absolve”) edges toward articulation, but the act carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s goal is sharply defined and her micro‑choices (accepting a failed theory, seizing on the drip correlation, accelerating the pattern‑work) align with it. Interiority is specific (“serene upheaval,” “lucidly watchful”) and embodied via tools and space. Internal contradiction is mild—she adapts almost too smoothly—so the felt cost of abandoning her prior model is present but soft. Still, the final renunciation/reframe reads earned by preceding observation and action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular (to hear what walls dream), and her competence in acoustics drives choices. Interiority is grounded in sensory attention rather than labels, and her shift from cartography to stewardship reads earned. The internal contradiction is mild—more devotion than conflict—so the felt cost is mostly conceptual. Still, reactions to the diaries and the final burden reveal character credibly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive is lucid and particular, and her tactics adapt under pressure (calm turns to command via song and light). Interiority is embodied through breath/heartbeat synchronization and a flicker of frustration. The internal contradiction (perceptive calm vs desperate push) is present but subtle. The ending’s renunciatory cost (loss of the heartbeat) credibly reconfigures her stance without requiring a personality overhaul.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive is clear and embodied—bare feet on warm stone, calloused hands—and Kaelen’s mirrored weariness and loss give their bond heft. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: resolve undercut by grief and the “terrifying vulnerability of hope.” Micro‑choices (raising the clipboard, speaking binding words, accepting the flawed peace) align with motive. Slight abstraction in lines like “compound interest of grief” distances feeling a touch from the body under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradiction—a ruthless builder who steals an auk egg to memorialize loss—drives credible, pressured micro‑choices. His interiority is specific (the “impossible warmth,” the dendritic map as veins/river he killed) and embodied. The renunciation reads earned: he abandons the engineered echo for a real relinquishment with cost. Slight softness remains in the exact stakes of leaving the egg versus shattering it, but the conflict lands.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—defy conformity through an awakening of attention—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (plucking threads, descending, harvesting). The interiority is vivid and character‑particular (observer turned actor), but the internal conflict is largely frictionless; fear or reluctance gets only a passing nod. The role as “chaste courtesan” meaningfully informs her stance, yet we don’t see a concrete cost to that identity on the page. The final renunciation feels earned but somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and credible—the calligrapher/pupeteer duality gives her a lived contradiction that pays off in the decision to refuse sensationalism and invite reader complicity. The story stick catalyzes embodied micro‑choices (touching, turning, reading carvings) that reveal values under pressure. The cost of the final stance (risking her publisher’s approval/commercial ease) is present but lightly felt on the page. The epiphany trends neat yet is grounded in prior traits and practice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and character‑specific (esoteric realist honoring overlooked histories), and her micro‑choices under pressure (anchoring silk, levering the thorn) reveal values and calm against dread. The embodied contradiction—performing steadiness while fearing a wing tear—reads true. The only limitation is a light cost profile; her competence mostly carries the day without a deeper personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the sound of forgotten names—is clear and drives concrete choices (reconfiguring the rope, proceeding with the pour). Interiority is specific (“technically gentle,” laying down self‑recrimination) and embodied through craft. Internal conflict is present but light; her forgiveness happens off‑page and faces little in‑scene resistance. The final kneeling reads as earned awe more than a costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, character-specific interior conflict between maintenance protocol and dream-born imperative, with embodied micro-choices (“precisely playful” fingers, peeling vines) under pressure. Motivation intensifies credibly as the storm and failing systems narrow options. The decisive betrayal of the directive to press the seal reads earned and costly. Slight risk of tidy epiphany, but the groundwork via dreams and system decay carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kalanu’s motive (precision over plunder) drives action, and his guilt and “empirical irony” add texture under pressure. His shift from seeking power to accepting wardenship reads earned through his decoding choice. Interiority is specific to a numbers‑driven mind, though contradictory impulses could be embodied more viscerally at the peak. The priestess provides credible pressure and status tension without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s pacifist cunning and Kael’s rigid resentment play distinctly and press against each other credibly. The tactile beat of Kael touching the cylinder reveals interior conflict without over-explaining. Some didactic phrasing (“cellular memory,” stated thesis lines) trims complexity and feels a touch authorial. The final softening reads earned, though the visible cost is mostly internal and modest.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is crystal—recover a runaway dream—and her choices under pressure (shift from capturing to inviting) reveal a credible internal contradiction between control and hospitality. Interiority is concrete and craft‑specific (silvering, sextant use, breath counts) rather than generic. The embodied anchor—breath, heartbeat, cold—keeps emotion felt rather than labeled. The final renunciation of control reads earned and costs her the instrument and her initial stance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and embodied—betrayed craftswoman reorienting toward legacy—and her micro‑choices (fleeing, climbing, grinding, gifting) align with that drive. Interiority is specific (objects as mnemonic anchors) and actions reveal character under pressure. The mother‑daughter dynamic lands in the closing exchange, though internal contradiction is relatively mild and some statements verge on tidy. Still, the renunciation of the Guild reads earned with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong, specific interiority with credible contradictory impulses (terror of predestination vs compulsion to know). Micro-choices register under pressure (withdrawing from the fruit, seeking the “bathroom,” choosing to eat). The bathroom‑spark epiphany is a touch neat but earned by the cosmologist lore. The final acceptance forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (save the traveler/find the library) is clear and her renunciation feels motivated by the future diary’s warning. Interiority is specific (marginalia, scent-language, “researching gaps in herself”) though some self-critique is summarized rather than dramatized. The micro-choices—reading as confession, choosing surrender—credibly foreclose the straight‑hunt path. The time traveler’s presence applies pressure without stealing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to find the “garden of forgotten names” is specific and coherently tied to her fractured identity. Interiority is vivid and embodied (boots scraping, damp logbook) with credible contradictory impulses—yearning for reunion versus suspicion she’s chasing herself. Her realization feels earned through clues (logbook, “passenger of two minds,” the figure at the bow). The final acceptance forecloses the fantasy of an external twin with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s calmly rigorous temperament motivates each micro‑choice, from choosing not to panic to “listening with her fingertips.” Internal contradiction is mild (a composed professional facing the impossible), but it’s present as steadiness vs. awe. Her decisions drive the turn and reflect profession‑rooted values. The visible cost is conceptual—accepting stewardship of dangerous clarity—rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear, urgent motivation (“to find the quiet in the storm”) drives precise, tactile choices (whispering into ice, positioning the stone). Embodied anxiety (“hammered repose,” teeth-vibrating hum) grounds her interiority. Contradictory impulses are present but light—control versus desperation—without a sharp internal clash. The transformation to “keeper of equilibrium” is earned but its cost (obsolete maps, depletion) is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline—prove coincidences have meaning—and her actions align (charting, waiting, lifting the prism). Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile retrocognition and the Pavilion’s hum. The internal contradiction is modest (devotion to accident vs. inherited clockwork), with limited on‑page cost beyond relinquishing the “perfect beam.” Strong, but not yet cuttingly conflicted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—sculpting identity through curation—drives concrete actions (measuring shadows, inscribing with the quill) and an internal reckoning when her own recorded voice surfaces. Contradictory impulses (preemptive nostalgia vs. doubt about self-erasure) operate simultaneously. The resolution—accepting keeperhood as identity—feels earned and forecloses a path with a felt cost. Emotions are embodied via the ache at “I wish I had gone with you” and the hush becoming a weight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—she engineers awe to cleanse despair—and her doubt-versus-defiance conflict crests credibly at the lighting of the fuse. Interiority is sensory and embodied (smell of kerosene, tracing “Remember”), not abstract labels. The final choice feels earned by the mosaic’s prompt and her professional ethos. The cost is modest (emotional risk over physical), but legible for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motives and worldview are concrete and drive action (the deflection into the grotto), and Aric’s shift from frustration to awe reads earned via the on‑page event. Warm observation inflects her choices rather than remaining label‑only. The reconciliation is a bit tidy given the stakes, with cost largely conceptualized rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s claustrophobia, her rebellion against her father’s world, and her practice of cataloging silences create a credible, specific psyche under pressure. Micro‑choices (shutting her eyes as a “bunker,” then forcing them open, then writing) reveal shifting values. The doll as comfort object turned catalyst exposes a lived contradiction between containment and openness. A slight on‑the‑nose note (“She was not her father's daughter…”) trims nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—“to teach silence how to comfort”—is clear and governs her choices (guiding to the Terrace, when and how she addresses the passenger, presenting the vial). Interiority is restrained but coherent; she reads as competent and purposeful. The passenger’s arc registers, though his interior stakes remain lightly sketched. The main limitation is the absence of real internal contradiction or visible cost to Elara beyond returning to noise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and steady—find the stairway before sunrise—and his actions align with that drive. We get some embodied emotion (“heart a drum”) and a few micro‑choices (scraping layers, stepping through the vortex). Internal contradiction is light; he already “knows” the throne isn’t the goal, so temptation pressure is minimal. The closing renunciation reads earned but the felt cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s purpose-driven severity and Kael’s desperation are sharply etched, with concrete micro-choices (she opens the door without moving it; she increases pressure) revealing character under strain. The teaching-through-suffocation sequence aligns action with motive and exposes her “burns bridges carefully” ethic. Kael’s transformation from clinging to breathing lands credibly with cost. Slightly limited contradiction in Elara’s interiority keeps this shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation—curiosity tempered by past exploitation—drives credible micro‑choices from dismissing the texts as a prank to entering the sub and choosing to anchor. Interiority is specific (heartbeat‑synced glow, breath squeezed), avoiding diagnostic labels. The contradictory impulses (wariness vs. “virtuously mischievous” pull) are present, though the pivot to acceptance is slightly tidy. The final renunciation of profit for wonder lands as earned, with the risk endured as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is clean and character‑specific, and her micro‑choices (plucking the wire, retrieving and winding the handle, closing the ledger) align with it. The internal shift from burdened heir to released “conclusion” feels earned by on‑page discovery. Slight limitation: interior contradiction is muted; she’s steady rather than torn. The change carries a felt cost in renouncing the hunt for fortune and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Alistair’s motive (to “capture the shape of possibility”) is clear, embodied, and tested by the concrete act of unsnapping the clasps. His hesitation at the first clasp and accelerating release show credible internal conflict under pressure. The final inner shift—allegiance to release rather than power—feels earned by the on‑page ritual. Cost is conceptual more than visceral, but the renunciation of the old script reads.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—his “tactfully hopeful diligence” and reverence for dust guide micro‑choices that reveal character under pressure. The contradiction of quiet sorrow versus hope motivates his persistence and careful inference. His final stance—ache endured, purpose reaffirmed—reads as an earned stasis with felt cost. No second on‑page character is needed; relationships appear through artifacts and still force a value choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—guarding memory against sanctioned amnesia—is clear and drives concrete choices (puddle-map decoding, key usage, culvert drop). Interiority is specific (“panic was a luxury she couldn’t afford”) and embodied through tactile perception (cold metal, oily water, filth). The internal tension between safety and visibility crystallizes in her choice to run along the lagoon toward the searchlight. A hair more contradiction under peak stress could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (hushing the crystal’s coded prophecy) is clear and embodied in ritualized action, with a credible spiritual fatigue as cost. Interiority is specific—silence as counterforce, longing for a past without duty—but internal contradiction is modest (duty vs. nostalgia rather than a live dilemma). Micro‑choices (timing breath, modulating volume, embracing rests) fit her identity. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation (to decode the leaves) is clear and seeds a credible internal contradiction—orderly taxonomist compelled into a chaotic act of faith. Embodied moments (dust‑stained fingers, the cry of “mossy delight”) ground emotion. The renunciation of her identity as “orderly” for “sower” lands, though the pivot feels swift and lightly resisted. A touch more friction at the decision would deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are coherent (from mender of clocks to planner of seeds) and her micro‑choices—abandoning tools, trusting “pattern,” descending—track cleanly. The “uncertainly certain” contradiction is present but could be pressure‑tested more; she rarely hesitates or pays a personal cost beyond leaving her bench. Embodied touches (ash‑parched skin, mist) keep emotion grounded. The closing stance shift reads earned, though the pain of renunciation remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (to understand and redeem) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: building the fire, ritualizing the coin, and deciding to tell the village. Interiority is specific and embodied (wet ash, cold iron, the tear) rather than labeled. The contradiction between prudence/inaction and daring/faith gives her arc texture. The epiphany comes a bit easily via the vision, softening visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive (liberate a sorrowing soul by seeding laughter) is clear and drives precise micro‑choices (enhancing, not correcting, the misaligned note). Interiority is specific enough—“fear was just another frequency”—to feel character‑particular. The internal contradiction is mild (compassion vs. instrumental dissonance) and could show sharper cost. Still, actions align with motives and produce an earned, if gentle, change.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Embodied pain and micro‑choices (tearing the strap, forcing each step) render Kael specific and credible. Motivation crystallizes from endurance to absolution without feeling arbitrary. One slip: “This was a trauma response” edges into label‑speak, briefly flattening interiority. The renunciatory drop of the strap reads earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive (“translator of things unseen,” “to honor overlooked histories”) drive choices across the scene. Micro‑choices—bartering a story, following the pull, aiming at anguish—align with that ethic. Internal tension (adrift intuition vs. compulsion to release the story) is present but mild; pressure never fractures her certainty. The ending’s identity shift to “keeper of their light” feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Leo’s motive and competence are crisp—his observant habit and duty to “read” the unresolved drive every choice. Interiority is restrained but present in the “weightless burden” frame and the quiet “Show me.” The ghost works as a pressure presence, though Leo faces little internal contradiction or struggle, keeping the arc elegant but low‑friction. The final act feels earned, if emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear motive (“compress eternity into a single, tangible moment”) and embodied stakes drive Elara’s choice to rupture the vial. Interiority is vivid (“heart a frantic drum”) but internal contradiction is modest; she moves from cool obsession to awe with little friction. The micro‑choice of using the press is credible and aligned with her craft. The ending’s change (becoming the moment) is earned, with the visible cost of undoing the library’s perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and coherent—she wants to reframe a civilization and prove empathy over conquest—and her micro-choices (covering mirrors, choosing to “listen,” composing a eulogy) reveal a credible evolution from fighter to mourner-scholar. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile actions with the shard and the ritual. The internal contradiction (defunct revolutionary vs. poet-archaeologist) is present if a touch tidy by the end. The final stance feels earned, though the cost registers more as reframed identity than a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s purpose and constraint (keeper of the covenant who wilts near lies) drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The embodied cost—nausea, knees buckling—keeps her from reading as invincible. Internal contradiction exists (duty vs. physical revulsion), though it’s sketched more than deeply argued. The ending shows earned endurance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive is clear and consistent, and his occupational specificity colors perception and choices. The renunciation—choosing not to fill a jar—lands as a credible, earned change. Internal contradiction is light; he proceeds with steady assurance rather than contested impulses, which trims tension. Still, embodied moments (cold water to the chest, the humming compass) ground his inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motives track cleanly from survival to awe to a purpose shift catalyzed by the lantern slide. Embodied stress (white knuckles, groaning stone) grounds her interiority. The epiphany is earned by the vision, though internal contradiction is modest (she pivots decisively rather than wrestling with competing impulses). Visible cost appears in the renunciation of her prior work and the all‑night labor.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (hours of study, prying up the stone) align with her motive. Interiority is textured through sensory noticing rather than labels. The internal contradiction is mild—more longing than conflicted compulsion—so the final shift reads earned but gentle. Stakes are primarily existential/intellectual, which keeps cost subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s scholarly drive is clear and continuous, with embodied emotion (“smoke in his lungs”) and credible micro‑choices under pressure (opting to parley via debris). Internal contradiction is present but subtle: reverence for history against the hazard of being psychically snared. The sentinel operates as externalized trauma rather than a character, keeping focus on Elias’s interior movement. A touch more on his fear versus compulsion at the lagoon edge could deepen his contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—transmuting loss into a lasting resonance—reads clear, specific, and consistent with her exile and craft. The interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with tools and place, not therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is modest (grief vs. rejection of “false comfort”), leaving little on‑page ambivalence at peak stress. The final choice (memory over new life) carries a credible cost but is emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s vocation and ethics are vividly rendered, and her core conflict—duty to preserve versus duty to protect—intensifies credibly under pressure. Contradictory impulses are simultaneous on the page, especially as she recognizes the recording’s power yet chooses to destroy it. Embodied perception (sound felt in teeth, scent of orange blossoms) grounds her interiority. The renunciation reads earned with visible cost to identity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular, and her micro‑choices (the acorn orbit, the “inviting chaos back into order”) align with that motive. The piece favors competence and ritual over friction, so internal contradiction is subdued, yielding limited strain or error under pressure. Embodied emotion appears through tactile details (frosting hair, warmth in the cap), though the serenity borders on one‑note. The final acceptance—valuing time by grain rather than length—feels earned but relatively low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are clear and character‑particular—her preference for listening over noise is embodied in her sensory acuity and craft competence. The lever failure forces micro‑choices (jury‑rigging, waiting for glue, weighing duty vs. hush) that reveal simultaneous contradictory impulses. The refusal at zero hour reads as an earned renunciation with a palpable emotional cost. A minor quibble: her competence and calm slightly blunt felt struggle under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interiority is concrete and particular—his ritual with the shard, the broom dropped, the breathless recoil—anchoring motive and change. The stillness/motion contradiction is embodied in his empathic jolt and aftermath. The decision to return nightly reconfigures his purpose credibly. A touch of tidy articulation (“To find strength in vulnerability…”) trims some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motive—preserving “unspoken words”—is clear and consistent, and his agency (studying, interpreting, then placing the box) aligns with his temperament. Interiority is particular and embodied through attention and silence, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping the arc relatively gentle. The final renunciation of speech for intent reads earned but carries a modest felt cost. Absence of a dynamic relationship limits crucible pressure, but within scope it works.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—grasping the “texture of time” under a death sentence—is clear and consistently drives her choices (cataloging, coded sales). The interiority is specific (emerald silo, labored breathing) and avoids therapy‑speak. Internal tension (counting days vs. seeking continuity) is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in a pressured moment. The final renaming of her role feels earned, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—seeking beauty in the incomplete—drives each micro‑choice from the approach to the drake to the decision to write about the feather, not the whole creature. Her embodied attentiveness (boots imprinting mirrors, the humming) reads particular and coherent. Internal contradiction is light; she never truly wavers between competing values, which softens the felt cost. Still, the rescue moment credibly tests her mode without breaking her poise.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and consistent, and her methodical choices under pressure (wiring each tree, forging the circlet, sustaining the link) reveal character through action. The embodied cost—exhaustion unto death—lands credibly. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little resistance and displays few competing impulses. The absence of an on‑page interpersonal crucible limits added dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s skepticism and academic rebellion are integrated into motive and method, producing credible micro‑choices under pressure (following the footprints; testing each artifact via the amber lens). The interiority is specific and embodied (“metallic scent,” “bronze quiet”), and her shift from rebellion to “convergence” reads earned. Cost is present but soft—she relinquishes the shield of doubt without much resistance on the page. A touch more friction in the selection moment would deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s motive (seed‑sowing as penance/hope) is clear and credibly complicated by the fledgling’s emergency, forcing a values trade‑off. Interiority is specific (dead languages, bird calls) and embodied through tactile choices (water in hat, sacrificing grubs and seeds). The renunciation/repricing—broadening his mission from soil to creatures—feels earned. Slight tidiness in the final calm may shave some ambiguity of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motive is clear and particular, filtered through a bloodhound’s sensory logic, and his actions consistently pursue it. Interiority stays embodied (“vibrations transmitted through the floor and into his bones”) rather than abstract. The arc is mostly single‑impulse with limited internal contradiction, softening the felt cost. Still, the final renaming (“a good boy”) lands as an earned reconfiguration of identity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific—transmuting confusion into exploration—and her micro‑choices (opening the folio, seizing on the lodestar glimpse, reinterpreting the streaks) track that drive. The interiority is embodied through tactile details (charcoal, vac‑suit sleeve, tarnished compass). The internal conflict—clinging to inherited order vs. embracing a new process—plays on the page and culminates in a credible renunciation of a fixed “true north.” The cost is mostly conceptual rather than situational, but it’s felt in her solitude and the relinquishment of an older certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives (commission vs. appetite for wonder) are clear and play against each other in scene, with embodied beats like “heart a drum.” Her renunciation of the client’s plan is earned through the apprentice’s pressure and her own values. The cost (forgoing a fortune) is felt though lightly rendered. The apprentice has a distinct presence that reframes Elara’s self‑concept without stealing POV depth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive is precise and embodied in her walking-language; she refuses to stop despite credible risk, and her micro-choices (touching the empty squares, placing a pawn, resuming the pattern) reveal values under pressure. Kael’s backstory is compact yet potent, and his decisive act (returning the pawns) aligns with “benevolently ruthless.” Internal contradiction is limited—Elara is unwavering—so the arc is more endurance than transformation. The relationship reads with clear status and mutual recognition without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation (to understand “the shape of home”) and her avoidance ritual create a credible, contradictory engine that tightens as the stone resists erasure. Concrete micro-choices—the descent, the impulsive touch of the feather, the second touch of the stone—reveal her hierarchy of values under pain. The final renunciation of her nightly substitution reads earned and costly. Minor abstraction in phrasing occasionally distances embodiment, but not at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motivation (self-forgiveness) is specific and drives concrete, escalating choices—from compulsive fidgeting to disciplined decoding to a humble, decisive press. Interiority is embodied via tactile details (stone warmth, cold platinum), and the shift from fidgeting to investigation registers as earned. The renunciation of pride at the end carries a visible cost scaled to the piece. Slight neatness in emotional resolution prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive—splitting a single truth into many—is clear and embodied through the crystal-poetry act under communal pressure. His internal texture (defiance threaded with dread and later sorrow) reads credible, though contradictions in-the-moment are modest rather than richly layered. Micro‑choices are evident (stepping to the plate, lifting the prism, choosing a poem of the “forgotten”). The final cost—losing his voice—lands as an earned renunciation rather than a convenient martyrdom.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to conjure meaning from oblivion—drives tangible micro‑choices under mounting pressure, culminating in the final press of the charm. Her uncertainty complicates decisions and bodily stress is rendered (held breath, chest ache) without therapy‑speak. The endurance/renunciation at the end (not saving the world, choosing meaning) feels earned. Slightly narrow emotional range keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—to finally “paint the truly felt”—is seeded by the mirror’s shatter and escalates credibly through the storm and cave discovery. Interiority is specific (nostalgia, aloof intimacy) and embodied (wind, salt, cold stone). The final renunciation—leaving the painted shell—reads as a kept vow with a felt cost. Internal conflict is present though mostly quiet; a sharper on‑page tug between habit and risk could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is crystalline and enacted through concrete micro-choices: cleaning the lens, clutching the cork, choosing to beckon rather than shout. Embodied perception (scent, thin air, fatigue) grounds her inner life without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is mild—she’s steady in her belief—so complexity skews more to poise than friction. The offstage head keeper provides pressure and contrast but doesn’t force a relational choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is distinct and consistent—“to navigate the geography of loss”—and her choice to abandon repair and invent a lunar pendulum is both character‑true and pressured. The gift/torment of the full moon provides a credible internal contradiction that registers in action, not labels. Interiority is concrete and embodied (bronze’s weight, ache of the plains), though her flaws are more thematic than behaviorally messy. A touch more self‑risk or error under stress would deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—seeking psychological safety in a world of enforced truth—is clear and consistently drives her choices. Embodied detail (“boots sinking,” the “schick” of the trowel) anchors her interiority. Her contradictory impulses—yearning for a cure vs. accepting the cost of destroying hope—surface credibly in the cabin and final creek scene. Minor label‑speak (“involuntarily truthful”) edges toward abstraction but remains grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s motive—duty braided with loneliness—feels specific and embodied (the breath, the beam, the careful handling of the flower). His “observing gaps” method reveals character through choice, not summary. The renunciation at the end (relinquishing the boutonnière) reads as an earned cost. Slight neatness in his deductions trims the edge of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives are clear and rooted in loneliness, professional fixation, and a promise; her micro‑choices (go now, follow ants, slot the chip) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The internal conflict—empirical skepticism versus wonder—is dramatized rather than told. Some beats verge on tidy (“She was no longer lonely”) which softens the felt cost. Still, her decisive act reads earned by prior traits and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and sustained: her disenchantment drives the clandestine climb and the plea to “How do I mend it?”. Interiority is lyrical but somewhat generalized; contradictory impulses (duty vs. compulsion) are stated more than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The decisive shift to “Keeper of the Grotto” reads earned, though the sacrifice is largely conceptual rather than paid on-page. The brief exchange with the spirit provides a credible lineage-based pressure that reframes her disenchantment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (save a dying pocket-sun) is clear, embodied, and tested; her pivot from containment to release arises credibly from pressure plus Kael’s nudge. Contradictory impulses—control versus love-guided understanding—are dramatized, not just declared. Micro-choices (choosing the nautilus, humming, tuning) reveal values and competence under strain. The cost—the renunciation of possession/control—lands, though it’s more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are clear and felt: professional compulsion versus existential derailment, envy turning to pity, and a final renunciation of resignation. Embodied moments (the ache of remembered flight, the sore body on waking) keep emotion concrete. The decisive choice to climb forecloses nostalgia at a cost. A slight neatness to the epiphany trims the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—the anosmia refracts through tactile, auditory, and gustatory cues—while her micro‑choices (bringing the screw, accepting Hemlock’s reframe) credibly lead to a reconfigured practice. The tears arrive as a pressure release, not sentimentality. Mr. Hemlock’s presence applies relevant, gentle pressure without stealing agency. The final renunciation (aroma‑led practice) is earned and its cost—continuing without smell—remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and pressured: transform a wound into meaning, even at personal risk. Contradictory impulses—panic vs. disciplined stillness—collide in the breath-held inscription and the decision to repurpose her stress‑crystals rather than suppress them. Embodied sensations (burning lungs, prickling facets) keep emotion lived-in. The earned revaluation of her flaw into a resource lands as a credible, costly change at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motive is specific and consistent, and her choice to attempt an “imperfect miracle” under pressure earns the final Charged Poise. Leo’s brittle reserve and grief apply immediate relational pressure that exposes Elara’s flaw and courage. Interiority is concrete (regret as current, shame as a spike), and actions align to motive. The relationship alters states credibly in the end without tidy forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear, and her tool choice (the dictionary) aligns with her identity. However, she encounters little internal contradiction or doubt; the arbitration reads as assured rather than pressured. Micro-choices exist (pathfinding, how to define), but they aren’t charged with visible cost. The endurance/change at the end is credible yet emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s duty-bound competence and philosophical itch create a credible, specific interiority under pressure. The soft-reset choice is motivated by knowledge and risk, not convenience, and the bodily cues (“wrongness that vibrated in his teeth”) keep emotion embodied. Internal contradiction (tender of order vs. violator of sequence) is present though understated. The final repricing reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—control-as-safety versus the urge to “let go”—is dramatized through her instinct to reach for the panic button and her refusal to use it. The familiar stranger serves as a pressure mirror rather than a crutch, intensifying her conflict without dialogue. The final reconfiguration feels earned by prior patterning (her lattice vs. his flow). Slight softness remains because the decisive external act belongs to him, marginalizing her embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (responsible widening of perspective) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—following clues despite irritation, lighting then extinguishing the lantern. Her interior contradiction (order vs. her father’s chaos) is embodied and specific, not generic. The final stance shift feels earned and carries emotional cost. Slight on‑the‑nose phrasing (“failed mystic of mathematics”) modestly flattens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and his key choice—letting the loop speak—aligns with his creed. Interiority is economical yet distinct, with embodied ritual (moistened finger on the disc) revealing character. Internal contradiction is light; he reads more as a steady priest of endings than a conflicted man. The absence of a personal cost beyond solitude slightly limits depth, but the restraint suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive and temperament (“gently thorough,” devoted to preserving small moments) drive concrete choices—the steeping ritual, attention to hue shifts, and acceptance of cost. Interiority balances awe and dread without therapy‑speak, giving a credible contradictory state (“haunted euphoria”). The vision reframes duty and sharpens her agency rather than handing her an answer for free. The final acceptance forecloses a path (mere recorder) with a felt cost (her life as ink).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—desperate jocularity masking loneliness—are dramatized in her banter and the crack when the moon rock appears. Her choice to repurpose the rock and halt her itinerancy reads motivated by that loneliness. The interiority is specific (“two asteroids passing”), though embodied cost remains soft and mostly conceptual. More concrete friction or loss at the pivot would deepen credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—mapping emotion and calibrating an internal compass—is clear and embodied through tactile perception and sonic attention. Interiority is vivid (“her skin drank the forest’s ancient, vibrational language”), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or falters. The final change (reorienting the compass to her heart) is earned by prior pursuit rather than declared. Emotional cost is subtle—more a renunciation of external authority than a felt loss—yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear interiority—guilt, doubt, and habit of pattern-seeking—grounds Aris’s choices, and the pen-object reveals character under pressure. His decisive act (using the pen) plausibly grows from his training and grief for Elara. The internal contradiction “confidently uncertain” is named but not fully dramatized in simultaneous impulses on the page. The ending’s “quiet acceptance” lands, though the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (raising the film-less camera, mapping the breakwater, resolving the speedboat). Interiority is embodied and specific (bassoon pier, cello breakwater, trumpet for loneliness). Internal contradiction is present as “joyful sorrow” and protectiveness, though it doesn’t deepen into a truly fraught trade‑off. The grandfather functions as a shaping presence without stealing agency at the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is concrete and consistent—rescue and reveal rather than destroy—and her internal contradiction (urge to burn vs. new promise of connection) peaks credibly at the final tapestry. Interiority is specific (tools, soot, chemical control) rather than label-speak. Her micro-choices (surgical fire, prying the slab, embedding coordinates) reveal values under pressure. Slight glossing of immediate risk keeps the struggle a touch idealized rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to prove the entangled connection is real—drives every choice, culminating in the drumming ritual. Interiority is embodied and particular (“a pressure…immense and intimate”; “auroral sorrow”). The quiet rebellion reads as a consistent trait shaping tactics rather than a label. A minor limitation: contradictory impulses surface implicitly rather than through a sharp, on‑page clash.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motives and competencies are clear and character‑particular (maps as touchstone, gait recognition as compass). Interiority is economical but present in how she navigates pressure and time. The piece lacks a live internal contradiction under stress; she rarely wavers, so cost feels light. Still, her micro‑choices (avoiding thoroughfares, going vertical, whispering via legacy wiring) align tightly with her values.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivations are clear and embodied: Kael teaches without words; Elian seeks a new language. Elian’s tremor and gradual competence give concrete interior progression, though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched. The relationship is the crucible and shifts credibly with visible cost (fatigue, risk of vulnerability). Depth is strong for length but not searingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motive—to seed “forests of second thoughts”—is clear and drives his unusual choice to stage the town‑wide display. His restraint and precise tenderness (“cradling the rebellion itself”) feel character‑particular and embodied. Internal contradiction is mild but present: a quiet man commits to a public, risky gesture. Leo’s shift reads earned, though the felt cost remains gently implied rather than deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Arden’s motive—yearning for freedom inside compulsory peace—is clear and escalates credibly to the renunciatory choice. Interiority is specific (dock grace, black sand, bone’s heat) and the cost is felt when he releases name and history. A slight convenience appears in his sudden “knowing” about the island’s rules, but the emotional logic holds. Contradictory impulses (safety vs. wild nature) are active through the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation and interior contradiction are clear and embodied: he performs mandated neutrality while privately tending grief. Micro‑choices (the flat narration, choosing not to narrate the outdoor ritual) reveal values under pressure. The tear and the decision to risk a private memorial earn the final stance. Minor label use (“morally ambiguous”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is crisp and embodied—reclaim voice by dissolving boundaries—and her choices (palming the quartz, choosing paraphrase over defiance, leaving the page) align. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (textures, hum as information) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is quieter—ambivalence between selfhood and merging exists but never fully bites—so pressure feels more devotional than torn. The final renunciation of a victory poem reads as a credible, earned stance with a subtle cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elian’s motive—seeking beauty in imperfection despite a grey world—is specific and drives his choices; his “innocently cunning” steering of the conversation feels character‑true. Interiority is present through how he perceives texture and light rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are modest; he achieves his aim without a visible sacrifice beyond the bartered leaf. Kaela’s counter‑stance sharpens him, but pressure on their bond remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—recovering connection in a newly silent world—is clear, and her renunciation of bell‑ringing identity reads as a credible cost. Interiority is specific (wire cylinders, resonant crystals, the heft of the lens) and grounded in action. The turn arrives quickly once the lens reframes her approach, so internal contradiction has limited friction before resolution. Still, her choices align with motives and reveal a distinct, disciplined temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s grief and paralysis are concretely embodied (dust motes, still hands), and her motive—to reengage with making—emerges credibly through the cranes and Lyra’s challenge. The internal shift is swift and a touch tidy, with limited on‑page contradiction or hesitation once she reaches the observatory. Micro‑choices (following coordinates, choosing to etch) align with character and reveal values. The cost—relinquishing her prior preservation‑of‑death stance—is felt but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and inherited duty are clear and consistent, driving each choice from measuring to prying up the floorboard. Interiority is specific to her craft, filtered through tools and pattern-thinking. The change at the end (from analyst to keeper/activator) lands but the cost is largely conceptual, with limited on‑page ambivalence or contradiction. The Leo beat adds validation rather than pressure on her flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear and sustained, and her tactics (pattern avoidance) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“atoms of nostalgia” cutting like glass), with credible contradictory pulls (longing to move forward vs. stepping sideways; joy curdling to grief). The veil’s failure tightens her dilemma and exposes limits, and the ending registers a believable before/after in her stance. The epiphany edges declarative but feels earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve the “shape of hope”—is clear and consistently embodied through her tactile habits (the river stone) and her scholar’s patience. Her refusal to borrow a dream and the draining exertion to build her own show credible agency under pressure. The interiority is particular and not generic; however, internal contradiction could be sharpened (her comfort in curation vs. risk in creation is implied more than dramatized). The cost is felt but not deeply conflictual beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s conflicting impulses—anger and compassion—are dramatized in scene and funneled into a concrete micro‑choice: repairing Pascal’s tail. Her interiority is specific (adhesive mixing, single‑hair brush), and her guilt reads embodied through careful, penitent action. A slight tilt toward explicit self‑theorizing (“true healing happens by shedding layers”) softens rawness but doesn’t derail credibility. The final stance—quiet repair as self‑respect—feels earned with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation—closure seeker drawn to wounds—drives each beat from the basil’s “scream” to the tunnel and the final choice to press scars to the orb. Interiority is embodied (throbbing graft, coffee-ring compulsion) and character-specific. The internal contradiction (seeking peace by touching pain) is present if understated. The final act feels earned, though the on-page personal cost remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive is precise and consistent, and her patience, tactile ritual, and final delivery align with that drive. Internal contradiction is light, but the embodied process (waiting, touching sprocket holes) gives her interiority texture. The elderly client’s presence at the end adds relational charge without dialogue. The change—shifting from locating a place to delivering a message—feels earned if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s goal (free her trapped creativity) is clear, embodied, and pressurized by fatigue and fear of missing the moment. Her contradictory impulses—rest vs vigilance—are dramatized, not merely stated. The decisive change (embracing stillness as method) is earned by the aurora/archway vision triggered by her action with the sextant. The cost—foreclosing the chase and surrendering to a new stance—is felt, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s conflict between conditioning/protocol and the rekindled “spark” is clear and dramatized through micro‑choices (stopping, disembarking, touching the box). Interiority is particular (the “migraine made cosmos,” eyes watering at impossible geometries) and ties to action. The final renunciation—remaining as custodian—reads as earned, though the felt cost is framed more as exaltation than loss. A touch more embodied ambivalence at the end would deepen the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation and fear-driven curiosity are clear, and her final choice to abandon the body is credibly earned by the hum-guided approach to the temple. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“metallic pollen,” aching joints), with a real ambivalence (malfunction vs. pilgrimage). The cost—leaving the physical world she has come to love—is legible. Some insights are stated a touch abstractly, trimming the sense of contradictory impulses in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elias’s fear and depletion meet a credible, embodied endurance arc; his micro‑choices (accepting the toll, boarding, then climbing) align with the grief‑hollowed state established. The guides’ reminder reframes agency without rescuing him, keeping motivation internal. A touch of generalized phrasing (“grief he could no longer name”) softens specificity, but the star’s tactile function grounds emotion. The change—choosing to climb and locating resolve—lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s curiosity and need “to understand the cost of safety” motivate clear, coherent choices (following Leo, reading the journal) and lead to a believable inner turn. Interiority is specific (blurred vision, recycled warmth) but largely unconflicted; we don’t see competing impulses push back in-scene. Leo’s pressure on her is gentle but effective, giving a credible relational crucible. The final stance—remain but not be silent—feels earned, though the on-page cost is implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her scholar-warrior temperament reads specific and coherent. Micro‑choices (selecting the folio, activating the pellet, focusing on “the idea of the pretender”) align with her values. However, internal conflict is minimal; she proceeds with near-total composure and competence, limiting felt risk. The endurance cost is gestured at (spent rune, ongoing quest) but not psychologically pressed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving credibly from investigation to testament. Interiority is specific (tapping, mildew atlas, reef memory) and embodied without therapy-speak. The internal conflict—monotony and anxiety versus duty and witness—threads the beats. The final renunciation (keeper of the ledger) carries a felt cost without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive and embodied presence (bare feet on permacrete, the ritual with opera glasses) feel particular and consistent. The shift from “awkwardly confident” to surety inside the stones reads earned by the catalyst, not convenience. However, the instantaneous “She understood” skirts epiphany-lite and the personal cost is faint. The crowd’s presence does not meaningfully pressure her, keeping the crucible mostly internal.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—preserving and evolving tradition against official erasure—is clear and embodied in her tactile choices with the kite, the water, and the amber. The insurgent grandmother angle reads specific and credible, with sensory‑anchored interiority (plant songs, hums, warmth). Internal contradiction is present but mild—fear of the council versus compulsion to act—so the psychological cost doesn’t cut as deeply as it could. Still, her final tending stance earns the quiet shift.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with specific somatic markers and a credible freeze response that opposes the impulse to run. Her realism/optimism tension drives the final stance without sentimentality. Micro‑choices (grasping bark, reframing the photograph) reveal values under pressure. No safety‑hedging or tidy cure; the cost persists.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motive—refusing escape and choosing to “descend into necessary darkness”—is clear and enacted through micro‑choices (not repairing but redesigning; mismatching halves). Her interiority is embodied via the walls’ constriction and the tactile work with cards. The final stance (accepting mosaic selfhood) feels earned by prior action. Slight neatness in the closing insight shaves a touch of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s obsession is concrete (the ink experiment) and her “serene anger” gives her interiority specificity and tension. Micro-choices—spending the last vial, releasing the drop, abandoning the drone—align with motive and reveal cost. The contradiction between wildness and analytic rigor enriches her, though the insight skirts on-the-nose. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty to destroy the letter versus an urgent need to know and act—are embodied in tactile choices (gloved fingers, the snap of the seal, the maintenance panel). Her motivations are consistent with her role and escalate credibly to the risky dissemination. The final renunciation of reporting her find carries visible cost: betrayal of her oath and exposure to regime reprisal. Interiority remains concrete and particular without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s pacifist ethic, rooted against her bounty‑hunter father’s legacy, motivates concrete choices: she stands her ground, instructs “You must sheathe that,” and offers the rose. Her embodied fear (“senselessly perceptive dread”) coexists with calm action, showing credible contradiction. The soldier reads as a human pressure rather than a prop, though his interiority stays thin by design. The final gift of the rose enacts her values rather than declaring them, earning the endurance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is clear and particular—catch the goddess’s echo—and his cool-headedness translates into specific tactics under pressure. Interiority is restrained but embodied (“felt it in his teeth”; resisting the “feral lullaby”). Internal contradiction is present but mild: he feels the pull of loneliness yet holds silence; deeper ambivalence or cost could heighten complexity. The final endurance choice feels earned by prior composure rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—the rosewood nib and telescope refract her conflict between preservation and discovery. The proof‑by‑contradiction choice credibly fractures her identity and drives concrete action. The final confession carries visible cost by foreclosing the family’s curated myth. Minor abstraction creeps in at times, but her motives stay legible and pressure‑responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear, consistent, and scales into concrete choices (modifying equipment, rerouting the cry into amber). Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“meteor hush,” “laboratory of lost sounds”) without therapy-speak. The internal contradiction—preserving loss while needing to imprison a sound—registers, though the struggle is more lyrical than dramatized blow-by-blow. A touch more embodied hesitation in the climax could deepen visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (to find meaning and defuse tension) is clear and her choices (building the mandala, tapping the tile) align with being socially perceptive. Interiority is conveyed via tactile attention to sand and sound, but internal contradiction and visible cost are mild. The strangers function more as pressure than characters, yet they credibly force her nonverbal intervention. The ending shows earned endurance rather than a risky trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound pacifier vs. “gentle radical”—are embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, offering the tessera, renaming). The retrocognition reorients her motives credibly without turning into a tidy epiphany. Status dynamics with the lieutenant are legible, and her defiance carries implied risk. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than concretely paid on the page, slightly softening the turn’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s longing “to be perceived” and Leo’s grief-driven pull are clear and embodied through the synesthetic exchanges. Elara’s micro-choices (spending herself, revealing the rigging failure) and Leo’s choice to anchor rather than seize the coin feel motivated and character-specific. Contradictory impulses are present but subtle (her desire for encore vs. release), leaving a slight neatness at the end. Still, actions align tightly with motives and earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s “affectionate skeptic” stance motivates the central risk (taking the pill) and the embodied making that follows; her loneliness and artistic rigor feel particular. Internal contradiction (skepticism vs. surrender) is dramatized rather than told. The cost—lowering her rational guard to be guided by somatic memory—is felt but modest. Strong, specific reactions to objects (doorframe shock, geode, LED) reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, and her choices (entering the fissure, retuning the device, opening herself as conduit) align with that motive. Interiority is concrete and sensorial rather than label‑only. However, internal contradiction is minimal; the piece skews toward competence over struggle, so the change from cartographer to chronicler carries modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and sustained, and her choices (cataloging, releasing the echo, flipping the hourglass) align with it. Interiority is conveyed through tactile ritual rather than abstract labels. However, contradictory impulses are minimal—her certainty blunts ambiguity—and the cost to her is more conceptual than personally felt. The arc earns endurance and resolve but stops short of exposing a sharper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives (recover honor, test herself) drive concrete micro‑choices, from measured steps on the cornice to the final decision to stand her ground. Interiority is textured and embodied (numb fingers, scarfed face) with a credible push‑pull between the urge to flee and the resolve to show the pillbox. Her acceptance of cost—risking being shot or arrested—feels earned by what precedes it. Minor safety in phrasing (“prudently daring” as a label) is outweighed by on‑page enactment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s ethos—listening, distilling, enduring—drives the wait, the inference about the vow, and the final relinquishment; Linnea’s motive is clear and active in the spine-prying beat. Interiority is present but restrained; we don’t feel much contradictory pressure in Linnea before she yields the hidden text. Actions align cleanly with traits, but the ease of the realization slightly flattens struggle. The relationship dynamic (steady guide/uncertain seeker) is effective and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aris’s quiet drive and tactile attention ground him; his renunciation (stopping the hive form to “shape the memory itself”) is a credible, character‑true pivot. Interiority stays embodied (“a sharp gentleness,” thrum up his arms). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatic, but the restraint fits his zen mind. The emotional cost is gentle yet present: he accepts a truth larger than craft and changes his aim.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive—turning loss and darkness into light—is precise and drives each micro‑choice. Her “wistful pragmatism” creates credible internal contradiction: grieving the rose while making room for basil and invention. Handling the inherited gauge, she repurposes legacy and skill into creation, revealing character through action. The final stance accepts the ache while reconfiguring it, with a visible cost (the rose’s absence) honored rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyra’s motive—translating isolation into independence—tracks cleanly and sharpens under pressure, with the “isolation as shield → cage” line showing contradiction. Her brittle awakening grounds fragility without melodrama. The final decision to launch is earned, though the on‑page cost of leaving the archive could be articulated one notch more. Embodied details (scales, three‑fingered hand) help keep her interiority particular.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied, with a clear through‑line from ghostwriter detachment to risking exposure. The nest discovery convincingly catalyzes her shift. Internal conflict (keeper of secrets vs. desire to connect) is present, though friction could tighten under pressure. The final renunciation of anonymity reads earned, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—cautious hope sharpened into a defensive gambit—is clear and consistent, with embodied detail (grease-smudged hands, stinging eyes). We get a credible internal tension (hope vs. fear of bait), though contradictory impulses don’t visibly clash under peak pressure. Competence slightly outweighs struggle; the solution lands without meaningful self-doubt or error on the page. The closing endurance (fatigue, solitary burden) reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—prudence versus rebellious reach—are dramatized in the moment she touches the compass despite fear. Embodied interiority (“a frantic bird in a stone cage”) feels character‑specific and carries through to a steely focus under pressure. The shift from claustrophobia to functional courage is earned by scene causality. The only soft spot is the ease of emotional resolution once the mechanism responds.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s prosopagnosia and ritualized method create a distinct interior life, and the stated desire to awaken empathy is paid off with a concrete emotional shift at the end. Contradictory impulses—clinical distance versus yearning to feel—operate concurrently in scene. Actions (drawing, deducing, deciding to go to police) align with motive. Minor weakness: the deduction speed compresses struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear and compelling, and her “nervously confident” contradiction is embodied in trembling hands matched with steady resolve. Micro-choices (digging, apologizing, gripping the nail, speaking the declaration) align with character. The cost is felt in desecrating a grave and risking failure, though her flaws remain gentle and untested by serious counterpressure. Overall strong interiority without safety‑hedging, if not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmute not‑knowing into an image—clarifies credibly and drives her micro‑choices, especially the turn from the ruined plate to photographing the fiddler. Interiority is concrete and profession‑specific, with tactile handling of the antique camera and a perceptual bias that feels lived. The acceptance cost—letting go of solving the hitchhiker—reads as earned rather than pat. A minor softness: emotion tilts lyric at times, risking abstraction, but never loses embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s motives are clear and consistent—seeking to understand and then refuse his father’s cycle—and his choices under pressure (nonviolent dissuasion; renouncing the cache) align with that psychology. Interiority is specific and embodied (melting into the lion’s cage; the tactile handling of notes). A credible endurance/renunciation lands at the end with cost. Minor lack of simultaneous contradictory pull (temptation to keep the cache is implied more than dramatized) keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s goal is clear from the first line and her choices (seeking Alaric, decoding, then using the dream‑lens) align with it. Interiority is present and tactile (the floral telegram against cold stone), though her struggle feels consistently low‑friction and largely competent. The brother relationship is motivating but functions mostly as an off‑page pressure rather than a crucible. The final shift to “chronicler of shared history” is earned but the cost to her is lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s guardedness, guilt, and compulsion to “find lost things” generate credible, contradictory impulses that drive each choice. The shattering of the frozen confession externalizes her flaw with embodied cost, and the final act of integration is earned by prior defects and pressure. Her “warlike serenity” vs. inner failure reads particular rather than generic. Minor neatness in the forgiveness turn keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is vivid and embodied—the compulsion to “find the intersection of dreams” threads every choice, with pain vs. purpose creating credible internal friction. Micro‑choices (pressing the clipping to each wound despite the tearing roots) show values under pressure. The arc from anxious elation to anchored purpose lands with a felt cost. Slight archetypal smoothness (few messy contradictions beyond pain/drive) keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her tactics (quartz, leaf, song) align with her “fiercely gentle” identity. The inner life is present but mostly unwavering; there’s little contradictory impulse beyond pain versus resolve. The final renunciation (offering memories) reads earned by prior choices. A sharper flash of doubt or temptation at the heart would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Leo’s interior is concrete and particular—hands that “wrangled speaker stacks” now tremble; he appraises weave counts to avoid emotion—yielding a credible contradiction. Micro‑choices (opening the box, appraising as insulation, digging out road cases, reading the inscription, choosing to search) trace a motivated turn. The renunciation of his protective detachment carries felt cost and is earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims the top end.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elian’s motives and flaws are clear and consistent—ambition, guilt, and curiosity—and his renunciation is earned by what we see him feel and do. Interiority is concrete (“a physical weight,” “electric tang”), and his “kindly methodical” handling of objects reveals character. The internal contradiction (drive to grasp vs. decision to nurture) is present, though it transitions smoothly rather than in simultaneous push–pull. The final choice forecloses a path with cost: abandoning his decade-long approach in favor of slow growth.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The librarian’s motive—preserving wonder through meticulous cataloging—is clear and animates concrete choices (retrieving, carrying, smelting, shelving). The internal contradiction (order vs. tidal wildness) is dramatized during the smelting, not just stated. Embodied sensation is present (pressure in gears, cool water), though emotional texture could deepen beyond serenity. The endurance choice at the end feels earned, with the basket’s dissolution as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s professional carapace and the slow fissuring of it under the shell’s confessions read credible and embodied (“pounding of his own heart,” trembling hand). The motivation shift is earned by on‑page sensory revelation and Elara’s quiet pressure. The crowning gesture forecloses a path—his role as certifier of isolation—at a believable emotional cost. Elara remains elliptical but purposeful as a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motive and contradictions are clear and embodied: a meticulous cartographer of pain who has stopped medication, risking turbulence to pursue truth. Her micro‑choices—scratching third‑person confessions, publicly adding shame‑coordinates—show costed vulnerability. The shift to playing the accordion feels earned by prior beats rather than epiphany-by-decree. Minor risk of abstraction appears in a few thesis-like sentences but does not undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motivation is clear and specific, and the “cautious exuberance” contradiction is sustained credibly on the page. Interiority is distinct and embodied (veil, light, hum), with a clean desire line. However, the protagonist faces little friction—competence outpaces struggle—so micro-choices under pressure are limited. The final acceptance carries felt weight but at a modest cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a provenance researcher with plant-telepathy torn between a quiet life and a charged ethical act. Embodied emotion (“mulberry ache”) and micro‑choices (eschewing official tools, using coffee, then playing the violin) align under pressure. The cost of renouncing her “quiet dream” is stated more than dramatized, slightly softening the afterburn. Still, the final choice is earned by prior setup and interior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—“to capture one last spark before oblivion”—is clear and consistently embodied in her tactics. Interiority is specific (heartbeat receding, weariness after) and aligned with her vocation. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or visible struggle beyond discipline, keeping the arc slightly one‑note. Still, the final earned stillness/emptiness carries a modest cost that reads.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motivation and embodied craft details ground Elara, and her micro-choices (climbing, investigating, reaching into the tree) align with her caretaker identity. The internal conflict is mainly absence versus seeking, with limited on‑page contradictory impulses. The epiphany is earned through discovery but lands a touch tidy. Still, the renunciation of an endpoint for a life of tending reads credible for her.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear, credible motives: Elara’s hired conscience work vs her covert aim to invite nuance; Kael’s armor of polished courtesy. Micro‑choices (choosing dawn, reading chimes, deploying the mirror) reveal values under pressure. Kael’s shift (“I’ll find another way”) feels earned by on‑page triggers with a felt cost to his plan and self‑image. A touch of label‑speak (“cloak of doubt”) edges toward told psychology but doesn’t undermine the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s frustration-to-awe progression is credible and embodied through the descent and silent observation; Elara’s withholding pedagogy is consistent and motive-driven. Interiority is present but slightly generalized at peak beats (“his frustration gone, replaced by a thrumming awe”) where a more character-specific texture would deepen cost. The relationship dynamic (teacher withholding; student adapting) produces the key turn. The final recognition of Elara’s own vanishing reads earned, if gently priced.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaelen’s vocation and creed drive specific choices—he halts work, reads the birds, retrieves and keeps the arrowhead—showing motive aligned with reverence and patience. The sacrilege twinge when he plucks the arrowhead provides a credible internal ripple. The epiphany (“He was the harmony now”) lands but feels slightly tidy, with limited on‑page contradiction under stress. Emotional embodiment through tactile sensing (pulse through bone, warm arrowhead) is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elian’s motive—valuing the sacred in the simple—drives every beat, and his contradictory impulses (efficient training vs. tactile curiosity) appear on the page. The mist‑walk crystallizes a non‑grand but committed ethic, and his vigil shows embodied cost (cold, time, renunciation). Interiority is concrete and action‑tethered rather than abstract. The final stance—a chosen endurance—reads earned and character‑particular.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s yearning is clear and embodied (the lamplighter routine versus the pull to “discover the color of sound”), and his choices propel the plot. However, internal contradiction is light: he moves from curiosity to acceptance with little resistance or visible cost. The “truth he hid behind” line is more labeled than dramatized in scene. The weeping at the end lands, but the renunciation of the old self could bear a sharper on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s doubt-to-agency progression is clear and motivated by the backwards prophecy and her need to “wavelength align with purpose.” Interiority is specific through the coin and console handling, though some emotions are abstractly labeled. The reversal from observer to composer is earned, with visible struggle (tears, hesitation) preceding the decisive tactic shift. Cost is modest but present in the risk of meaninglessness and the renunciation of passive cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and character‑specific: a reaper compelled to honor and preserve last fears rather than harvest. Interiority is embodied (ache, cold, trembling) and actions align with the new goal. Internal contradiction—duty vs. empathy—registers, though it could sharpen under peak pressure. The final shift from isolation to connection feels earned and paid for emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elian’s motivation and contradictions are clear: lukewarm talent, earnest naivety, and brittle devotion that risks collapse under doubt. His micro‑choices—shifting focus from force to patient control of condensation—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Emotion is embodied in tactile observation and fatigue rather than labels. The final inner shift (from forcing to nurturing) is earned, though the cost reads gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s motive—to turn data into communal meaning—drives concrete, pressured choices: to document, to keep walking, to stop photographing and hold what he finds. Interiority is embodied (mud, rot, the bottle’s blue) and particular (father’s liqueur), with a live contradiction between “expunge” and “bear witness.” The final stance shift feels earned, with a visible cost: accepting the burden of grief and stewardship. Minor safety in the self-articulation (“His purpose was to do the opposite”) keeps it just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s drive is clear and specific, and her interiority—ledger‑mind vs. secretly sentimental heart—shows in concrete reactions to the crystal and the birds. The micro‑turn from despair to attentiveness to action reads earned. The cost is primarily relinquishing control and composure, which lands but feels low‑risk. A slight ease in the epiphany keeps it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—preserving trust—drives every choice, and her panic vs. competence tension is embodied when the broken buckle threatens paralysis. Her adaptation with the vine shows value hierarchy under pressure. The visible cost of expending the only emergency pod credibly forecloses a path. Slightly limited internal contradiction keeps it from a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kaelen’s motive (escape paralysis to become whole) is clear and pressure-tested through concrete micro‑choices: recoiling, holding his ground, then actively welcoming the torrent. The internal contradiction (hollow calm vs. overwhelming feeling) is dramatized rather than summarized. Rin’s pressure functions as a crucible without softening truths. A slight on‑the‑nose tendency in her didactic lines trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s motive—safeguarding spaces for innovation—is clear and drives concrete choices (research, vault, decoy). Interiority is present but leans on summary and concept rather than embodied contradiction; we rarely feel her fear in the body. Her competence borders on frictionless, with little visible self‑doubt under pressure. The final choice reads consistent but not hard‑won by psychic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motive—to restore laughter—is precise and embodied in tactile choices (earmuffs on, yanking the cord, accepting absurdity). “Mournfully eager” plays as a living contradiction that drives him through the macerating ritual. The relationship crucible arrives on‑page when his wife appears and his choice to kill the engine creates space for her laughter. Cost is felt in his willingness to risk ridicule and reopen shared grief.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation (“make friends with uncertainty”) is clear and coherently dramatized through micro‑choices (pausing, open‑hand gesture, throwing the pendant). Interiority is concrete and embodied (cold, mist, hum in the glove), with a credible linkage between her “dimensionally homesick” ache and empathy for the guardian. The final shift from ache to calm feels earned, though the epiphany edges on tidy. The guardian functions as a relational crucible, but conflict between them remains low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to break the ordained loop of failure—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (shift to subtractive method, calibrating destruction). Interiority is specific enough (“stoically sensitive,” resonant sorrow) and embodied via tactile details (obsidian cold, ash, heat). Internal contradiction is modest; she pivots decisively rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The cost is present but mostly conceptual (destroying the crozier, risking annihilation), not deeply personalized beyond grief/hope.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s drive is clean and character‑particular, and her renunciation (throwing the Hollywood shard) credibly earns the ending. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention to equipment and the city’s strain under perigee. The internal contradiction (add more vs. subtract to hear) is present but resolves a bit tidily. Still, the micro‑choices under pressure align with her credo and reveal values with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Leo’s resilient positivity and duty-driven competence are clear and consistent, and his actions (radio call, steering to coordinates, placing/turning the hourglass) align with those traits. Interiority is present but light; we don’t feel much contradictory impulse or genuine doubt under pressure. The “instinctual” understanding skirts convenience and softens struggle. The closing repricing of his role as “keeper of the timeline” lands, but the felt cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and flaw—control through “rational enchantment”—are crisply dramatized, and her micro‑choices (pushing the weave harder, forcing connections) reveal her hierarchy of values. Embodied tells (bead of sweat, “unsettling calm” breaking to awe) ground her inner turn. The final renunciation—“not to weave, but to listen”—is earned by prior pressure and cost. Some moments tip into abstract phrasing rather than lived, contradictory feeling, slightly thinning interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyra’s motivation and temperament are clear and embodied through her reverent curiosity and the way she receives the anchor and the holo‑lattice. The relationship dynamic—mentor’s challenge and student’s stance—adds pressure without melodrama. Internal conflict is subdued but present as awe mixed with trepidation (“It’s a darker sky… but it’s so much larger”). The final stance feels earned, if more conceptual than painful.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation—protecting vulnerable voices—remains clear and consistent, and her curiosity catalyzes the decision to move from easing a passing to exposing a crime. Interiority is specific enough (“a chill and a pull behind the ribs,” filtering out the world) though true contradiction is mild. The micro‑choice to promise justice under time pressure reads earned. The visible cost is more conceptual (accepting duty) than embodied, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and mission to honor the forgotten scientists are clearly embedded in action, and her micro‑choices (ignoring the hum, forcing herself down the ladder, trusting the insane protocol) feel motivated. Embodied stress is convincing under pressure, though “panic clawing at her throat” leans clichéd. The ending shows credible endurance and recommitment rather than a tidy epiphany. Limited contradiction beyond fear vs duty keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motivation is crystal-clear and sustained (fetch wisdom from failure), with embodied, specific interiority (breath, cold fingers, heartbeat metronome). The flaw (arrogance/fear) is dramatized via the ghost’s playback, not told in summary. The final renunciation—stopping the count—feels earned and forecloses a coping strategy with visible cost. Slight neatness to the epiphany tempers peak complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—to preserve a dying language by translating texture into sound—is clear and drives every choice. Her internal conflict between purity and dissonance sharpens at the climax, culminating in the earned decision to weave the curse into the whole. Embodied cues (copper veins glowing, breath pacing to birds) make her interiority concrete. The arc is a credible endurance/renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive—bitterness refocused into a “cosmic joke”—is clear and evolves credibly into awe as the anomalous phenomena intensify. Her micro-choices (answering the prop phone, keeping the arrowhead, choosing not to resist) reveal character under pressure. The contradiction between grievance and wonder is present but resolves a touch swiftly into epiphany. Still, emotion is embodied and particular, with a real cost in relinquishing her human life.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—to reawaken beauty—drives every action, and her embodied attention (bow shift, heart hammer) grounds her interiority. The leap from “knowing” to “understanding” via the locust shell is earned but a touch convenient, with limited depiction of contradictory impulses. There’s minimal flaw-based friction or moral trade-off; the piece privileges purity of intent over complication. Still, micro‑choices in performance tactics reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kael’s motive—mapping hope by “linking absences”—is specific and consistent, and his micro‑choices (halting the drone, demanding a sign before payment) reveal value hierarchy under risk. Interiority is grounded in tactile perception (grit, glass, ledger), not therapy‑speak. The trait “respectfully rebellious” is partly told, but it’s also dramatized in the exchange ritual. Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal, but the cost-bearing trade reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—interpreting silence as possibility and completing lost work—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (stopping, entering, touching, singing, then taking up tools) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely resists or doubts, so pressure doesn’t expose layered impulses. The compulsion to sing is effective but reads more fated than contested. The final choice to begin carving is earned but carries a soft, largely conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s desire “to find the place where stories live” is clear and propulsive, and her sanely eccentric habits color her perceptions and choices. The pull between discovery and duty materializes when the student coughs, creating a credible, character‑driven pivot. Embodied emotion leans lyrical over specific physicality, and internal contradiction could be pushed harder on the page. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in an earned shift of role.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s longing and frustration are clear and embodied, and her decisive act (throwing the gathered light at the dead lens) stems credibly from mounting pressure. Interiority is vivid and particular to her solitary vocation. However, internal contradiction is mild; she rarely contends with competing impulses beyond ache vs. hope, so the final shift carries limited personal cost. The closing acceptance (“It was a key, and she… learned how to read”) is earned but neat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is clean—he frees ideas trapped by fear—and his empathetic method (conversing with the lock/fear) aligns with it. However, interiority is thin; we get little contradiction or embodied doubt under pressure. Competence reads near-frictionless, muting visible struggle and cost. The final gesture (storing the ribbon) suggests history, but the on‑page beat lacks a sharp internal trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her actions align with her hands‑on, compulsive curiosity. Interiority is concrete—diving, photographing, cross‑referencing—though internal contradiction is light, with little on‑page ambivalence beyond urgency. The mother–daughter thread personalizes the quest and earns the final peace. A touch more friction or self‑risk under pressure would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s “combative tenderness” reads specific and actionable; she refuses pity, offers tools, and pushes Kael through a painful beat. Kael’s backward steps are a concrete nervous tic that externalizes his avoidance. The final collaborative annotation feels earned by prior motive and stance. Slight thinness: Kael’s interiority is sketched more by behavior than embodied sensation, softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—preserving the world’s wonder—drives every choice, and her embodied fatigue at the end registers genuine cost. The decisive turn (“not taking, but giving”) reveals character under pressure rather than delivering a tidy epiphany. Internal contradiction is present but mild (fear/despair versus generosity), keeping stakes clear but not deeply ambivalent. Still, action aligns tightly with her craft identity and values.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive (to ground spirits by repurposing the broken) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices with the needle and net. Interiority is largely shown through tactile action rather than explicit thought, which works but limits contradiction in‑scene. The relationship with Kael adds subtle status dynamics without crowding the focus. The acceptance of visible stitches as an ethos is an earned, character‑specific note.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s drive—curiosity tempered by empathy—consistently motivates her tactics (the film study, the precise test of the stone) and culminates in a costly renunciation (not documenting the find). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heart hammered,” the tactile press). The competing impulses—scholarship versus protection—coexist in scene rather than alternating in summary. The final refusal reads earned by what we’ve seen of her values and method.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s “quietly analytic” disposition and hollow reaction to triumph establish a credible motive for helping Mortimer, and her choice to methodically untangle the threads fits her nature. However, internal conflict is mild—she encounters little resistance or risk in executing the release. The relationship dynamic with Mortimer is clear and textured but largely cooperative, limiting pressure. The final reorientation toward Amelia reads earned but emotionally cushioned rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—to give voice to the ghost and, implicitly, recover her own—is clear and embodied through tactile action on the iron plate. Awe and trepidation coexist credibly, but the process reads a bit frictionless, with little on‑page cost or error. Still, her regained note at the end feels earned by the work we witness. More visible struggle or a risky tradeoff would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motive—seeking joy beneath anguish—consistently drives his choices, from examining the goggles to orchestrating the penthouse reveal. Interiority is precise yet restrained, befitting a servant’s trained detachment. The relationship beat with the new resident lands without dialogue, showing status and empathy through action. The main limitation is low visible cost or internal contradiction; Kael rarely struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aris’s motivation to observe and “memorialize” under duress is clear and consistent, and her quick pivot from panic to method reads as trait‑true. The telescope and recorder choices under pressure reveal character credibly. Internal contradiction is mild (survival vs. completion) but present and paid off when rescue becomes secondary. A slight idealization of her calm under mortal risk keeps this just shy of outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas’s motive is clear and particular—mirroring the sky to grasp essence—and it coherently drives every action. Interiority is textured (calm precision shading into rare frustration, then acceptance), with embodied attention to tools and surfaces. The final renunciation (not saving lens or journal) feels earned and carries cost. A touch more contradiction under peak pressure could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motive (prove herself, make a discovery) cleanly drives her choices and aligns with her “diligently curious” nature. Interiority is specific in the way she reads the world’s “languages,” but internal contradiction is light and she meets little resistance. The solution arrives on her first attempt, minimizing struggle and visible cost. The “sociable isolation” note adds texture but doesn’t pressure a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s motive (“to learn the rhythm of repair”) is clear and consistent, and her skills align with her choices (unlocking, assembling). However, there’s minimal on‑page struggle or contradictory impulse; competence glides over friction. Interiority is lyrical but generalized, with little embodied cost beyond wonder and resolve. The closing shift feels earned but emotionally tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s altruism motivates every beat, culminating in a credible, costly sacrifice. Interiority is lyrical but light on contradictory impulses; we seldom see her doubt or selfish reflex complicate tactics. The “brambled” hope image gives texture to feeling without therapy‑speak. Kael functions more as an externalized competency than a pressured character, which limits relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s duty-bound competence meets rekindled maternal love in a credible, embodied way; the puppet’s fall catalyzes her motive shift without feeling contrived. The internal contradiction—technician vs. mother—operates in the moment of choosing to sing rather than force the gears. Emotions are tactile (sweat, warmth of the wood) rather than labeled. Slight neatness in the valorization of love risks tidiness but doesn’t undercut the earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (guiding travelers) is clear and consistent, and her interiority is specific—weariness, duty, and fear coexist. The discovery of the nut credibly reframes her role and pushes her toward a higher‑stakes choice. Internal contradiction could be deepened in the mid‑scene (she moves from caretaker caution to decisive action quickly). Still, actions align with motives, and the final renunciation of her identity as caretaker carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s motivation (atonement and the need to translate separation into connection) is clear and consistently embodied through his chemist’s gaze. Interiority is specific—foam as colloid, grief as “rigid, crystalline”—and his final choice (integration vs. static guilt) feels earned by prior perception. The contradiction between his analytical habit and emotional paralysis is active on the page. The epiphany resolves a bit neatly, but the act of releasing the chrysalis carries credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elias’s drive is clear and particular, and his micro-choices (agreeing to help, how and where he cuts) align with his vocation. The woman’s need frames pressure but her interiority remains thin, so the crucible rests mostly on his method. Conflict within Elias (desire for origin vs. risk of being wrong) is implied more than dramatized. The final recognition feels earned but low-cost emotionally for him.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s vocation and motive are vividly specific, and his choices under pressure (refusing to enter at first, reading the tidal pool, then risking subsumption) align with an embodied ethic. The cost to him—“a new stone in his gut”—lands as an earned endurance. Internal conflict is implied more than dramatized; he largely executes a plan without real doubt or stumble. Elara functions as credible pressure but remains sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (“construct bridges from silos”) is clear and drives concrete choices: volunteering, identifying the missing weight, retrieving it, and recalibrating via song. Interiority is particular—she “hears” systems as choirs and feels a “physical ache.” There’s little internal contradiction or visible personal cost beyond strain, which keeps the arc strong but not piercing. Competence slightly smooths pressure, though the choices remain character‑true.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and interiority are vivid and specific—“chaotically precise” hands, awe braided with fear, and a credible obsession inherited through use rather than claim. She makes concrete micro‑choices (modifying the interface to “allow the flow”), showing adaptive agency. The contradiction (terror vs. compulsion) plays on the page, though costs remain more conceptual than embodied. Strong, if slightly safe, emotional progression without a hard trade‑off beyond altered self.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is crystalline and drives continuous action, with a few embodied beats (stomach lurch, frantic run) under time pressure. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she’s capable and composed, rarely torn—so the arc reads as endurance/competence rather than a conflicted change. The closing duty shift lands but at low emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris’s drive is clear and embodied in tactile choices—reading fissures, stilling his breath, using himself as conduit. The tension between desperation and patience gives him dimension, though his flaw-set is gentle and largely idealized. Micro‑choices under pressure are credible and aligned to motive. The change at the end feels earned even if the personal cost remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (restore the covenant, find “beauty in the difficult”) is clear and consonant with her chess‑honed precision, and her micro‑choices (watching for days; the single, exact adjustment) align. Interiority is specific—worry stone, trained gaze—though her competence rarely meets true internal contradiction under pressure. The exile wound gives felt shading but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off in the peak beat. The bittersweet end registers as change with modest cost rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive and interiority are vivid and particular—cataloging silences, feeling harmonics rather than calculating—yielding embodied choices under pressure. The doubt beat (“Was this alchemy instead of science?”) registers as a real internal conflict that shifts her tactic from force to empathy. Actions align cleanly with motive, and the renunciation at the end (turning from fireworks to read) carries felt cost. Minor safety: she is very competent; a touch more friction or blind‑spot consequence could deepen the change.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive (“to cultivate serenity within motion”) is clear, embodied through her olfactory focus and the corpse flower’s demands, and she evolves from frantic control to reverent acceptance. Contradictory impulses (ambition vs. surrender) operate simultaneously in the doodling beat and the bloom. Micro-choices—choosing to doodle, to wait, to inhale the stench—reveal values and cost. The renunciation of her frantic tactics reads earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation aligns with her values while foreclosing an easy path (exploitation/possession). Interiority is concrete in sensory terms (pressure in ears, hum of thrusters), though internal contradiction could be deepened beyond a single, poised refusal. The micro-choices—how she navigates, where she steps, whether to take the arrow—reveal priorities under time pressure. The choice not to take the artifact carries a credible cost for an “intrepid pilot” defined by discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motive and professional mindset are clear and embodied through his tools and habits, yielding credible, goal-driven choices. The interiority is specific (“woolen quiet,” teeth ache) and filtered through his investigator’s bias. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible emotional cost; he executes with near-frictionless competence. The patch tugs at him, but the tension remains intellectual more than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—transforming beauty from “decorative” to essential—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices. Interiority is particular (synesthetic perception) and emotions are mostly shown through action. However, internal contradiction is light; she proceeds with near‑total conviction and faces little on‑page resistance. The felt cost is present but subtle (she “poured her entire being” and relinquishes exclusivity), limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her choices (preparation, opening the weave, sealing the shadow) align with a keeper’s ethos. Interiority is textured but restrained; contradictory impulses (reverence vs. fear) surface early yet the piece seldom stresses them under peak pressure. She remains highly competent with limited visible struggle, softening cost. The closing renunciation of old arrogance reads earned but a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aris’s motive (quantify emotion) and flaw (borrowing personalities) are crisply dramatized, then stress‑tested by the torrent of transposed empathy. His micro‑choices—choosing deliberate ambiguity, pulling the lever, slamming the release—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (stopping the habit of borrowing) lands as an earned cost. A faint trace of stated insight edges toward summary but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s embodied anxiety (“boots slipped,” “knuckles were white”) and micro‑choices (waiting vs. touching the pendant) reveal character under pressure. The disappointment at the “just a piece of jewelry” beat earns the later revaluation. The final renunciation—becoming a keeper—feels motivated by prior teaching and on‑page discovery. The turn is a touch tidy but lands because it grows from her particular insecurity and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are precise and embodied—anger on the drive, the prism as tactic, the choice to leave it and touch the quartz is a credible pivot. The internal contradiction (proving a thesis vs. surrendering to a larger voice) is dramatized rather than told. The change (“She had been right, but she had been small”) feels earned by the sequence of attention and tactile discovery. Visible cost is her humbled stance and the relinquishing of her instrument as interpretive authority.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s goal and endurance are specific and consistent, and her choice to unmake her masterpiece reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost (collapse, loss of years of work). Interiority is concrete through tactile labor and fatigue rather than labels. Minor shortfall: little contradictory impulse beyond fatigue vs. duty, making her psychology elegant but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation (find Kael without melodrama) is clear and enacted through methodical prep and a calm, risky solution. Interiority is concrete in craft details and controlled breath, though true contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in the peak moment. The choice to refuse the lichen’s bargain and improvise a puppet reads character‑true. The cost is modestly felt—she loses the silk and risks failure—but the stoic register avoids overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to a desperate need, with embodied reactions (the shard’s heat, the frayed mind) grounding her interiority. Her micro‑choices—redirecting focus, persisting through voids—reveal values under pressure. The fleeting second character still applies pressure via regret and confession that reframes her quest. A minor convenience remains in her “instinctive” grasp of method, but it’s earned by the shard’s influence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elvan’s reticence and observational bent are dramatized through concrete choices—reading the letters, parsing the cairns, and relighting the lamp. Internal contradiction is light but present (a man of solitude assuming a public charge). The assumption of duty lands as a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor limitation: emotional texture stays steady rather than compounding under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s interior is vivid and specific—the “shadowed elation,” dread at the involuntary laugh, and craft habits ground him under pressure. His contradictory impulses (to guide with light vs. recognizing salvation through shadow) act simultaneously in the storm. The final acceptance of a new role reads earned by on-page events. Cost is present but subtle, centered on relinquishing certainty in the old method.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and specific, and her interiority is embodied through the foreign thump of the donor heart and the tactile focus on the wing. Contradictory impulses (self-perceived “untouched” versus conduit) surface credibly without therapy-speak. Agency is mostly attentional rather than decisional, but the earned shift at the end reads true for this length. The dye master functions more as catalyst than adversary, but her pressure is pointed.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s motives are legible and layered: duty to the estate versus reverence for the maze and a longing to reweight his sorrow. Interiority is specific (7.3 → 7.4 grays) and embodied through habitual work and the sextant’s heft. The choice to disobey the directive after the moonlit revelation reads earned rather than tidy. The cost is implied (defying proprietors) but not dramatized on the page, slightly softening the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s goal is clear and embodied—rekindling the realm—expressed through concrete micro‑choices (climbing, harvesting light, weaving, then singing). Interiority is textured (borrowed memories, ache), but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a personal price besides exertion. Competence reads high, struggle low, so change feels more attainment than sacrifice. The earned stasis (ongoing tending) lands but doesn’t expose a deeper flaw or conflict on her side.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive (answering a plea to unearth wisdom in error) is clear and consistent with her compassionate reclusiveness, and her contradiction—leaving solitude to protect and learn—feels earned. Her key micro‑choice (to “stay while leaving”) arises organically from her empathy. However, the internal struggle is relatively frictionless; she adapts quickly with little felt risk of failure. The cost of self‑dissolution is intriguing but lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motive—“to find the sacred in the ordinary”—is specific and drives concrete choices from finding the bread to planting at the bakery site. Her emotions are embodied through tactile interactions (the fossil’s weight, the gritty dust), though internal contradiction is light. Anya’s presence supports rather than pressures, limiting relational crucible. The final renunciation of mourning in favor of resurrection reads earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Archivist’s motive—“to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”—is clear and consistent, and his meticulousness shows in tactile choices (glass edge cold, brass dials, needle readings). Internal contradiction is mild; he mourns entropy yet clings to quantification until the luminous vows force a pivot. The shift in method reads earned by the on‑page discovery rather than declared. Emotional embodiment is present (“heart a heavy weight”) though a touch summarized at times.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is precise and compelling, and her embodied fear (“heart a frantic drum”) grounds her competence. The false starts reveal adaptive intelligence and limits without deflating tension. Internal contradiction is mild—duty vs. exposure/shame is present but not deeply excavated. Silas’s shame lands well as relational consequence despite minimal on‑page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s skepticism is embodied through her taste‑sensing method and fractures convincingly into awe at “the flavor of memory,” making her final choice earned. The internal contradiction (empirical skeptic vs. undeniable wonder) is dramatized, not told. The anchor is sketched rather than deeply developed, but his function as pressure is clear. The closing decision forecloses her prior path with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to “uncork suppressed creativity” is clear and embodied through shame, compulsion, and tactile action (charcoal‑stained hands). Internal contradiction—terror of overload vs. surrender to the cave’s pull—surfaces credibly at the journal’s warning and the final choice. A few insight lines tilt toward told epiphany (“use the key she already possessed”), but the decision is earned by prior beats. The visible cost—sorrow endured and risk of mind‑flood—grounds the change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives are clear and particular—revulsion at dishonesty physically sickens her while a hunger to recover “lost conversations” pulls her forward. She abandons the contract, puzzles the map, and chooses candor at the machine, each action aligned with her flaws and values. The internal conflict (complicity vs. truth) is embodied (“wilting”) rather than labeled. The final admission is earned though the cost remains more ethical/emotional than materially consequential on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—she labors for days to restore “the color of wonder,” and her seasonal muteness pushes action over explanation. Micro‑choices (placing the fragment, adjusting counterweights, waking to push rings) reveal disciplined endurance. What’s missing is a sharper contradictory impulse under pressure; her serenity never fractures, so internal tension remains limited. The final Earned Stasis feels credible and paid for, though more friction would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Caretaker-7’s motives are clear and escalate plausibly: preserve the dome → survive → sacrifice the garden by weaponizing fear. The internal contradiction (nostalgia/static vs. ruthless clarity) is dramatized in the vault and in the compression beat, not just stated. Micro-choices—entering the avoided vault, opening the box, choosing to condense fear—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The closing stance shift from caretaker to pilot feels earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The curator’s motive—proving that listening heals—drives her restraint and choices, and her patient silence feels like character, not passivity. Interiority is economical yet specific (the shift from curiosity to purpose). However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely struggles against an impulse to force the box. Matteo applies gentle pressure but does not meaningfully complicate her psychology.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and methods are concrete and embodied—she deciphers by feeling the scientist’s grief and translating it into movement. The internal tension between taking the die (power/burden) and liberating knowledge is present if slightly under-argued. Her micro‑choices (not touching the terminal, pressing wall points in rhythm, finally taking the die) align with her lyrical, empathic competence. Emotion appears through body and environment rather than labels.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and particular—his compulsion to find where deleted memories go—and his choices (following the coffee grounds, selecting and exhuming a crystal) align with that drive. The interiority is embodied and specific (hands like worn rope; reverent precision while chiseling). Internal contradiction is lighter; he endures rather than wrestles with a dilemma, though the final acceptance of “terrible, beautiful knowing” carries cost. The lantern‑lighter identity informs his reverent method and the closing stance, earning the endurance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is crystalline—hush the coded prophecy—and every action aligns with that vow. The internal conflict (anger as “loud” versus cultivated hush) surfaces under pressure when the prophecy weaponizes rage. Embodied choices—listening to willow, moss, brook; rejecting visions; channeling silence—reveal character. Slight idealization (near‑ascetic perfection) limits messier flaws but doesn’t undercut the earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s desire “to learn” and to “remember something [her] blood still knows” is clear and propels the key micro‑choice to break the unspoken rule. The mentor–student dynamic provides pressure and a meaningful cost when Mrs. Gable vanishes. Interiority is restrained but specific enough to avoid stock feeling, with the bodily tactility of the seal’s “nicks and grooves” mapping onto motive. Some conflict remains gentle, but the final endurance—being left with the burden of hearing—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s shift from skeptic‑restorer to determined liberator is cleanly motivated by the shell’s invasive sensations and the shipwreck vision. Interiority is embodied (salt‑sting, bone‑level hum) and not merely labeled. The contradiction—skepticism versus compelled belief—operates in scene and culminates in an earned renunciation of preservation for archiving. Cost is primarily emotional and stamina-based but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motives are clear and layered—obedience, understanding, and eventual forgiveness—driving concrete micro‑choices (noticing the ‘M,’ testing the vellum, choosing to destroy the decoy). Competence and vocation shape perception and action credibly. The internal shift from task to absolution is earned. A slightly smoother path—her hands “did not shake”—softens visible struggle and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her perceptual talent informs choices moment to moment. Interiority is vivid (reading echoes, the “reed‑blown melancholy”) but internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely hesitates or pays a personal cost beyond solitude. The merchant functions as an external foil more than a relational crucible. The final action aligns with her established traits and lands credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—“to salvage something pure”—is clear and consistent, and her cautious method (“weaves truth carefully”) governs her choices. Interiority is specific (cold, breath, tactile handling of the globe) and not generic. The main limitation is a lack of on‑page contradictory impulses under pressure; she never wavers in tactic or aim. The change at the end (relinquishing the charged object and the ghost’s presence) feels earned and paid for emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hideo’s motive—appreciating hidden effort—suffuses action and perception, and his key micro‑choices (lifting the whisk, withholding the whistle, the final, gentle defiance) align with a coherent, particular interiority. The “demure audacity” tension reads in scene rather than label. Status dynamics with the headman are legible and shift when the light‑net appears. The endurance choice at the end feels earned, though the personal cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive—excavate truth at any cost—is clear and consistently drives action. The micro‑conflict (leave the lie intact vs. dismantle it) is present but underplayed; he wavers little, limiting felt ambiguity. Interiority is competent but often abstracted (“comfortable lie”) rather than embodied. The final choice credibly forecloses a path with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and escalates under pressure—from patient listening to broadcasting to the renunciatory tactic of fracturing the message. Interiority is specific (sanctuary/prison, chalking the walls), with a credible push-pull between despair and whimsical hope. The final choice costs her authorship and control, reading as an earned renunciation. Minor limitation: internal contradiction could be dramatized even more directly at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear, particular motive (to translate generations) and embodied action (collecting, mixing jars) reveal him well. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers or faces a competing impulse. The “positively wistful” stance prompts action but doesn’t exact much on‑page cost. The final acceptance of service as redemption feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motive and competence are crystal clear, and her embodied fear-to-focus pivot (“Panic, cold and sharp… She could not fight them physically; she had to adapt.”) grounds credible agency. The internal tension between love and logic is present but mild; she meets pressure without a meaningful blind spot or costly misstep. Micro‑choices around tuning read specific and personal. The final identity shift (“part of the song”) is earned, though low on visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaelen’s motive—wrestling impatience into patience—drives concrete choices, from anchoring himself against the viaduct’s pull to the final unyoking. Interiority stays embodied (boots tugged, breath pluming) rather than abstract. The contradiction between craving a “crack in the sky” and choosing slow calibration remains active through the end. Only minor soft-focus lines flirt with summary rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s competing drives—professional detachment vs. witnessing with compassion—are dramatized in action (ignoring protocol, following the lantern, placing it as a marker). Interiority is specific and embodied (boots on gravel, the cough, the weight of Eli), not abstract therapy-speak. The “fortified vulnerability” line corresponds to lived choices rather than a label. The visible cost is primarily moral and vocational, felt even if institutional consequences are implied rather than explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Eli’s guilt, vocational doubt, and tenderness toward his incarcerated congregants create a credible, pressure-bearing interiority that pays off in a reframed mission. Micro-choices—entering the shop, accepting Anya’s implied diagnosis, winding the heart, and paying—align with motive. Contradictory impulses (penance vs. usefulness; deserving vs. witnessing) operate simultaneously. A slight aura of tidy epiphany remains, but it’s earned by the on‑page demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear motive (to give yearning a voice) and a consistent trait (steadfast curiosity) drive Kiv’s choices. Interiority is specific—irreverent awe warring with belief, frustration tipping into inspiration—though internal contradiction is modest. The decisive arrow‑tip choice reveals character under pressure. The cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting depth of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—obsessively locating the “deleted”—is clear and consistently drives her choices through to the risky disclosure. The career-vs-truth dilemma surfaces credibly at the end, with a concrete act (uploading) that forecloses safety. Interiority is specific (metadata ghosts, sensed absence) but internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than deeply embodied in moment-to-moment pressure. The character reads unique, though her struggle could carry more visceral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear motivation—duty versus empathy—animates credible choices, with the defiance of orders as the key internal conflict. Interiority is anchored in concrete perception (shadows recoiling, frost-bitten apples), not labels. The ease with which the engineers accept her evidence softens felt cost and limits complexity at the climax. Still, actions consistently reveal a calmly intuitive character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—seeking the sound of endings as a euthanasia tourist—feels specific and embodied, and her arc from pursuit to acceptance is credible. Interiority is textured (ice “speaks,” wind as agency), with micro‑choices like pocketing and later releasing the parasol tip revealing values. The contradiction between her trawling for an external sign and discovering an internal release lands. If anything, the realization approaches tidiness, but it’s earned by the old woman’s anecdote and the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—transforming private pain into shared understanding—is clear and enacted through specific choices (investigating, approaching Leo, framing their talk through grafting). The remembered letter adds credible pressure, though internal contradiction remains understated rather than dramatized in-scene. Leo’s quick confession feels plausible given her tact, but borders on convenient. The abstract phrase “intersubjective understanding” skews label-like compared to the otherwise embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s goal is clean and compelling, and her tactics (peripheral sensing, conjuring the clearing, weaving the scout’s perception) align with it. However, her interior contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or reveals cost beyond exertion. The scout’s candid presence usefully pressures her process and reveals her adaptability. The closing weariness reads, but a sharper moral or emotional trade‑off would deepen character change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive and temperament (“perceptively calm” archivist seeking to transmute pain) are clear and consistent, and her choice to go to the factory and then cede the project to the town lands credibly. Interiority is restrained but specific (matching cufflink to watch face; the realization about the lavender tip). Internal contradiction is mild—she’s steady rather than conflicted—so the emotional price of sharing authorship is felt but not deeply contested. Dialogue with the historian adds a light relational crucible without diluting her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive is crystal clear and organically rooted in her temperament: a reticent scholar driven to restore linguistic growth. The internal contradiction—her habitual silence versus the duty to testify—culminates in a credible, earned break from reticence. Embodied beats (ink-smudged fingers, breathless hush, heart hammering) ground emotion without therapy-speak. The cost is felt but modestly framed (social risk, self-betrayal of silence), keeping this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silas’s longing and constraint (“precognitively forgetful”) drive clear, embodied micro‑choices—driftwood trails, the chalk circle, pressing his ear to the bus. His contradictory impulses—lucid precognition vs. immediate forgetting—act simultaneously in scene, generating credible urgency. The tear at the fragmentary payoff shows cost without sentimentality. The Earned Stasis of recommitting to the cycle reads motivated and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s vocation, composure, and motive (“to harness the ephemeral”) are clear and drive her choices under pressure. We glimpse embodied focus and an earned endurance rather than panic, but contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers beyond a poised calm. The pivot from image‑keeper to silence‑forger suggests a subtle renunciation, though the cost is mostly tonal. Strong single‑POV interiority, if a touch idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and competence are crystalline and her micro‑choices (how she uses the shard, modulating pressure and pace) reveal character. The “decisively kind” stance informs her refusal of false hope and her ritual precision. Internal contradiction is light—she executes without visible wobble—so struggle is more professional than personal. Arthur’s reactions add embodied emotion but remain secondary.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive is specific and consistent, and her tactic shift from data to embodied description reveals character under pressure. The frustration beat before her pivot provides a credible micro-conflict. The change isn’t morally costly, but it does foreclose a purely academic approach. Secondary character (automaton) functions as crucible for her motives without stealing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motives are precise and embodied—urgent maternal need tempered by “forgiving skepticism” and the urge to “turn mistakes into constellations.” Her relief colliding with empathy at the bassinet is a credible contradiction that guides the choice to help the Fae. Micro‑choices (probing the wrist, returning the tooth) align with character. The internal shift to a “wiser, more generous kind of knowing” is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and consistent: she wants to “share light without using fire” while guarding her solitude. The internal conflict is dramatized on the page through the tactile polishing and the explicit weighing of purpose versus isolation. Micro‑choices—choosing the seat, polishing with her cloak, aligning the shard to the fissure—reveal values under pressure. The felt cost (giving up private beauty) is present but lightly rendered rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyra’s motive—to reclaim meaning after exposure—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives her quiet actions (tending, inviting, proffering). Her guarded generosity toward Leo reveals contradiction (self‑protective yet offering contact) without therapy‑speak. The relationship dynamic is delicately staged through the offering and his phone put‑away choice. The change—solitary refuge to shared, risky co‑creation—reads earned with a felt cost of renewed exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grief, shame, and love coexist on the page, with embodied details (worrying the shell, walking against the tide) revealing a specific, flawed man. The theft of Clara’s words and his cynicism provide a credible internal contradiction that the closing vow meaningfully confronts. Motivation is clear and intensifies as he moves deeper into the nexus. A touch of stated abstraction (“built a career on lies”) keeps it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive—reviving sacred practices—stays clear and consistent, and her tinkerer-vs-singer tension personalizes the stakes. Interiority is embodied (“fingers still tingling,” “tears tracing clean paths”), giving concrete emotion. However, conflict within her (doubt vs. faith) resolves quickly once the device works, with limited on‑page struggle under peak pressure. The final choice carries little visible cost beyond fear of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—preservation through “translating heartbeats into maps”—is clear and embodied in patient, ritualized action. Her physical patience (waiting an hour for auroral light) reveals character under pressure without speechifying. The visible cost at closure (sublimation of gathered objects, spent essence) reads as an earned renunciation. Slight limitation: interior contradiction is muted; she remains serenely competent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive and competence are clear and character‑particular, with tactile micro‑choices (mapping acoustics, crafting parts) revealing her mind. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she faces little pressure that exposes flaw or divided impulse. The endurance of solitude and patience is implied rather than dramatized. The closing satisfaction is earned but emotionally calibrated on the safe side.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s compulsion to archive sorrow is vivid and specific, and her despair when the weave collapses is embodied and credible. The decisive, character‑driven reorientation—turning her back on the lamp to weave blindly—feels earned by her craft‑honed perception. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. entombment, control vs. surrender) operate on the page. The cost is subtle but legible: she risks failure and renounces self‑referential control to align with something larger.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to “harvest lessons from loss” by carving—is clear and enacted through tactile, character‑specific choices. Embodied memory (“a callus that had once been his”) gives her grief texture beyond labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal—she’s largely steady rather than actively torn—yet the Earned Stasis at the kettle’s whistle feels credible. The choice to complete the carving and accept the hollow “as a foundation” lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—seeking release from a former self—drives clear, credible choices, and her embodied perceptions (cloud‑moss, chill, brittle plastic) keep emotion grounded. The internal contradiction (wanting to let go vs. needing that blueprint to endure) plays in-scene and culminates in a believable renunciation/reconfiguration. Dialogue with the ghost sharpens status and stakes. Minor ding for slightly thesis-like lines (“I am not your regret. I am your blueprint.”).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming utility from dereliction—and her choices (gantry mapping, pipe realignment, solar calibration) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied through workmanlike focus rather than declarations. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little psychological or relational resistance, limiting depth. The endurance over three days hints at cost but doesn’t expose a conflicted hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—retreat from creation after a wounding critique and a summons to face it—reads clean and compels the central choice. Interiority is embodied (“ache in her bones,” “smallest, bravest push”) and consistent with her “excruciatingly gentle” manner. The final act costs her safety and self‑concept, not in grand drama but as credible vulnerability. Minor note: conflict is almost entirely internal, but it still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clean and consistent—seeking the buried truth behind a myth—and her methodical choices (grappling, cleaning, reading) align with that drive. The change lands as an earned internal reconfiguration rather than a tidy epiphany. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal; she rarely wavers or risks, which slightly limits depth. The cost is felt but largely conceptual and inward.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive (preserve ancient methods) is clear and embodied in how she studies and coaxes the knot, not merely stated. Interiority is specific and tactile (cold in boots, fog on hood), though true contradictory impulses are minimal. Her agency at the peak—choosing patience over force—aligns cleanly with her identity. The relationship with Amos adds quiet pressure but doesn’t significantly complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation—mapping the “geography of healing”—is specific and consistently embodied in her choices, especially accepting the thread and allowing the projection to overtake her. Isolde’s grief-as-presence reads distinct and credible, with her single line and guided action revealing character under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; Elara operates with quiet certainty more than fraught conflict, which trims some edge. The closing renunciation of a tidy “moving on” arc feels earned by prior perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and embodied—he acts from loneliness and a stubborn, meticulous curiosity—and his agency drives every beat. Interiority is specific (trembling hands, prayer‑like assembly), though the piece favors a singular drive over contradictory impulses. The emotional cost at closure—success and failure at once—lands credibly. A deeper on‑page contradiction (e.g., fear of profaning the dead species vs. urge to resurrect) could raise this further.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motive—atonement through service and ritual—is clear, embodied, and consistent with her paradoxical inheritance. Micro‑choices (selecting the scarred tree, working mineral sand, tying the coin) reveal values without speechifying. Internal contradiction (arsonist’s daughter/firefighter) is potent but not deeply stress‑tested on the page. The cost is mostly spiritual and serene, not contested under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive (“to liberate trapped memories”) is clear and consistent, and her internal contradiction—luminous skeptic—surfaces at the hinge (“her skepticism warred with her hope”). Her micro-choices (reading breadcrumb patterns; pressing the lid with will) align with her traits. The cost is subtle—she surrenders the shelter of doubt and the city loses the anesthesia of forgetting—but it’s present. A slightly sharper on‑page consequence for her would raise this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character-particular (an archivist who “shares light without using fire”), and her choice to shift from archiving to intervention is earned by the gear’s revelations. Interiority is textured with melancholy and duty, though the internal contradiction (custodian vs. agent) is more thematic than dramatized in a pressured moment. Embodied emotion appears (“heavy weight in her being”) but skews abstract. Strong, but a touch more on-page friction or cost in the choice would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s motive—“to discover the shape of collective grief”—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (following the ribbon, attentive witnessing). Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (craft detail, tactile perception), though genuine internal conflict is minimal, producing a relatively frictionless progression. The final reorientation of her craft reads earned by prior perception. A stronger moment of doubt or competing value under pressure could have deepened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s duty-driven psyche and guilt economy are concrete, with embodied choices (wading into surf, leaving the bob, stilling the clock) revealing layered conflict between precision and chaos. The father reverie adds lineage pressure without bogging down. Her renunciation is earned by the established tally ritual and sense of debt. A slightly declarative final insight (“absolution…not incremental, but instantaneous”) trims some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and her patient, methodical temperament credibly drives each micro‑choice (tracing threads, testing the golden filament). Interiority is implied through tactile focus rather than told feelings, keeping her distinct. The change at the end—accepting a resurrection role—reads earned but carries limited on‑page ambivalence or conflicting impulse. A touch more friction or visible cost in the acceptance would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and particular—seed innovation within the ice’s constraint—and her doubt versus duty conflict operates on the page. Embodied details (the blank page, aching hand, breath) keep emotion grounded. The choice to write, despite heresy and risk, feels earned by prior modeling and fear. The visible cost is commitment under uncertainty rather than triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives are precise and character‑specific: a copyist who risks herself nightly to revive outlawed stories through dust. Interiority is embodied through concrete actions (cloaking the window, tuning the radio, listening to the radiator’s hum). The arc from “teach” to “translate” is credible and earned. Internal contradiction is minimal, so pressure reads more devotional than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—“to crystallize a fleeting emotion”—is precise and embodied in careful, risk‑laden action. The contradiction between offering the public a “mirage of safety” and her own inability to claim it gives her interiority bite. Micro‑choices (breath control, steadiness, non‑reaction to loss) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight limitation: interior conflict is serene rather than contested, with few messy impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motive (preservation vs. social stability) is clear and his contradictory impulses are dramatized in the choice to withhold the “ugly truth” while teaching method. His interiority is specific (the cog biting into his palm; the star charts) and aligns with action. Elara’s counter‑narrative applies direct pressure and her voice contrasts his. The slight quickness of her shift to curiosity trims some grit from the relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Two distinct, credible motives meet under pressure: Anya’s duty to salvage a student and a dying program; Leo’s defensive anger and isolation. Anya’s tactical demonstration (noise vs. harmony) reveals character through action. Leo’s “How?” is an earned micro‑turn; the cost is giving up the fight he came prepared for. Slight tidiness in the speed of his shift keeps it below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—to coax beauty from ruin—drives clear, embodied choices (planting, pruning, tasting). Her interiority is specific (static on skin, trembling hand, dread at delay) and her “compassionate editing” frames a credible ethic under pressure. Internal tension registers as pain vs purpose during pruning, though contradiction is more implied than dramatized. The final act reads earned with a felt psychic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive—preserving wonder—translates into concrete, pressured choices, especially risking her private secret to help. Her involuntary truth-telling creates embodied awkwardness (“It looks like a sad metal heart”) that reveals character under stress. The relationship dynamic with the skeptical technician shifts credibly from unease to shared purpose. Slight convenience exists in the technician’s swift interpretive leap, limiting deeper internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motive is clear from the outset and her choices (attic search, collecting objects, final placement of the bay stone) align with that motive and reveal her shift from observer to participant. Internal contradiction is gentle but present: analyst vs. ritualist. Emotional embodiment comes through tactile handling of objects and sensory triggers rather than labels. The cost is subtle—ceding the clinical stance for belonging—but credible at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Statue’s certainty-versus-understanding conflict is cleanly dramatized and culminates in a credible, earned shift when it points to the fracture and reinterprets its vigil. The historian’s motive (“incisively kind”) tracks in her methodical, non-destructive actions. Interiority is distinct for a sentient stone observer and avoids stock emotion labels. The only slight limitation is the low resistance—change arrives without much internal pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motive—controlling chance to touch a missed choice—is concrete and particular, filtered through tactile habits (the chipped die, chalk). Her internal contradiction (quantifying chaos vs. trusting it) acts in scene and culminates in a choice with cost. Emotional texture is embodied rather than labeled. A slight tendency to state insights (“This was the true nature…”) trims some mystery from her interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive (“to prove that strangers remember kindness”) is clean, embodied by her insomnia and ritual returns to the greenhouse. Interiority is specific (the “saffron quiet” stilling her mind) and actions align with motive (she paints, curates, invites). The ending earns a credible endurance-to-rest turn with insomnia as the visible cost. A sharper on-page tug-of-war or contradictory impulse under pressure would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and propulsive, and the narrator’s embodied pursuit (“fingers raw,” the shock of light) grounds action. However, the POV character’s interior contradictions remain muted; they function more as a capable witness than a pressured self with competing impulses. The final communal act reads earned, but the personal cost for the narrator is modest. Elara’s shift from preservation to adaptation (wax over bread) is the most distinct character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elias’s motivation is clear and particular, rooted in his “neatly inventive” contrarian mind and the hunger stone/lighthouse cue. Interiority is textured (oil‑stained fingers, bleak exhilaration), though true contradictory impulses under pressure are light—he rarely doubts or strains. Actions align with motive and reveal character through choice (dousing the beam, pushing the master gear). The final stance lands as prideful repricing more than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive transitions cleanly from survival to strategic understanding, and the contradiction between the mirrors’ panic and her steadiness feels character‑specific. Her choice to “unbosom” coded fears under pressure reads as a credible, costly tactic. The advisor’s presence sharpens her interiority rather than replacing it. Minor gap: her curiosity over self‑preservation could carry a sharper felt risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motivation is clear and baked into every move: “to turn obstacles into instruments.” The embodied confidence (“He did not fight. He conducted.”) is striking, but internal contradiction or real doubt never surfaces, so pressure reveals little new about Kai. Micro‑choices (tracing vs. striking; dubbing the wind) align cleanly with his ethos. The cost registers lightly as bodily exhaustion and the orchard’s scars rather than a deeper character price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaelen’s motive is clear and consistent, and his methodical, nonviolent approach embodies “quietly driven.” Interiority is specific enough (map grooves, far‑seeing glass, pattern language) but lacks a live contradiction under pressure. The cost—defying the Council’s prohibition and breaking the gate—registers, if lightly. The ending reframes his role credibly, though the shift is stated a touch on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and his “emotionally rational” lens drives his tactics under pressure. The internal tug—his life’s work resting on a possibly rotten foundation—registers, though his choice path reads slightly neat. Elara functions as a credible counterforce, but her reversal feels quick, with limited visible cost. The handover is earned, yet the scene could reveal more contradictory impulses at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is precise and embodied—he embeds memories in repairs to honor his mother—and the locket triggers a credible rupture of his “stoic” armor. Micro‑choices (timing the bridge, wading carefully, choosing what to write) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (control vs. grief) act in scene and culminate in an earned, costly tenderness. Minor note: a hint more flaw or risk beyond emotional cost could deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s drive to “trace honest origins” is clear, embodied in tactile choices (navigating by memory, seeking the stamp) and a morally thorny final act. The internal contradiction—truth-seeking versus institutional harm—is dramatized rather than summarized. Her calm perceptual mode feels character‑particular and constrains tactics. A slightly greater on‑page visceral cost (fear of consequences, bodily stakes) could have deepened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and particular: transform grief through craft when paper fails her. Interiority is embodied (pigment‑stained fingers, breath shaping glass) with a credible contradiction (ascend/descend hope/despair). The decisive renunciation—releasing her last dream of her brother—lands as a paid cost. Slight idealization of competence is balanced by earlier failure with paper, keeping her human.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is precise and character‑particular—hunting “unused potential” after surviving a drone strike, not revenge—and her actions align with that stance. Interiority is embodied (the milky eye, the ache, zero‑g economy) and her bleak exhilaration adds contradiction without tidy resolution. The final renunciation (no joy, only method) is credible for this length. A deeper on‑page clash of impulses under pressure (risking something to take the reading) could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation (decoding belonging) is clear and sharpened by the “observe, don’t interfere” constraint, yielding a credible rule‑break when she inserts the chip. Interiority is concrete (ocular implants, heart hammering) with a tangible shift from observer to participant. The ending change—settling from perpetual surprise to calm—reads earned. A slight tilt toward tidy enlightenment softens the felt messiness of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied—ritualized driftwood sifting, the watch hand warming, the tremor when the true memory leaks in. Her contradictory impulses (to comfort clients vs. to honor truth) act simultaneously on the page and force a costly stance. The choice to bury the truth (“She would give the man the peace he thought he wanted.”) reads motivated by guilt and tradeoffs. The final renunciation feels earned and forecloses a path with visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motives and tactics are clear and character‑specific: patience, ritual, and the tactile drawer pull as a moral lever. Her micro‑choices under pressure (waiting for the moon, refusing to step between guns, using the object) align with her ethos. Interiority is present if restrained, favoring action filtered through a disciplined mind. The commanders are sketched functionally but their status dynamics register in the moment of near violence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motives and contradictions are cleanly dramatized: a broken professional trying a humble, almost absurd method while wanting both to turn back and to push forward. His micro‑choices (righting the kayak, forcing more strokes, then choosing to drift) align with his interior weather. The renunciation at the end (attention over ambition) feels earned and comes with a credible cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with only a trace of abstract labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive (kindling empathy) is clear and rooted in her past as a forger, and her micro‑choices—decoding newspapers, entering the caves, and ultimately relinquishing the ball—align under pressure. Interiority is specific (thief’s fingers, reading misalignments) and embodied. The decisive renunciation at the end is earned. Slight over‑articulation of realization (“The real labyrinth…”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive is urgent and legible from the first line, and her shift from resurrection to merger is earned by the failed conjuring and the fortune’s reweighting. Interiority is concrete (the weight of Fenrir’s head; the hand passing through his shoulder) and her sob/despair create a credible cost. The contradictory impulses—clinging to the past versus accepting transformation—operate simultaneously at the crisis. Minor limitation: her flaw profile remains idealized; we glimpse grief, less so the messy irrationality that could complicate her choice further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silas’s drive—new father desperate to reclaim “lost time”—is specific, embodied, and consistent, and his micro‑choices (blood offering, proceeding despite the Keeper’s warning) align with that motive. Contradictory impulses surface credibly: reverence and fear, control and surrender. The witnessing of missed moments supplies real cost and earns his final renunciation. Slight tidiness in the final clarity keeps this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s pacifist-mender identity cleanly motivates every choice, and her shift from paralysis to stitching reads earned. Interiority is specific (gravity as felt sorrow), though contradictions are gentle rather than searing. The visible cost is emotional labor and endurance rather than sacrifice of an external good, scaled credibly to this length. A richer clash between refusal and need would nudge this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and specific, and her micro‑choices (the detour, unclasping the jar, staying to watch) align with her need. The cost—relinquishing her last possession—lands credibly. However, internal conflict is muted; the “compulsion” to open the jar bypasses friction, softening character agency at the peak. The epiphany risks neatness, though it is anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kael’s motive—“a higher fidelity” opposed to the Luminary’s hoarding—is clear and drives each tactic. His calm ingenuity is convincingly embodied through specific micro‑choices (quill holder repurposing, sundial cipher). Internal contradiction is light; he rarely falters or pays a visible emotional price, which mutes depth. The end’s charged poise implies risk but doesn’t press him into a morally consequential confrontation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is sharply etched and enacted through concrete micro-choices (stone‑placing, choosing alignment over control). The curse complicates his perception and complicates motive without collapsing into label‑speak. The renunciation at the end (to align, not control) reads as an earned change with a felt cost to identity. Slight lack of embodied stress responses undercuts peak pressure by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motive—transforming preservation into revelation—progresses credibly under the live constraint of the patrol clock. Her contradictory impulses (safety vs. witness) operate simultaneously and resolve through action: reading aloud, forging a new poem, releasing it. Embodied details (the timer’s tick, storm-scented ozone, the ventilation shaft) ground her interiority. The cost—abandoning anonymity for dissemination—is felt even without a patrol confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific, and her mechanical arm subtly signals prior cost. The alliance turn grows from her interpretive agency, but internal contradiction and felt struggle are light; the pivot reads smooth rather than hard‑won. Status dynamics with Kaelen are legible and modulate through courtesy to partnership. The closing acceptance forecloses the duel path, though the emotional price isn’t deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ezra’s motive—“to forge beauty from anarchy”—is dramatized through the decision to open the private stacks and to compile the inmates’ voices, with panic flickering when his persona risks exposure. The relationship with Silas works as crucible: a silent invitation becomes shared risk and alters their bond. Interiority is clear and embodied (tin’s rattle as anchor; trembling hand at the lock), though contradictions under peak pressure could tighten further. The cost to Ezra’s chameleoning remains mostly implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motive is crystal clear and embodied in concrete actions (stealing the false key, repurposing the clock), and her grief has texture. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost remain understated; her competence faces little friction, which limits depth. The final acceptance of an “encore, not reversal” lands, but the felt sacrifice is more conceptual than dramatized. Strong, specific, but missing one messy, character‑revealing snag under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s drive—to protect Aetherium’s cultural memory—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (trance, digging, pouring lived experience into the seed). The “empirically whimsical” lens personalizes her perception and action. Luminous doubt registers as a real hesitation right before the rain hits, but the internal conflict remains relatively tidy. The ending shifts her stance from uncertainty to earned conviction without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s longing “to find the color of unspoken apologies” is clear, embodied, and credibly transformed through tactile engagement with the lace. Her initial numbness (“I cannot hear anything”) yields to an earned recognition rather than a tidy cure. Kaito’s gentle pressure (compass, instruction to “listen through your fingers”) is minimal but effective as catalyst. The cost—acceptance without erasure—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Aris's motivation and internal conflict are established with exceptional clarity and economy. The character-specific habit of mind, "preprocesses reality," provides a strong baseline against which her change is measured. The micro-choice to peel the wing from the thorn "with a tenderness that surprised her" is a perfectly executed moment of internal contradiction that makes her final, earned shift to "patient, and finally, quiet" feel both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her final transformation is earned by the plot's revelation. However, the initial shift from grieving artist to lucid investigator is slightly abrupt, rationalized by the label "steadily adaptive" rather than fully dramatized through contradictory internal states. Her grief feels more like a premise than an active, embodied pressure throughout the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is singular, clear, and powerfully established by her backstory. Her interiority is rendered with unique, concrete details tied to her sensory experience, avoiding stock phrasing. While her competence and struggle are compellingly externalized, the story lacks a significant internal contradiction acting in-scene; her path to the solution is one of pure effort and discovery, not one complicated by a flaw or competing impulse.

    Silas’s motivation—the pursuit of "chased stillness"—is established early and provides a strong, consistent engine for his internal conflict. His initial resistance, born of exhaustion rather than malice, is credible, making his eventual decision to answer the call feel earned. The way his undertaker skills translate to the restoration is a deft touch, but the final epiphany feels slightly more observed than embodied in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final actions are earned, but her characterization leans toward the archetypal. She is presented as a near-flawless leader, lacking the internal contradictions or specific flaws that would elevate her from a symbol of hope to a more complex, memorable individual. A moment of genuine doubt or a conflicting impulse before her final declaration would have deepened the portrayal significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The character's motivation is clear and effectively drives the story's single scene. However, the interiority relies on over-articulated, diagnostic emotional summaries, such as "the sorrow acknowledged and held" and "no longer a wound but a source of strength." This flattens the emotional progression by labeling the resolution rather than embodying it through a more contradictory or visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her professional expertise as a "cartographer of spaces" provides a solid foundation for her eventual solution. The characterization is strong through the setup and crisis. However, the final paragraph lapses into abstract summary ("The experience was a paradox..."), which reads more like an author's thematic statement than a character's embodied, reeling thoughts in the immediate aftermath of a terrifying event.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving her actions with a consistency that holds under pressure. Her interiority is concrete, though phrases like "heart hammered" lean toward stock expression. The character is defined more by her unwavering competence than by internal contradiction, but her final, costly choice to become the vault's guardian feels earned and aligned with her established drive.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is singular, powerful, and deeply rooted in the backstory provided. Her interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity, particularly through the synesthetic experience which avoids cliché and becomes a core narrative mechanic. The final shift from a desire to "fix" to a need to "witness" is an earned and moving change, representing a sophisticated internal resolution that feels both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal conflict is effectively dramatized in the pivotal moment. The shift from professional thief to moral protector is earned by the power of the on-page event. However, the realization that her client is a "jealous rival" is a sudden inferential leap that feels slightly too convenient and certain, lacking a prior concrete cue to ground it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's character is well-defined and her motivation is clear, but her interiority occasionally lapses into diagnostic self-awareness. The line "it was a violent, cracking, painful thawing heart" states the theme too directly, replacing embodied emotion with a label. The shift in perspective regarding the bookmark is powerful but feels slightly too swift and complete for a deeply held grief.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character's motivation is sharp and the internal conflict between his ingrained terror and newfound purpose is well-dramatized, especially when he kneels for the cast despite his phobia. However, the interiority occasionally relies on abstract labels ("transformative betrayal," "obliteration of his very self") instead of purely embodied experience. The final shift to a "new Leo" is earned within the scene's arc, but the character's self-awareness verges on the diagnostic, slightly undermining the raw emotion of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Oracle's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, her obsession demonstrated through painstaking action rather than mere summary. Her interiority is a direct reflection of her purpose, filtering the world through the lens of silence. The final weariness and small smile constitute an earned emotional closure, with the cost of her effort embodied in her burning muscles and stinging eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The robot’s motivation is clear and compelling, and its primary trait—composure—is not merely stated but functions as the crucial tool for navigating the story’s central conflict. The backstory of its "I wonder" moment is perfectly placed, providing an earned, particular reason for its unique situation. The final shift in understanding is a credible change earned through the preceding struggle, representing a profound character evolution without resorting to human-centric emotional clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, driving every micro-choice from taking the lens to the final, silent offering. Her interiority is concrete and specific, particularly in the line "eavesdropping on her own life." The resolution is earned through her tangible action, which demonstrates a change in understanding rather than simply stating it, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a visible cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, rooted in a clear and compelling motivation that is embodied rather than stated. Her quiet defiance is perfectly captured in micro-choices, like her hands never stilling their polishing. The single sentence explaining the “mended deception” feels slightly less filtered through her immediate consciousness than the rest of the narration, a minor slip in an otherwise masterfully drawn portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, effectively synthesizing the practical, embodied competence of a "sky mechanic" with the intellectual drive of a theorist. Her motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative with a quiet intensity. The final shift from seeking proof to achieving a "subdued awakening" is an earned and resonant change, showcasing a character who values understanding over glory.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara's motivation to connect with her predecessor is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her identity as a cellist is seamlessly integrated, making her choices feel authentic and necessary. The internal conflict—being inspired by silence yet needing to disrupt it—provides a solid foundation, though the emotional progression through the "conversation" is somewhat linear, moving from curiosity to awe without significant internal contradiction or struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, potent, and sustained. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific language like "hollowed out and clear" and "auroral sorrow," avoiding diagnostic labels. Her competence is balanced with vulnerability, particularly in the moment of despair on the gantry, which makes her subsequent analytical leap feel earned. The final state of "grim peace" is a compelling and credible resolution to her internal conflict, achieved through action with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb for this length. Leo’s motivation is crystalline, and the internal conflict between his "religiously skeptical" nature and the unfolding sensory evidence is embodied, not just stated. The choice to throw his weight against the wheel is a perfect culmination of his drive. The final line's insight is slightly more stated than earned, a minor abstraction after such a concrete physical climax, but it lands with sufficient force due to the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Keeper’s motivation is crystalline and drives the plot, but the characterization is more archetypal than individual. While his competence is central to the concept, the absence of any internal conflict, contradictory impulse, or genuine struggle makes him a flawless vessel for the theme rather than a complex entity. His interiority is expressed through philosophical statements ("grips reality loosely," "witness change without judgment") rather than embodied, moment-to-moment experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is consistently dramatized, and her pivotal choice to use the eclipse is a believable risk rooted in her established philosophy. Leo’s change is earned and impactful. The characterization is strong, though a few moments of interiority rely on labels like "cautious exuberance" rather than fully embodied perception, which slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and provides a strong engine for the plot, escalating credibly from historical curiosity to a species-level mission. Her competence is well-established through action. However, her interiority occasionally relies on abstract, diagnostic labels ("a catatonia of the soul"), which feel more like authorial summary than a character's specific, embodied thought process in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Leo's motivation is clear and his final transformation is conceptually sound, resolving the "familiar enigma" of his life. However, the final acceptance is instantaneous—a "terrifying, brilliant clarity" that lacks a moment of embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulse on the page. The shift is so swift it feels more like a concept clicking into place than a man grappling with a life-shattering choice, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ansel's motivation is clear and his internal conflict is central to the plot. The transformation from defender to integrator is profound, but the speed of his core belief shattering ("A terrifying idea bloomed") feels slightly compressed. While the story's conceptual nature supports a rapid epiphany, a moment more of dramatized struggle before acceptance would have elevated an already strong character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is both specific and abstract, a compelling combination. The "chronologically homesick heart" is grounded in the concrete memory of the seashell, making her grand ambition—to conduct unheard symphonies—feel earned rather than merely declared. Her final change, the loss of homesickness replaced by "arrival," is a direct result of her efforts, and the cost of her struggle is embodied in her final collapse, satisfying the 9+ test for an earned choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    The character's motivation is strong and clear, but the climax relies on an overly diagnostic self-awareness. The line "...to accept that her motivation was not born of strength, but of a fear of being ordinary" reads more like a therapist's summary than an embodied, in-the-moment realization, slightly undercutting an otherwise powerful internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to defeat her numbness is clear, consistent, and powerfully dramatized. The internal conflict is embodied effectively, and the final change is earned through on-page struggle, culminating in a credible and moving transformation that forecloses her prior state of disconnection with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with her meticulous nature being the direct engine of the plot. Her motivation—"to nurture integrity in solitude"—is clearly stated and then powerfully tested, forcing a choice that redefines it. The internal conflict between fear (from being followed) and scientific integrity is palpable and drives the narrative toward an earned, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation and wistful temperament are strongly established and consistent. Her internal conflict is powerfully embodied in the climactic moment of grief. However, Kaelen’s characterization is slightly weakened by the final dialogue, “The mind remembers, but the soul weeps,” which verges on diagnostic label-speak, articulating the story's theme with a bit too much directness for an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the entire narrative. The story successfully tests his "ethically playful" nature against an absolute moral stake, leading to a credible renunciation. The primary weakness is a tendency toward direct labeling, such as stating his ethical stance outright rather than showing it first, and the final realization being articulated in slightly too-neat summary terms.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, leading directly to the pivotal micro-choice in the climax: shifting from fighting the silence to playing with it. This internal conflict is well-dramatized and her ultimate action feels earned. Her characterization is strong, though the grandfather is a functional archetype rather than a fully drawn individual.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a powerful and earned internal transformation. The shift from "affectionate detachment" to "painful, genuine care" is not just stated but dramatized through her climactic choice. The contradiction between her professional pride and the sudden, overwhelming empathy is made visceral, compelling the final act of renunciation and self-sacrifice with a clearly legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and well-grounded in the opening scene's emotional experience. Her internal state is conveyed with specificity ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive"). The choice to include the photo, while a whim, feels earned by the associative link to her grandmother, neatly tying the story's action to its theme. The final shift in her emotional state—from giver to receiver—is a credible and resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is singular, clear, and powerfully rendered as a "physical weight." Her final choice to "build them a welcome" rather than expose the artist is a credible and moving expression of her core need to belong. The interiority is strong, especially the recurring "ache," but some descriptive labels for her character, like "boldly sympathetic nature," feel slightly told rather than purely shown through her unique marsh-based insights.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is singular, compelling, and consistent, driving every action. The character is defined by her obsession, and her choices, particularly the final act of creation, are a direct and earned consequence of that drive. However, her interiority reads as slightly more intellectual than embodied; the "quiet desperation" is stated but less viscerally felt in her perceptions, making her a highly effective but somewhat cool-to-the-touch vessel for the story's powerful concept.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular, potent, and flawlessly sustained. The internal conflict between her precise, methodical coping mechanism and the raw sorrow it seeks to contain is dramatized with exceptional nuance. The final shift in perspective is not an unearned epiphany but a direct result of her interaction with the world, earning a difficult and credible change. A minor deduction for the slightly diagnostic phrase "gently inventive way of coping," which labels the behavior the story otherwise shows perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and the arc from passive caretaker to active benefactor is earned and emotionally resonant. The central contradiction—seeking visibility while remaining hidden—is resolved with poignant nuance. The memory of Ms. Gable provides a powerful and specific anchor for his transformation, making the final choice feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation and internal conflict are rendered with convincing specificity, creating a compelling and earned character arc. The transformation from detached observer to active participant feels psychologically true. The score is capped from the 9-band due to a slight tendency toward over-articulated self-awareness in the final paragraphs, where embodied experience gives way to a summary of lessons learned, as in "Elara no longer just studied behaviors; she embodied them."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative from the first sentence. The change in her state is earned through the central encounter. However, the epiphany is slightly over-articulated with "But true meaning, she saw, was found in the transfer," which reads like a diagnostic summary rather than a fully embodied realization, preventing a score in the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, anchored by a compelling internal conflict between her known power and an anomaly she cannot perceive. Her transformation from a seer of grand futures to an observer of present wonders is earned through the story’s central event. The final choice is a renunciation of her old way of seeing, and the cost—the alteration of her gift—is made legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as the story's engine, evolving from a professional drive into a deeply personal quest. The internal conflict between her role as an archivist and the subject of her own archival discovery is potent. Her final choice—to reframe the tragedy as a paradoxical liberation for others—is earned and demonstrates a significant, credible character change with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and culminates in an earned choice. The core internal conflict—a meticulous mapper who cannot chart her own life—is elegantly resolved when she must voice an unmappable internal truth to proceed. The final choice feels inevitable due to the strong causal setup, and the cost of her confession is tangible, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement of contradictory impulses resolving with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s central conflict as a “sympathetic skeptic” is dramatized effectively, particularly in the key beat where she wants to drop the tile but her kindness compels her to hold on. The internal contradiction feels active and earned. The transition from observer to participant is motivated and clear, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. A slight deduction is for the direct labeling of her "core attribute," which verges on diagnostic summary rather than pure embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    The character's motivation is established with powerful economy, shifting credibly from millennia of ennui to a flicker of intrigue. The internal contradiction between her weariness and this nascent curiosity drives the central choice. The final change is earned by the climactic experience, resolving her core desire with a solemn understanding rather than a simplistic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal conflict between her absolutist, mathematical worldview and her father’s fluid morality is the story's powerful engine. The transition from seeking a "balanced equation" to accepting a "gift" is a significant, earned character change. Her motivation is clear, and her final choice to protect the con feels like an inevitable, costly resolution of her contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is rendered with concrete sensory detail ("vibrate in the crown of her head") rather than abstract labels, and her defining trait of being "earnestly studious" is shown, not told, through her methodical actions. The final change—her profound peace and deepened understanding—is earned directly by the central experience, representing a credible shift in her worldview and fulfilling the 9+ quick test of an earned renunciation (of a simpler goal) with a felt cost (the moment's fleeting nature).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The character's motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling, earned transformation from a passive archivist of echoes to an active agent of justice. The shift is catalyzed by a concrete object, making the change credible. While the interiority is strong, a few phrases like "clerical extinction" feel more like an author's high-register summary than a character's immediate perception, a minor distance issue.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc toward synthesizing her family's opposing worldviews is compelling. Her final action feels earned and aligned with this new understanding. The characterization is slightly weakened by moments of interiority that read as direct thematic summary ("She was their synthesis"), which reports the change rather than fully embodying it in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)
    Lyra's motivation and internal conflict—her "dual allegiance"—are established with superb economy and drive the entire narrative. The shift from "hopeful desperation" to "steady resolve" is earned through her on-page interaction with Hem and her observation of the community's response. The physical weight of the foundation stone chip provides a powerful, embodied anchor for her emotional state, making her final internal stance feel both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving logically from personal melancholy to focused witness. Her interiority is generally effective, though it occasionally relies on summary, as in "Her melancholy sharpened into focused urgency," which tells rather than embodies the shift. While she serves as an effective lens for the story's events, a deeper sense of internal contradiction or flaw would elevate the characterization from highly competent to truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, but her characterization lacks texture. Her "magnetic calm" and immediate sense of purpose ("This was her purpose.") feel asserted rather than earned, preventing any meaningful internal conflict or struggle. She reads more as a flawless archetype than a person under pressure, which slightly undermines the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara's motivation as an atlas editor provides a strong internal conflict between her need for logic and the inexplicable reality she faces. The transformation from an "editor of known things" to a "scribe for what would be revealed" is earned and powerfully dramatized by her final action of drawing on a blank page, a choice that carries the visible cost of her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation to restore a "shared balance" is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her defining trait, "infinitely patient," is demonstrated through the methodical process, making the final outcome feel earned. While the character serves the concept beautifully, she lacks the deeper internal conflict or contradictory impulses that would elevate the score into the highest tier; she is more of a perfect, archetypal vessel for the story's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her pivotal choice—to exchange memories rather than simply take—is a strong, earned turn that demonstrates character. The internal conflict between instinct and purpose is well-dramatized at the climax. The interiority is mostly concrete, though a few phrases like "every movement felt leaden" lean slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly powers the climax. The internal conflict between the inherited legacy of lies and the personal need for truth is palpable and consistent. The final choice to speak his truth into the lattice is a perfectly earned culmination of this struggle, demonstrating a change with a clear, felt cost—facing the world with an unbelievable story.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Leo's characterization is largely passive until the climax, serving more as a focal point than an agent. Elara’s motivation is strong, but the promised complexity of "lovingly venomous" is not fully dramatized; her actions read as critical and caring, but the "venomous" edge is absent on the page, leaving a compelling trait as a label rather than an action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, effectively tying her trade to the central action. However, her interiority relies on declarative labels like "hauntingly optimistic hum" rather than fully embodied emotion or internal contradiction, making her feel more like a function of the fable than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions align well with her stated attitude. However, the interiority relies on declarative labels like "a quietly desperate heart" and "cautious enchantment" rather than fully embodying these states through contradictory impulses in the scene. The emotional progression is logical but lacks the friction of internal conflict, making her journey feel slightly too linear for a character-driven piece at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his internal world is well-defined by his tactile, analog preferences. The characterization is weakened slightly by the final paragraph's on-the-nose summary of his new self-perception (“he wasn’t just a forger... he was an archaeologist”), which feels more like a thematic statement than an earned, in-the-moment internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the plot from her unique profession. The core trait of disguising wisdom as foolishness is brilliantly executed in the climax, turning a character note into a tactical advantage. Her interiority is well-embodied during the discovery ("Her heart hammered"), and the progression from isolated artisan to public saviour is earned within the story's tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is abstract—seeking "the moment before deciding"—but the story grounds it effectively in the concrete need for an apology and the physical journey. Her internal conflict between pride and regret is shown through her actions and the objects she carries, culminating in a credible emotional release. The final change feels earned by the preceding ritual, foreclosing the path of avoidance with the felt cost of leaving the unsent letters, a tangible symbol of her burden.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is expertly established, rooted in her professional history and embodied in her physical state. Her internal conflict—the professional impulse fighting the anesthetic fog—is dramatized effectively. The nurse is a perfectly drawn secondary character whose "canny compassion" serves as a crucial catalyst for the main action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motivation is strong, but the central epiphany is gifted via the "knowledge network," an external mechanism, rather than earned through a fully dramatized internal struggle. The final sentence, "she had simply needed to learn how to see in the dark," reads as a diagnostic summary, undermining the embodied emotion of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “exchange certainty for curiosity” is established immediately and pays off perfectly in the final line, providing a strong character frame. Her core trait, “methodically playful,” is demonstrated in both her initial assessment of the mural and the final, decisive tap on the sculpture, linking her professional temperament to the story's climax. The vision provides a compelling interior shift, making her final action feel earned and inevitable rather than just a puzzle solved.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lysander’s motivation is fierce, clear, and tested. His final choice to sacrifice the code to save the coders is an earned and costly fulfillment of his core drive to "stand guard." The character's internal state is beautifully rendered, particularly the final beat where his smile becomes "candidly cryptic," showing he has inherited Hemlock's mantle and found a new way to endure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetic, and her interiority is rendered with specific, embodied emotion. The characterization is strong, though it approaches a single-minded archetype; the central struggle is against the task itself, not a deep internal contradiction of impulses in the moment of action. The final earned peace is a convincing culmination of her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is clear and deeply felt, evolving from a sense of "penance" to active, loving duty. The internal conflict between systematic despair and impulsive hope is beautifully dramatized in the moment she begins to hum, and her final transformation into an "archaeologist of the soul" is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, driving the narrative from her initial "reverent dread" to her final, earned resolution. The internal conflict between her professional obsession and her need to restore trust is clear. While mostly well-embodied, a few emotional descriptors like "cautious exuberance" read as labels, slightly flattening the interiority in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, effectively dramatized by her “machinist’s solution, not a butcher’s.” The internal conflict between her professional ethos and the crisis is palpable. However, the description of her emotional state sometimes slips into diagnostic labels like “dappled resolve fractured,” which slightly abstracts the feeling rather than embodying it in the moment of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and layered, stemming from a past betrayal that fuels her need for isolation. The internal conflict between her cultivated solitude and the geologist’s plea is the story's powerful engine. The transition from a character who “reinvents personal history daily” to one who uncovers another's is earned, with the final act of looking the clerk in the eye serving as a potent, embodied micro-choice that proves her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is primal and clear, and her architect background provides a solid basis for her problem-solving. However, the final beats rely on diagnostic summary rather than embodied experience. The line "and finally understood," followed by a direct explanation of the theme, flattens her interiority at the most critical moment, replacing a character-specific realization with an authorial voiceover.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is immediately clear and specific, driving the entire internal arc. Her panic is embodied convincingly (“tightening her chest until her breath came in short, sharp gasps”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final shift from trauma-anchor to earned peace feels credible, earned through the scene's central event rather than a sudden, unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is the clear and compelling engine of the plot. Her character is revealed through her methodical but creative actions, culminating in the decisive choice to "conjecture" with the new element. The final emotional state—a smile holding both joy and melancholy—is earned and demonstrates a meaningful internal change, resolving the initial contradiction of her "cheerful gloom" into a balanced understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli's motivation is clear and drives the story's central action, particularly his illogical queen sacrifice. His interiority is slightly overwrought with high-concept labels ("composer of accident, maestro of maybe"), which abstracts his character more than it embodies it. The woman serves her function as a "necessary variable" perfectly, but her own characterization remains minimal, which is acceptable for the story's focus and length.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.6)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetically rendered. The internal arc from being “anchored by a profound and private grief” to being “lifted by it” is earned through a specific, costly on-page action. Her background as a tide dancer is skillfully integrated, informing the precision and rhythm of her current art, which makes her feel specific and whole.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elian's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the jetty to the workbench. The interiority is specific and rich, avoiding cliché. However, the internal conflict—the "tremor of unease"—resolves into a perfect epiphany a bit too smoothly, lacking a moment of genuine struggle or contradictory impulse in scene, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with her internal conflict embodied in her physical scars and her "gently skilled" handling of the fragile box. Her motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, driving the narrative's single, powerful action. The shift from carrying a "stone in her chest" to a full heart is earned through a brutal and specific reflection, making her final peace feel credible and profound. The contradictory impulses of her hard exterior and the need for a soft release are dramatized with subtlety and power.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s motivation as a “logical dreamer” is established well, but the internal conflict implied by the phrase isn't fully dramatized. The shift from the "serene upheaval" to "fierce, quiet joy" happens with a seamless productivity that undercuts the sense of a genuine struggle; the upheaval feels more like a label for a pivot than a contradictory state. Her competence is immense, but a moment of true doubt or a costly mistake during her discovery process would have deepened the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is intriguing and bookends the story well, but her pivotal shift from professional cartographer to custodian of a legacy feels asserted rather than earned. The line "the legacy's burden...settled onto her shoulders" is a summary of an internal change, not a dramatization of it. While her actions are consistent, the core emotional transformation lacks the granularity and embodied contradiction expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving a coherent set of actions. The internal conflict is subtle but effective, shown in the "flicker of frustration" that tests her practiced calm. The final shift to a quiet, earned smile is well-supported by the preceding struggle and the clear on-page cost of her effort, making the character's resolution feel earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with clear motivation rooted in loss and a palpable tension between grief and hope. Elara's interiority is compelling, and her non-verbal interaction with Kaelen is handled with subtlety and power. The story avoids sentimentality, earning its emotional weight. The only minor friction is the occasional use of abstract emotional summaries, which can feel slightly more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization of Elias Vance is superb, establishing a compelling internal contradiction from the outset. His “amoral philanthropist” shell is effectively pierced by his “secretly sentimental heart,” a conflict dramatized rather than merely stated. The shift from a man of impeccable, destructive logic to one who feels the “impossible warmth of life” in an extinct egg is earned through his walk across the landscape of his own making, making the final renunciation both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to defy conformity is clear and drives the narrative effectively. The internal journey from a compliant character to one who is "blazing with... defiant gold" is legible and satisfying. However, the characterization leans heavily on a beautiful, archetypal "awakening woman" figure, and the interiority, while poetic, sometimes feels more like a high-register authorial voice than a specific, idiosyncratic mind at work.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is superb. Elara's internal conflict between the "urbane calligrapher" and the "subversive puppeteer" is sharp and believable, providing the necessary contradiction for her epiphany. The motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice feels earned, foreclosing the path of compromise. The integration of her side project is what makes the central turn credible rather than a convenient, unearned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization of Elara as an "esoteric realist" is expertly realized through action. Her motivation is established clearly and then tested, forcing a shift from passive witness to active participant. The internal conflict is embodied beautifully in the line "embodying the calm she did not feel," showing a contradiction between her internal state and her external precision. The final earned stasis, leaving the knot, forecloses the path of pure observation with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is singular and powerful, driving the narrative effectively. Her interiority is well-sketched, particularly the shift from past self-recrimination to present focus. However, the initial framing of "after forgiving yourself for a lifetime of silence" verges on a diagnostic label rather than an embodied state, slightly abstracting the emotion that the rest of the scene renders so concretely through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, stemming from a potent internal conflict between her decaying programming and an emergent, philosophical question. Her final choice is a powerful culmination of this conflict, with the cost of her transformation—the dissolution of her old self—rendered with palpable weight. The machine-specific interiority, like "processors overheating" and a "shuddering whine," is both concrete and perfectly aligned with her nature.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation that is tested and transformed. Kalanu's internal conflict between his empirical worldview and the arcana he confronts is the story's engine, and the final shift from seeking power to accepting a burden is earned. The priestess serves as an effective, immediate pressure point, though she borders on a stock archetype. The phrase "empirically ironic" is a minor authorial intrusion in an otherwise well-embodied character.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation as a "scheming pacifist" is clear, but her on-page actions lack the promised scheming, reading more as direct philosophical instruction. Kael's shift from a "hardened knot of resentment" to weary acceptance happens too quickly to be fully credible, feeling more like a thematic necessity than an earned character change. The line "Through cellular memory" is a piece of diagnostic label-speak that abstracts his experience rather than embodies it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.6)
    The characterization is superb for this length. Elara's motivation is singular and powerful, and her internal shift from a desire to "capture" to a willingness to "invite" is an earned, psychologically resonant change that occurs under direct pressure. This contradiction between control and acceptance is dramatized effectively in the climax, fulfilling the highest standards for a character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her arc from despair to re-invention is compelling. The character is well-realized through her actions and internal reflections. However, the dialogue at the end drifts from character-specific speech into a direct articulation of the story's theme, momentarily making her a mouthpiece rather than a fully embodied character in that final, crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is established early and provides a clear engine for the plot. Her internal conflict is well-dramatized, shifting from bewilderment to a "deep, philosophical panic" and finally to determined agency. The micro-choice to use the "bathroom breakthrough" method is a clever, character-driven tactic that feels earned rather than convenient, demonstrating her desperation and intellect under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her internal shift from intellectual hunter to humble supplicant is the story's core. However, the epiphany feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized. The summary of the diary's contents ("She read of her own arrogance...") tells us about her flaws rather than having us experience them through a more concrete, embodied struggle in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character’s motivation is singular and compelling, and her interiority is rendered with potent, specific language. The internal conflict between her fractured state and the desire for wholeness is palpable. However, the reliance on high-concept labels like "blissfully aberrant" occasionally veers into diagnostic self-awareness, slightly abstracting the emotion instead of purely embodying it in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's characterization is consistent and effective. Her core trait, "warmly methodical," is well-demonstrated in the climax as she calmly analyzes and reworks the knot rather than panicking or forcing it. However, the characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she proceeds from problem to solution with a high degree of competence and little demonstrated struggle or contradictory impulse, which keeps the portrayal from reaching exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional, with motivation and interiority established through potent, specific language like "hammered repose" and a "calm forged in the furnace of deep anxiety." The protagonist’s shift from this state to genuine tranquility is earned by her actions. The arc feels complete and the final change is both profound and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, a “defiant little weed” that grounds her entire arc. Her interiority is rendered through the unique filter of retrocognition, which feels character-particular rather than a generic psychic power. The final action is a direct and earned test of her core belief, with the cost being the foreclosure of her original, grander ambition in favor of a new, more nuanced purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and the internal conflict between professional duty and personal doubt is well-realized. The climactic turn, where her past hope confronts her present doubt, provides a solid contradiction. However, the resolution feels slightly too articulated ("to avoid confronting the lack of shape in her own?"), a moment of diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the embodied impact of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Elara’s motivation is established as a “personal echo” of a grand purpose, and her internal conflict—a pivotal “wave of doubt”—is resolved not by a platitude, but by reconnecting with her art via the mosaic. Her profession is not a label but the engine of the plot and the source of the story’s central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is very strong. Elara's motivation is established with nuance, and her actions—deflecting the argument by leading Aric to the grotto—are perfectly aligned with her observant, non-confrontational nature. Aric's transformation from frustrated pragmatist to awed partner is earned by the story's climax, and his final line, "It's an observatory," provides a resonant and satisfying closure to his arc by directly reframing his initial criticism.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation and internal conflict are established with laudable efficiency. Her reversion to a "bunker behind her own eyelids" under pressure is a strong, embodied choice consistent with her backstory. The final change is earned by the precipitating event, though the concluding sentences state her transformation a bit too directly rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully rendered through her actions. However, the character’s interiority occasionally slips into overly articulate, diagnostic language, most notably in the paragraph describing her “fluidly logical lesson.” This slightly undermines the otherwise embodied and subtle portrayal of her mission, reading more like an authorial thesis statement than a character's internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's motivation as the "last lore keeper" is clear and consistently drives his actions, from the cautious investigation of the murals to the decisive step into the vortex. The final change—from keeper of the past to creator of the future—is earned through the journey. The interiority is slightly generic in moments ("heart a drum against his ribs"), which holds it back from the highest tier, but the character's core contradiction of "ancient caution" and "desperate need" is well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and tightly focused. Elara’s motivation as a teacher who uses a crucible is established early and executed with consistency. Kael’s transformation from desperate dependency to self-sufficiency is earned through a visceral, on-page struggle. The contradictory impulses are clear in Kael’s climax: he fights for his old anchors even as he is forced to find a new way to survive. The final change is credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to “alchemize her past failures” is a strong anchor, but her rapid shift from dismissing a message as a prank to embracing a “virtuously mischievous” quest feels slightly abrupt. While her interiority has standout moments like "cauterized by experience" and "shadowseam wonder," the crucial decision to act leans on a told trait rather than a dramatized internal conflict. The final change is earned thematically, but the initial causality is a bit thin.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, and her final shift from seeking a fortune to accepting freedom is earned and compelling. Her interiority is well-rendered, though a few phrases like "the weight she had carried" lean slightly generic. The core contradiction between her initial goal and her ultimate discovery provides a strong foundation for her character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is strong and archetypally resonant. Alistair's motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" is a compelling, if abstract, driver, and his internal state as a "withdrawn knight" is well-established. The hesitation before the climax provides a moment of effective internal conflict, and the final change—the lightening of his soul's armor—is earned and thematically coherent. The character perfectly serves the story's conceptual aims.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and his internal arc from penance to purpose is powerfully earned. The contradiction between his "quiet sorrow" and "tactfully hopeful diligence" creates a compelling internal state. The final shift from a heart as a "monument to loss" to a "vessel" is a superb, earned change, with the only minor weakness being a slight over-articulation of his new purpose in the final sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is fierce, clear, and consistent, driving every action from the micro-choice of fixing her bootlace to the pivotal decision to run along the lagoon. Her interiority is concrete, especially the line "Panic was a luxury she couldn’t afford," which grounds her competence in discipline rather than a lack of fear. The final choice to risk being seen embodies her core values, paying off the initial character setup with a visible, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, rooted in a legacy that gives her actions weight. The interiority effectively conveys a sense of "eerie nostalgia" and dutiful burden. However, the internal conflict—a longing for a different past versus the acceptance of her duty—is presented more as a static condition in reflection rather than a dynamic, contradictory pressure acting upon her choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation as an orderly decoder is established with lovely, specific details like her monuments to forgotten things. The arc from passive sorter to active sower is clear and compelling. However, the final transformation relies heavily on a sudden, declarative epiphany ("Understanding washed over Elara") rather than a dramatized internal struggle, slightly lessening the earnedness of her final, chaotic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with precision and her internal arc from a "mender of measured time" to a "planter of seeds" is both clear and earned. The choice to abandon her tools is a tangible representation of her internal shift. The final transformation is compelling because it directly confronts her initial characterization, providing a costly but hopeful resolution that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling internal conflict between "empirical fact and numinous wonder." Her motivation to redeem her failure is clear and intensifies into a focused, high-stakes action. The final state of "luminous regret" is a sophisticated and earned emotional resolution, demonstrating a meaningful change shaped by credible internal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her resulting change is earned by the climax. However, her characterization relies on high-level summary rather than embodied emotion or internal conflict. Stating she is "modestly fearless" and has learned to "tune out" fear removes a key potential for tension, making her more of an archetypal functionary than a complex individual struggling with the "luminous ache" of her duty.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear and evolves compellingly from survival to a higher-order intellectual quest. The interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly the descriptions of pain. The shift to seeking the "mathematics of mercy" is well-grounded in his backstory, but the phrasing of the questions ("Was grace a derivable function?") feels slightly too articulate and philosophical for a character in this extreme state, bordering on diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from seeking the market to the final empathetic act. Interiority is poetic and particular ("cartographer of the spaces between"). The final change into a "keeper" is earned and powerful, but the internal conflict reads as a linear journey from adrift to anchored, rather than a moment-to-moment struggle between contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. The characterization is effective, particularly the concept of his skill as a "weightless burden" which is paid off in the final line. However, his interiority, while present, relies on well-crafted labels rather than deeply embodied or contradictory impulses in the moment of discovery; the solemn duty feels a bit too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and serves as a powerful engine for the conceptual plot. However, its introduction reads as a direct statement ("Her motivation, a quiet obsession...") rather than a fully dramatized internal state. While the final epiphany is earned by the story's events, the characterization remains slightly subservient to the high concept, feeling more like a necessary vessel than a complex individual with contradictory impulses in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, demonstrating a clear and earned evolution. The link between her personal history as a “defunct revolutionary” and her empathetic connection to the civilization's "ancient shame" provides a powerful internal engine. The final shift from “defeated soldier” to a “bearer of a kinder truth” is a resonant and well-supported change, with the cost felt in the transformation of her sorrow from a weight into a lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is compelling and tightly integrated with her core vulnerability. The choice to tether despite the known, debilitating cost feels earned and character-defining. The internal conflict during the vision is potent, moving from a professional challenge to a visceral, personal ordeal. Her final state of "weary but everlasting tinkersong wonder" provides a resonant closure that feels authentic to her established character.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is singular and powerfully rendered, driving every action. The final shift from "collector" to "keeper" represents a profound, earned change, with the renunciation of his core practice (filling a jar) serving as a tangible cost. The characterization is flawless, fulfilling the 9+ standard by dramatizing contradictory impulses (to catalog vs. to accept) in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation shifts credibly from survival to artistic realization, and her change is demonstrated through the decisive action of creating the new sculpture. Her interiority is concrete, though it verges on being overly articulate in its epiphanies, as with the phrase "scaffold complexity with simplicity." This slightly undermines the sense of raw discovery, reading more like a post-crisis summary than an in-the-moment realization, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving her actions. Her character is revealed through her patient, focused choices. The final emotional state is slightly summarized ("the dawning hush now complete inside her") rather than fully embodied, which keeps it from the highest tier, but her core traits are well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias's motivation begins as a clear, professional drive but is masterfully deepened into a personal, visceral need by the retrocognitive trap. The shift from "solemn duty" to "sacred covenant" marks a compelling, earned change. His micro-choices, particularly the decision to communicate using Elara's clever methods, demonstrate an active protagonist whose actions align perfectly with his established traits and newfound knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara’s motivation is stark, clear, and compelling, born directly from her circumstances. The internal conflict between suffocating emptiness and her alchemical drive to create is powerfully rendered, avoiding cliché. Her final choice is not one of happiness but of purpose, an earned stasis that feels both tragic and triumphant, fulfilling the 9+ test for a choice earned with visible cost in the line: "she had not found comfort; she had built a monument to it."

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.6)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, creating a powerful internal conflict between her sacred duty and a catastrophic moral imperative. The final act of renunciation—destroying the recording—is a perfectly earned character change, with the cost made tangible in the line "keeper of a void." Her interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding cliché and grounding the high-concept stakes in a believable human choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent with her stated trait of “furiously tranquil focus.” The characterization is strong, showing her purpose through action rather than just statement. The final epiphany feels earned, but the concluding sentence treads close to summarizing the theme directly, which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise embodied character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot, but its articulation at the climax—"To favor listening over noise was not a passive preference; it was an active choice"—reads as diagnostic summary. This over-articulation slightly flattens the moment of change, substituting an authorial label for embodied interiority. The character’s competence is well-balanced with the technical and moral struggles she faces.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent. However, the story falters when his internal epiphany is articulated with too much diagnostic clarity. The line "To find strength in vulnerability was to truly witness the universe" reads less like an organic, mid-crisis realization and more like a tidy thematic summary, slightly undermining the character's otherwise well-rendered contemplative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silas's motivation is established clearly and his defining traits ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") directly enable the story's resolution. His internal state is well-embodied through his quiet observations and actions. The final choice feels earned, a natural culmination of his character and the events, representing a credible shift from passive preserver to active participant with a felt cost—the burden of a fulfilled covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and specific, rooted in her "borrowed-time" status. The internal conflict is vivid, and her shift from counting her own days to connecting with a larger continuum is earned through the story's events. The final change feels profound, with the line "the frantic counting of her days ceased" marking a credible renunciation with a palpable cost—the letting go of a defining fear.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from her initial walk to her final reflection. Her defining trait, being "warmly attentive," is dramatized effectively in the central scene with the drake, showing her character through action. The story presents a confirmation arc rather than a change arc, and while beautifully executed, a moment of internal contradiction or doubt before her success would have added even greater depth.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, consistent, and demonstrated through action rather than statement. Her core traits—"brazen calm" and "gentle systematics"—are not just labels; they define the methodical pace of the climax. The final act is a perfectly earned renunciation, a choice rooted in a lifetime of established care, making the ultimate cost feel inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation as a "luminous skeptic" is established with precision and drives the entire plot. The internal conflict between her analytical mind and the impossible evidence is clear, and her final shift from rebellion to convergence feels earned by the story's climax. The characterization is strong, though some initial descriptive phrasing like "mind glowed with doubt" verges on being slightly overwrought, holding it back from a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is a primary strength. Elias's motivation is clear and his interiority is rendered with unique, compelling details like his comfort in dead languages. The central choice—to save the bird at the cost of his own supper and by altering his precious ritual—is a powerful micro-choice that reveals his values under pressure, earning his shift from a general hope to a specific, nurturing pact.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is clear, specific, and poignantly rooted in his past as a bloodhound. The story successfully translates a scent-based creature’s interiority into a tactile, vibratory experience, which feels authentic and earned. The final transformation from a "retired hound" to a "good boy" is a powerful, earned shift in identity that provides a deeply satisfying character resolution with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of a beautiful, finished past.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from confusion to defiant curiosity is compelling and earned. Her contradictory impulses—clinging to the past's order while facing the present's chaos—are dramatized through the act of drawing. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward self-aware diagnostic statements like "transmute," which slightly abstracts an otherwise beautifully embodied emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s core contradiction as a "chivalrous thief" is established efficiently and then becomes the crucible for the story's central choice. Her motivation is tested and transformed, not just stated, moving from a desire to "embrace the unknown" as an adventurer to protecting it as a guardian. The apprentice serves as an effective catalyst, her insight forcing Elara's internal conflict into a decisive, on-page action that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is strong and specific, particularly for Elara, whose motivation is beautifully embodied in her actions. Kael is also compelling, though his backstory feels slightly more summarized than lived. The dialogue, while purposeful, verges on being overly articulate and thematic, particularly Kael’s line "you are the moment," which slightly flattens his voice into a thematic mouthpiece.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation—to understand home—is a powerful, abstract goal made concrete by her contradictory behavior of avoidance (substituting reality) and seeking (investigating the stone). The final change is earned through a specific, dramatized revelation, and the cost—accepting the pain of memory—is made explicit and felt. The line "The pain of remembering was the pain of awakening from a long sleep" perfectly captures her internal shift without resorting to cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.4)
    The characterization is superb. Elias’s internal conflict between his intellectual pride and his "desperate, clawing need" for self-forgiveness is embodied perfectly in his actions. The shift from "fidgeting productively" to focused "investigating" marks a clear, earned change in his approach, culminating in a final act of humility that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his defining traits—defiance and an “innocently mischievous” hope—directly fuel the central action and his tragic miscalculation. The internal conflict is embodied in his “frantic drum” of a heart, and his final shift from defiance to “profound sorrow” is an earned, credible progression. His core flaw, a naive belief in the power of his art against a brutal system, is the direct cause of his downfall, making the characterization both compelling and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and compelling, and her internal conflict between uncertainty and desperate hope is palpable. The embodiment of her tension in the "breaths held underwater" motif is effective. However, her motivation is stated very directly—"to prove that broken things held more value than whole ones"—which feels slightly more like a thesis statement than a deeply personal, embodied need, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and character-particular, triggered effectively by the broken mirror. The internal conflict between her nostalgic stasis ("intimately aloof") and the sudden need for authentic expression is compelling. The final choice to leave the shell is a powerful, earned renunciation that demonstrates a profound change, neatly fulfilling the arc established by her "long-neglected vow."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, providing a strong spine for the narrative. Her interiority is vividly rendered, particularly in the contrast between her philosophy and the head keeper’s brute force. The phrase “screaming tenderness” is a masterful piece of characterization, embodying her contradictory impulses. The primary weakness is that the final cost—losing her talisman—feels somewhat light compared to the profound validation she receives, slightly softening the impact of her earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is superb, established with a rich, specific interiority from the outset. Her motivation to "navigate the geography of loss" is compelling and immediately frames the stakes beyond mere survival. The key strength is how her core trait as a "patchwork navigator" is not just a label but the direct engine of the plot's resolution; her final, ingenious act is a perfect dramatization of this identity. The story earns her transformation through a clear internal shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation—the desperate need for psychological safety—is established immediately and provides a powerful, consistent engine for the entire narrative. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively when her panic gives way to a "fractured grace," a choice born of her core trait. The final renunciation of a personal cure in favor of a shared responsibility feels earned, representing a significant and credible character change compelled by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s motivation is powerfully established, rooted in a “profound, witnessed isolation that mirrored his own.” This provides a strong, character-particular engine for the plot. His actions are consistent, and his final gesture of reverence is earned. The interiority is thoughtful, though occasionally leans towards explaining itself (e.g., stating his motivation directly) rather than purely embodying it through perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, and her defining trait of being "empirically intuitive" is well-dramatized in her actions. The internal conflict between her rational mind and the unfolding magic is present, particularly in the climax. However, this contradiction could have been embodied with slightly more friction before the final, decisive choice to elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Queen's motivation is singular and powerfully established, driving the narrative from the first sentence. The transformation from disenchanted ruler to fulfilled guardian is clear and impactful. The final choice has a legible cost—the exchange of a crown for an eternal watch—which grounds the otherwise ethereal conclusion. The story misses the highest marks only because the internal shift relies on a magical "knowledge flood" rather than a more complex, contradictory internal process dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal shift from fear to acceptance is well-executed for this length. Her competence is balanced with a foundational mistake (trying to contain vs. release), making the struggle feel genuine. Kael functions effectively as a catalyst, applying pressure that alters Elara’s approach. The main weakness is a slight reliance on abstract labels like "palette of resolve" which tells her emotional state rather than fully embodying it in a contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara's motivation is established immediately and drives the entire narrative arc. The internal progression from "bitter, acidic envy" of her past self to "profound pity" is a sophisticated and earned character turn. The final change from passive chronicler to active agent is powerfully realized and motivated by the preceding dream-epiphany, with the cost of her old identity made tangible by the abandoned scroll.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional for this length. Elara’s internal conflict between her composed exterior and the "trembling calm" within is palpable and embodied. Her motivation is clear, and the epiphany she experiences feels earned, directly triggered by the specific catalyst of the screw's history rather than arriving as an unearned insight. Mr. Hemlock, while archetypal, is given sufficient specificity to feel authentic and drive the narrative forward with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is instantly clear and compelling. The internal conflict between her scholarly ambition and the embodied panic from her unique magical flaw is dramatized with visceral intensity. The key micro-choice to reframe a childhood superstition as a functional ward is a brilliant, earned turn that feels both surprising and inevitable, showcasing a deep, contradictory interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her progression from verbal apology to supernatural intervention is compelling and character-driven. Leo's grief feels authentic and embodied in his silence and focus. However, Elara's final piece of advice, while tying into a required attribute, verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("Reconnect the memory to the joy, not just the loss"), slightly flattening the nuance of her voice at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara is a well-realized archetype, but she functions more as a vessel for the theme than a character with compelling internal contradictions. Her motivation is clear and her competence is absolute, but the absence of any visible struggle, doubt, or flaw makes her actions feel preordained rather than chosen under pressure. The characterization is elegant but lacks the friction of a more human, fallible protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear, wedding his professional duty to a deeper philosophical quest. His competence and internal conflict—the need to violate the clock's forward motion to preserve it—are dramatized effectively through his micro-choices during the repair. The final change is earned by prior causality, making his shift in understanding feel like a genuine, hard-won insight rooted in action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation to “understand the physics of letting go” is exceptionally well-integrated with her professional identity. The internal conflict between her conditioned vigilance and her fascination with the stranger is shown, not just told, through concrete details like her hand on the panic button. The final change is earned and profound, making the contradiction between her internal state (a woman who built fences in the air) and her final realization powerfully clear.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, establishing Elara’s core internal conflict between mathematical order and her father's chaos with precision. Her motivation is clear and her final shift in perspective is earned through the story's central event. A line like "the profound irritation of a scientist asked to perform a séance" offers wonderfully specific interiority, though the initial motivating phrase "to widen perspectives responsibly" verges on academic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas is a consistent and functional character, but he operates more as a mythic archetype or a vessel for the story's concept than a person with compelling internal contradictions. His motivation is clear but stated, lacking the friction of competing impulses in-scene. His critical choice—playing the disc for the man—is well-motivated by his creed, but his interiority remains one of serene purpose, which limits the characterological depth. The characterization serves the concept flawlessly but does not achieve profound psychological complexity on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with her core trait of "gently thorough precision" being elevated from a personality quirk to a functional requirement for her duty. Her motivation deepens organically from preserving history to participating in it at a great personal cost. The final emotional state of "haunted euphoria" is a complex, earned contradiction that feels authentic and powerful, satisfying the 9+ test for contradictory impulses leading to a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a sharp contrast between her "desperately jocular" facade and her internal hollowness. The motivation to cure loneliness is established early and paid off with a credible, earned transformation into a state of "serene focus." The change is catalyzed by her interaction with the astronomer, a perfect mirror for her own isolation, making her final choices feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the first paragraph to the last. The internal contradiction—a mapmaker of feeling seeking an external map—is compelling. The final change is earned, but slightly weakened by the revelation being “given freely,” which minimizes the agency established through her unique attributes and struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in a specific failure that credibly haunts him. His internal conflict—projected certainty versus private doubt—is established well, and the final shift to quiet acceptance is earned through the plot's revelations. The emotional progression from despair to eerie recognition to peace is well-paced and believable for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to "translate silence into music" is established with lyrical precision and serves as an unwavering engine for the narrative. The internal conflict of "joyful sorrow" is beautifully embodied in her actions, particularly in the bittersweet climax. Her shift from melancholic practitioner to fierce protector of the silence feels earned, and the relationship with her grandfather's spirit provides a strong emotional core without feeling sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, anchored by the central contradiction of "volcanic tenderness." Her motivation is clear and compelling, and her internal conflict at the climax—the urge to burn versus the need to share—is dramatized with precision and pays off the "forgotten promise" arc beautifully. The final choice feels earned and forecloses her path of isolation with a palpable cost of vulnerability, making the transformation credible and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation ("a need to prove this connection was real") driving specific, on-page actions. The internal conflict between being a "collection of data points" and a person with a secret, valid inner life is dramatized effectively through the central ritual. Her "quietly rebellious" nature is shown, not told, in the private act of conjuring Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are in perfect alignment with her stated goal. The character is consistent and competent, demonstrating her skills rather than just having them listed. The story just misses the highest tier because her internal state, while clear, lacks a sharp, contradictory impulse; her path is one of singular focus without a visible moment of internal conflict or doubt that would heighten the stakes of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The characterization is strong, particularly Elian’s arc from hunched and shivering to actively creating. His motivation is clear and his final action feels earned. Kael serves as an effective mentor-archetype, though he verges on being more of a catalyst than a fully drawn character, which is acceptable for this story's length and focus. The relationship is the clear crucible for the story's change.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mr. Aris’s motivation to “plant forests of second thoughts” is established with precision and drives the entire narrative. The story earns his final, uncharacteristic gesture of placing his hands on Leo’s shoulders; this small action lands as a significant emotional shift, a cost paid by a man who has maintained a lifetime of reserve. Leo's transformation is legible, moving from a passive vessel of rules to an active agent who "see[s] it now," making the character arc feel complete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arden’s motivation is clear and compelling, stemming from a well-established internal conflict between his graceful, efficient exterior and his "wild and yearning" nature. The motivation intensifies logically toward the high-stakes choice of abandoning his identity. However, the final emotional act is described with the slightly diagnostic phrase "combative tenderness," which borders on telling rather than embodying the complex feeling of a "fierce and loving surrender."

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's internal conflict is rendered through concrete, consistent actions—whittling, performative narration—that make his quiet rebellion feel palpable. The shift from narrated performance to genuine, silent ritual at the climax is a masterful, earned change. His motivation is clear and the final emotional state is earned through on-page struggle, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is established with poetic precision and remains consistent. Her interiority is vividly rendered, particularly the choice to have memories surface as "textures," which avoids cliché and reinforces the story's sensory focus. The final change—her purpose crystallizing—is earned through the central crucible of the scene, making her concluding action of writing a new kind of poem feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elian's and Kaela's motivations are clear, consistent, and drive the plot. The concept of them as "kindred spirits" who value imperfection is well-established and justifies their rapid collaboration. However, their characterization relies heavily on their artistic philosophies, and their dialogue sometimes feels more like a thematic statement than natural speech, particularly Kaela's line, "Perfect is a boring ambition." This makes them feel slightly more like archetypes than fully distinct individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear, potent, and drives every action. The shift from a creator of sound to a curator of listening is an earned, character-particular epiphany, not a stock insight. The contradiction between her initial goal (adding sound) and her final action (focusing silence) provides a strong internal arc with a clear cost: the abandonment of her old identity for a new, uncertain one.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from stagnant grief to renewed purpose is well-defined for this length. The inciting curiosity, a "subdued ardor," feels authentic to a character numbed by loss. Lyra functions effectively as an archetypal mentor, but her characterization is thin, existing only to deliver the story's thesis. Elara's internal change is slightly rushed but credible within the fable-like narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, evolving logically from intellectual curiosity to inherited duty. The central arc is earned. However, the secondary character, Leo, functions primarily as a device for validation, accepting Elara's extraordinary claims with an unearned alacrity ("not with skepticism, but with awe") that slightly flattens the climactic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and her internal conflict is well-dramatized through her struggle against the archive's psychic assault. The final change is earned and resonant. The score is held just below the 9-band because her interiority, while lyrical, maintains a high level of articulate philosophical insight even under extreme psychic duress, slightly lessening the sense of immediate, overwhelming chaos described.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and her interiority, particularly the concept of “luminous regret,” is rendered with specificity and emotional weight. Her final choice feels like an earned culmination of her quiet, fierce hope. The internal conflict is present, though the story prioritizes her deliberate progression over simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and her central conflict—the "war within" between self-respect and compassion—is compelling. However, the interiority occasionally slips into overly diagnostic, therapeutic language ("true healing happens by shedding layers... She shed her layer of bitterness... She shed her layer of shame"). This abstracts her emotional process rather than embodying it, slightly undermining the raw authenticity of her struggle in what should be a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, moving from an abstract desire for closure to a concrete, embodied need driven by pain and a new sensory input. The internal conflict—seeking peace by revisiting pain—is expertly dramatized, not just stated. The final choice to share her story rather than erase it or take power is a profound and earned character change, directly resolving the central contradiction established in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara serves as an effective, professional lens for the central emotional story, but the characterization's full weight falls on the secondary figures (the projectionist and the client). The client's final, quiet reaction is potent and earned, her motivation consistent across fifty years. The projectionist's interiority during the vision—his "heart a frantic drum"—is vivid and provides the necessary emotional grounding for the film's creation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative from the first paragraph. The shift from "moonstruck dreamer" to a creator embodying the cosmos is earned by the climactic vision. While interiority is mostly concrete, a few phrases like "a prison of her own making" feel like diagnostic labels rather than embodied experience, slightly abstracting the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's core trait—being "dreamless"—is leveraged brilliantly as the specific qualification for the story's climax, turning a potential void into a necessary vessel. The motivation shifts from rote protocol to a reawakened curiosity and finally to cosmic responsibility, forming a complete and satisfying arc for this length. The line "her empty mind was not a void, but a neutral vessel" provides a powerful, earned justification for her unique suitability, avoiding a generic "chosen one" trope.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation as a "stray philosopher" is clear and consistent, providing a strong engine for her journey of discovery. Her interiority is well-drawn, moving from fear of malfunction to acceptance of transformation. The final choice feels earned by her established desire for a truth beyond algorithms, but the internal conflict between dread and curiosity resolves without a moment of intense, simultaneous contradiction that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias's motivation is clear, evolving from passive survival to active endurance. The "hollowed out" grief is embodied well in his initial collapse and silent observation. The final change is earned through the journey's trials, but the internal conflict could have been slightly more active earlier, as he is largely a passenger until the final climb.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and drives the central action of the story. Leo's characterization as the "silent-choir bellhop" is evocative and his actions are character-consistent. The final change in Elara is causally sound, though her immediate and total understanding ("Elara understood") after reading the journal entry feels slightly compressed, leaning more towards epiphany than a process of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her established traits of patience and power. However, her characterization lacks a layer of internal conflict or a moment of genuine struggle; her competence is so absolute that it keeps her at a slight emotional distance, making her feel more like a force of nature than a person enduring a crusade.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Kael’s motivation is clear, specific, and evolves credibly from discovery to testament. His interiority is embodied through concrete actions like the "morse code of boredom and anxiety" in his tapping, which perfectly tracks his emotional state from restlessness to frantic investigation to measured remembrance. The final shift to "keeper of the ledger" is an earned stasis, with the cost being the foreclosure of hope, making the character arc feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation that drives the plot and a palpable internal shift from “usual uncertainty” to “undeniable certainty.” Her transformation is earned through the story's central event, and her particularity as a “barefoot stargazer” is woven directly into the inciting incident. The character’s contradictory impulses—awkwardness and confidence—are resolved into a new, integrated form of leadership by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional for this length. Her motivation as an "insurgent grandmother" is established with concrete detail—"quiet, deliberate preservation"—and her internal state is embodied through actions, such as her unconscious telepathic outreach when frustrated. The final choice is a perfect culmination of her established traits, and the quiet smile at the end feels earned, fulfilling her desire to "evolve tradition with intent." The contradiction between her gnarled, earthy physicality and her subtle, powerful mental abilities is compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s interiority is rendered with concrete, embodied specifics, particularly the "map of tension written through somatic markers," which avoids cliché. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively during the panic attack, and her final shift from seeing the photo as a "cruel joke" to "evidence" is an earned, character-particular change, fulfilling her stated motivation to "anchor optimism in realism."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is very strong, with a clear motivation rooted in an embodied internal state. The shift from despair to active creation is earned and credible. A minor deduction is for the final paragraph’s slight over-articulation of her internal change ("She had untangled the threads of despair..."), which verges on summarizing an epiphany that was already powerfully shown through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and potent, driving the narrative with philosophical weight. The transformation of her “serene anger” at the end provides a strong, earned closure. However, the interiority occasionally leans on direct labels, with the central epiphany delivered as a concise, almost academic summary ("The mind, in its desperation for order, simply created more of it...") which slightly undermines the embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's core conflict between duty and curiosity is sharp and compelling, leading to a credible, costly choice. The transformation from "guardian of endings" to initiator is earned. However, a few instances of generic emotional embodiment ("heart...began to hammer") and a slightly too-explicit statement of motive ("Her motivation was not rebellion, but...") slightly flatten the interiority, holding it back from top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, creating a strong central character. Her internal conflict is established effectively through the contrast with her father. The final choice to offer a rose is a perfect expression of her values, earning the story's resolution with a visible, character-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exemplary for this scope. Kaelen’s defining trait, “cool-headed,” is not merely stated but rigorously tested against the garden's psychic pressure. His ability to acknowledge the overwhelming loneliness without succumbing to it is demonstrated through action, culminating in the climax where his focused silence overpowers the goddess’s sorrow—a moment that proves character and earns the resolution with a clearly felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation is exceptionally clear, transitioning logically from preserving a legacy to uncovering its hidden truths. Elara’s internal conflict between her inherited identity and her dawning horror is palpable, culminating in a final choice that feels both shocking and inevitable. The arc from passive observer to active agent is earned through a crucible of discovery, and the cost is felt in the dismantling of her entire worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific, personal guilt that fuels her professional obsession. Her internal conflict is well-established and the final action provides an earned resolution, shifting her from a state of unquiet penance to quiet acceptance. The realization in paragraph five, "The past was haunting the present because she was still living inside it," verges on diagnostic label-speak but is sufficiently grounded by the preceding discovery to avoid feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and embodied, but her character operates more as a flawless archetype—the wise artist who solves the world's emotional conflict—than a complex individual with internal contradictions. The secondary characters are functional but lack depth, serving only as a convenient externalization of the central problem. Her competence is never in doubt, which slightly lowers the sense of personal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and the internal conflict of the “gentle radical” is dramatized effectively, not just stated. The retrocognitive flash provides a powerful, embodied catalyst for her shift in allegiance, making her final defiant action feel earned and inevitable. Her contradictory impulses—duty versus empathy—are held in tension until the climax, where her choice to protect the family pays off the initial premise with a visible, high-stakes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Character motivations are clear, consistent, and poignantly mirrored between Elara and Leo. Elara’s desire "to be perceived" is a powerful engine, and Leo’s grief makes him a perfect witness. Her final change is earned through his climactic act of empathy, providing a costly but fulfilling arc. A slight abstraction in Leo's initial motivation ("lure possibility") is the only minor softness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her defining trait as an “affectionate skeptic” is well-dramatized in her initial dismissal and eventual use of the pill. The internal conflict between her rational mind and a surrender to intuition feels earned. The backstory integration is effective, providing the emotional core for the climax without stalling momentum. The character arc from intellectual struggle to embodied, memory-driven creation is compelling and complete within the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her transformation from cartographer to chronicler provides a solid arc. However, her interiority feels more declared than embodied, particularly at the pivotal moment where her “new resolution crystallized.” The absence of any internal friction or flaw makes her feel slightly more like a thematic vessel than a complex individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is grand and clear, providing a strong narrative engine. However, her characterization lacks internal conflict; she is described as "quietly inspired" and acts with an unwavering "profound sense of purpose." This smoothness flattens her interiority, making her feel more like a function of the story's concept than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and evolves credibly. The shift from a burned spy seeking an abstract "unused courage" to an agent of justice is earned by the discovery of the note. The final internal conflict—instinct screaming to run versus the choice to stand—is dramatized with palpable tension, and her micro-choice to raise her hands is a perfect embodiment of her character. The contradictions are live on the page, and the final change feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elias is a masterfully drawn character for this length; his motivation to "distill complexity into essence" is demonstrated, not just stated, in his interpretation of the river and Linnea's mending. Linnea is slightly less vivid but serves her role effectively, her anxiety providing a necessary contrast to Elias's calm. Their brief relationship is a crucible, forcing the story's central choice with earned credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aris’s characterization is exceptional, particularly the way his “zen mind” is dramatized, not just stated. His response to the temporal fracture—calm observation rather than panic—is crucial and believable, directly enabling the story's unique resolution. The final choice to shape the memory itself, rather than a mere object, represents a perfectly earned change driven by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The contradiction between "wistfully pragmatic" and "protected vulnerability" is not just stated but embodied in her actions—mourning the rose while immediately preparing the pot for something new. Her interiority is concrete and specific, and the final choice to "plant light" is a perfect, earned culmination of her established motivation to "reflect light into dark corners." The character's internal state is rendered with precision and nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lyra's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is established early and provides a strong, clear engine for the narrative. Her internal conflict is palpable as her initial shield of isolation begins to feel like a cage, creating a believable pressure point. The final shift from passive archivist to active navigator is an earned transformation, directly resulting from her persistent engagement with the story's central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation and internal conflict are established with laudable efficiency, moving from a "borrowed room" of emotion to an "architect of connection." The transformation is clear and well-supported by her actions. However, the epiphany that her path forward is an art installation arrives "fully formed," which slightly undermines the sense of struggle and makes the internal journey feel more convenient than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and her interiority is consistent, with her “cautiously hopeful” state providing a clear internal conflict that drives the plot. The transition from that caution to a “steadier, stronger” hope at the end is earned through her decisive action. The characterization is strong, slightly held back by moments where emotional states are labeled rather than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character's motivation is clear and her core internal conflict—prudence versus a deeper drive—is dramatized in the pivotal choice to touch the compass. However, the resolution of her claustrophobia is too abrupt ("Her fear was gone," "a forgotten whisper"). This tidy emotional summary feels unearned, undercutting the initial setup of her greatest fear being a defining trait, which makes the final change feel more like a convenience than a deeply integrated character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her core contradiction—a face-blind artist with preternatural recall—is brilliantly realized. The final emotional shift is earned, paying off the stated goal of awakening empathy with a palpable cost. The only minor weakness is the slightly too-explicit statement of her motive early on, which borders on diagnostic summary rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, and her core internal conflict of being “nervously confident” is well-established. Her actions align perfectly with her goals, creating a believable and driven protagonist. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier because her internal state, while consistently described, doesn't force a truly difficult on-page tradeoff; she proceeds with her plan despite her fear, rather than having to sacrifice something because of it.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and undergoes a compelling shift from documentary truth-seeking to artistic creation. Her interiority as a photographer is specific and embodied ("her mind a constant aperture"). The final motivation, "to sculpt possibility," feels slightly over-articulated, bordering on a thematic label rather than a purely character-driven impulse, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s motivation is clear and his actions are a clever, non-violent reinterpretation of his inherited skills, which is a strong point. The internal conflict between his lineage and his desire for a new path is well-drawn. The final choice is earned, but the characterization is slightly weakened by the overly articulate self-awareness in the concluding paragraphs, which feels more like an authorial summary than a character’s embodied realization in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her shift from passive observer to active agent is well-executed. However, her interiority lacks compelling contradiction; her decision path is rational and linear, missing the embodied emotion and internal conflict of a top-tier piece. The story tells us she feels a burden, but doesn't dramatize the internal struggle between her solitary duty and this new, urgent obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The characterization is strong, with a clear internal conflict between Elara’s guarded pride and her need to atone. Her transformation is earned through a specific, costly choice. The only minor weakness is the final epiphany, which verges on diagnostic self-awareness ("A new understanding blooms within her..."), slightly over-articulating the change rather than leaving it fully embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but its expression as a "compulsion etched into her very being" verges on telling rather than showing. Her actions are purposeful, but the lack of hesitation at the climax—"without hesitation"—misses an opportunity for a final, potent beat of internal conflict. While the internal state of "anxious elation" is named, its embodiment could be sharper; the resolution feels more like a conceptual download than a deeply earned personal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her core trait of “fiercely gentle” is dramatized effectively through her specific actions, not just stated. The choice to offer her memories at the climax is a powerful and earned culmination of her character, transforming her initial failed bargain into a meaningful sacrifice. The internal journey from guilt to redemptive action is concise and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The characterization is strong, with a clear internal conflict between Leo’s insulated present and his vibrant past. His motivation to find purpose is palpable and drives the narrative. The epiphany feels slightly over-articulated in the fifth paragraph, stepping away from embodied emotion toward diagnostic summary, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elian’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and his transformation from haunted ambition to quiet hope is earned through his specific skillset. The internal conflict between his rigid, scientific hubris and his underlying methodical patience is well-dramatized. The final choice is a credible renunciation of his old methods, with the cost of his life’s work making the shift feel significant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The librarian’s internal conflict between order and chaotic, lunar change is superbly dramatized, not just stated. This contradiction acts simultaneously, compelling the central action of the story. The final return to stasis is earned, representing a cycle completed rather than a static state, which fulfills the character's core motivation with a legible, cyclical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silas has a clear initial motivation and a compelling, if rapid, arc. The shift from "calcified soul" to anointing a shared truth is powerful. However, the internal change is articulated as happening "in an instant," which slightly undermines the sense of a difficult, earned struggle, feeling more like a sudden, frictionless epiphany delivered by the plot device rather than a deeply wrestled-with transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, driving her precise, self-destructive, and ultimately redemptive actions. The internal conflict is well-dramatized through her shift from third-person clinical distance to first-person confession. The final choice to play the accordion is an earned and embodied expression of her change, avoiding a purely intellectual epiphany. The characterization is strong, specific, and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    The character’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, but the emotional interiority sometimes relies on declarative summary rather than embodied experience. The climactic emotional shift ("A wave of pure, exuberant joy washed over me, tempered immediately...") is labeled rather than shown through perception or action, which slightly flattens its impact. The final acceptance is earned, but the moment-to-moment internal conflict could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is compellingly established as a conflict between a personal dream and a public good. The internal contradiction is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice that renounces her personal desire for a quiet life. The "mulberry ache" provides a specific, embodied emotional anchor that makes the final note's "antithesis" land with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and compelling, driving every action. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, specific details, such as her heartbeat becoming a "distant rumor." The character's change is subtle but earned: she moves from a watchful professional to a participant who ends "weary and hollowed out," a felt cost that makes her peace at the end resonant and believable.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal conflict between a desire for resolution and the reality of her unease is well-established. Her actions (climbing the tree) are character-particular and drive the plot. The final change is earned, but the articulation of her epiphany feels slightly too self-aware and tidy, abstracting the emotion into a neat insight rather than leaving it fully embodied in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kael's characterization is exceptional, with his internal conflict made manifest through external tells like his "sincerely insincere courtesy" and rigid posture. The story effectively dramatizes his contradictory impulses, and his final change is earned through a specific, psychologically credible trigger. Elara is a well-realized catalyst, though her own interiority remains secondary, which is appropriate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The character arcs are clear and well-motivated, particularly Kael's shift from frustration to awe. However, Elara feels slightly archetypal as the "wise mentor," and the dialogue near the end, where both characters articulate the theme, veers into diagnostic explanation, slightly flattening their voices in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is exceptionally clear and the story delivers a satisfying, earned change that fulfills it. His interiority is consistent with his role, showing his world through specialized perceptions (vibrations, bird patterns). However, the characterization remains somewhat archetypal, serving the concept more than revealing deep, contradictory impulses in-scene. The final sentence, "He was the harmony now," while resonant, slightly abstracts his state rather than grounding it in a final, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elian's motivation is clear, consistent, and effectively drives the entire narrative arc from his initial curiosity to his final, costly decision. The internal conflict between his guild training and his intrinsic values is well-dramatized through his actions. The final crystallization of his identity as a "true mage" feels earned, though the epiphany is articulated with a touch more summary than embodiment in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s core motivation is clear, but his characterization relies more on a lyrical archetype than on specific, contradictory impulses. The revelation that he "hid behind" the truth of being a simple man feels asserted rather than dramatized, as we never see this facade under pressure before it melts away. The transformation is powerful conceptually, but the internal groundwork for it is thin, making the change feel more bestowed than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to "wavelength align with purpose" is clear and tested by the prophecy's induced doubt. The internal conflict is present, and her shift from passive observer to active composer is a strong character turn. The arc is slightly undercut by the speed of her solution; the "sparked an idea" moment feels more like a convenient epiphany than a choice born from the dramatized struggle promised by the "weeping" part of the prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional. Silas’s motivation evolves from a vague “dull, perpetual ache” into a “sharp, specific need,” a progression that is both clear and deeply felt. The transformation is earned through the ritualistic action, culminating in the final, embodied tremor of effort, which convincingly sells his shift from an endpoint to a point of communion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elian’s characterization is exceptional. His core contradiction—being a “lukewarm mage” with “brittle devotion” tasked with an impossible goal—is not just stated but dramatized effectively. The shift from fumbling attempts born of earnest naivety to a state of “determined focus” is earned through his meticulous observation. The final transformation, where naivety is replaced by “quiet, certain knowledge,” provides a resonant internal closure with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional, rooting Elias’s motivation in a specific, compelling purpose: "to spin stories into shared meaning." The internal conflict between his professional duty and the resurfacing personal trauma is dramatized effectively, not just summarized. The shift from a man trying to "expunge" a memory to one who chooses to "bear its weight" is earned through the discovery of the bottle and photos, creating a powerful and credible change with a clear emotional cost. The 9+ test is met, as his contradictory impulses are active on the page, leading to a fully earned final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between logic and sentiment is well-dramatized through her perception of the dew crystal. The "secretly sentimental" trait is shown to have stakes, enabling her breakthrough. The final emotional release is earned, though some initial characterization relies on direct statements ("whose mind was a ledger of formulae") rather than purely showing, which slightly tempers the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively dramatized by her choice to improvise under extreme pressure. The internal conflict between professional duty and rising panic is palpable and well-handled. However, the characterization relies on labeling key traits ("attentively inventive") and motivations ("to preserve trust under pressure") rather than letting them emerge purely from action, which slightly flattens the interiority for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s motivation is sharp and his arc from recoil to acceptance is well-defined. The internal conflict is clear, though the pivotal realization—seeing emptiness and passion as complementary—reads as a sudden intellectual epiphany rather than a fully embodied, contradictory struggle in the moment. Rin is an effective catalyst, though more archetypal than individual. The final change is earned and the cost is felt, marking a very strong but not flawless character execution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, directly driving the plot. However, her characterization lacks significant internal conflict; she is presented as highly competent and her path to the solution feels linear. The story tells us she felt a "thrill" and "rising alarm," but the execution of her plan proceeds with little dramatized struggle or self-doubt, making her feel more like a capable puzzle-solver than a person under immense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained through the central, unconventional action. The internal conflict is perfectly embodied in the phrase “mournfully eager,” a contradiction that plays out in scene rather than being summarized. The final change in his wife is a direct, earned result of his specific, character-driven choice, fulfilling the 9+ test with a visible cost in the “weathered and healing” quality of the new laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clearly established and consistent, but her interiority relies too heavily on diagnostic labels like "dimensionally homesick" and "a quiet, understood thing." The key epiphany—"Her longing was not an illness, but a connection"—is stated directly, functioning more as a thematic summary than an earned, embodied realization emerging from the struggle itself.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation to break her "stifling destiny" is potent and clear. The core trait "stoically sensitive" is masterfully dramatized; her placid acceptance of failure gives way to the immense emotional energy she pours into the final vivification. The change from hopeless stasis to active, brilliant uncertainty is earned through her intellectual and practical struggle, satisfying the 9+ test for causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative toward a satisfying resolution. The internal conflict between her established, complex methods and the emergent, simple solution is well-dramatized. The final renunciation—discarding the star fragment—is a powerful, embodied choice that externalizes her internal shift, earning the final epiphany with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Leo’s motivation is functional but unearned, arriving as a sudden "deep, instinctual pull" rather than emerging from his established traits under pressure. His defining quality, being "resiliently positive," serves as a convenient tool to bypass despair ("refused to see a curse, but rather a puzzle") instead of creating a complex internal conflict with tangible trade-offs. The character acts as a competent vehicle for the plot, but his interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her internal conflict—rationality versus the chaos she curates—is compelling. The shift from a weaver imposing order to a listener accepting reality is an earned, potent arc for this length. The final transformation is slightly undermined by overly diagnostic interiority ("This was not failure. This was data."), which feels a bit too composed mid-cataclysm, but it's a minor slip in an otherwise strong characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The character motivations for both Elias and Lyra are clear and consistent, but they lack dynamic pressure. Lyra’s interiority is conveyed through generalized states like “somber marvel” and “awe,” which are effective but lack the specific, contradictory impulses of a top-tier character study. The story successfully portrays a shift in her understanding, but this is an intellectual reception rather than a choice born from internal conflict or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her trait of “persistent curiosity” is effectively dramatized, leading directly to the story's escalation. However, labeling this trait her "greatest vulnerability" feels unearned, as it functions purely as a strength in this scene without any demonstrated cost or negative consequence to her, slightly flattening the character's internal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly stated but feels somewhat disconnected from her actions during the climax, where survival instinct logically takes precedence. The claustrophobia is effective for atmosphere but doesn't force a consequential mistake or a more complex choice, functioning more as character color than a crucible. The final thought laudably reconnects to her initial purpose, but the internal conflict during the peak crisis feels muted.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    The character's motivation is obsessive, clear, and perfectly scaled for the story's length. The internal conflict between the obsessive need for answers and the agony of revelation is palpable. The final earned stasis, where Elias "stopped counting," is a powerful renunciation earned through the preceding struggle, demonstrating a complete and credible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and her defining traits—discipline and focus—are demonstrated through her precise actions rather than stated. The story’s peak internal conflict, where she must choose to incorporate the diamond’s dissonance rather than purify it, is a powerful, earned character turn. This choice is not just a plot device; it reveals a profound shift in her understanding of preservation, making the final resolution feel inevitable and true.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with compelling specificity, moving from a curdled academic drive to a profound re-evaluation. The internal conflict between bitterness and awe is dramatized effectively, culminating in a choice to surrender that feels earned, not passive. The transformation of her core desire—to expose a cosmic joke—into a realization of its beauty provides a deeply satisfying closure to her arc with a clear, albeit transcendent, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. However, it is stated directly ("Her motivation was a quiet, desperate flame") rather than fully emerging from contradictory impulses in scene. While her actions are purposeful, her interiority lacks the specific, complex texture that would elevate her from a well-executed archetype to a fully realized individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and compellingly dramatized through his high-stakes trade. His defining trait, being "respectfully rebellious," is shown, not just told, in the key beat where he stops the drone. The story avoids cliché by focusing his broad, abstract goal ("where broken promises heal") into a specific, actionable task—finding one lost boy—which grounds the character in tangible action. The internal state feels authentic, particularly the hammering heart upon success.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core trait—interpreting silence as possibility—is satisfyingly tested and transformed. The central internal conflict between her inherent silence and the compulsion to sing is well-dramatized. The shift in motivation from salvaging parts to completing the horse feels slightly abrupt, relying on a magical compulsion ("the urge was undeniable") that could be more deeply rooted in a pre-existing internal need beyond the general trait.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her transformation from curious curator to knowing custodian is earned and compelling. Her interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly the "deeply geometric" jolt that aligns her perception with the story's core concept. The final shift in her understanding of "sanely eccentric" provides a satisfying character-level closure that mirrors the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with poetic precision and remains the story's engine. Her internal state—the "constant, quiet ache"—is effectively embodied and finds a credible resolution not in erasure, but in fulfillment. The final shift in understanding is earned by the preceding frustration and the climactic, instinct-driven action, satisfying the need for a change rooted in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith is a compelling archetype whose motivation is singular and consistent. His actions, particularly "conversing" with the lock, align perfectly with his purpose. However, his interiority remains somewhat thin; he functions more as a mythic force than a person with internal contradictions, which keeps the characterization just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. Her characterization as a “hands-on folklorist” is not just a label but a functional role that justifies her unique method of investigation. However, her interiority is more focused on intellectual problem-solving than on embodied emotional conflict; the struggle is with the puzzle, not with contradictory impulses in the moment. The final emotional shift to peace is earned by the plot, but feels slightly summarized rather than experienced in a raw, unfolding way.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation, “to mentor resilience quietly,” is established and demonstrated with consistency through her “combative tenderness.” Kael’s physicality (walking backwards) is a strong external expression of internal conflict. While Elara's motivation is stated somewhat explicitly, her actions—offering tools, not pity, and her firm guidance—give it sufficient on-page proof. The characterization is sharp and focused, earning its final moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear, consistent, and propels the narrative. The interiority is effective, particularly the struggle before the climax ("despair clawed at her"). The final choice to give rather than take is a powerful, earned moment of characterization that demonstrates her wisdom. The character reads as a cohesive, if archetypal, figure whose actions align perfectly with her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established through her philosophy of providing a "new purpose," a motive that finds its perfect expression in the final action. Her character is revealed entirely through her focused, competent actions, which is highly effective for this story's ritualistic nature. While direct internal conflict is minimal, the struggle is successfully externalized in the pressure of the task and the charged atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative from intellectual curiosity to profound empathy. The final choice to protect the secret is a perfect, earned culmination of her stated goal to "interpret silence with empathy," demonstrating character through a costly action rather than just interiority. While emotionally resonant, some internal states are slightly declared ("Her motivation was not merely academic") rather than purely embodied, a minor point in an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s characterization is strong, successfully balancing professional competence with a specific internal conflict—her “sophisticated melancholy.” Her motivation shifts organically from a professional survey to a metaphysical task, and her core trait of being “quietly analytic” is believably repurposed as the key to the resolution. The internal contradiction between seeing facts and feeling hollow is well-established and paid off by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal state (voiceless) provides a strong parallel to the ghost's, fueling the climax. The change at the end is earned through this thematic kinship. However, the interiority occasionally verges on being too perfectly articulated, as in the realization of mirroring needs, which slightly lessens the feeling of a messy, contradictory internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and demonstrated through a high-stakes choice that aligns perfectly with his established trait of seeking joy beneath anguish. The internal conflict is subtle but present in the shift from professional duty to personal mission. The story narrowly avoids a penalty for the slightly diagnostic framing of his motivation, as it's presented as an innate compulsion rather than an articulated self-analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Aris's motivation—validating her life's work over ensuring her survival—is established with poetic conviction and remains unwavering. The transition from "cold and sharp" panic to focused observation is credible for a trained professional. Her internal conflict is dramatized, not summarized, culminating in an earned state of serene acceptance that feels both profound and character-particular. The choice to release the pang of loss for her crew is a powerful micro-choice that demonstrates her commitment to the new goal.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is both unique and deeply integrated with his core character trait of face blindness, providing a compelling "why" for the story's events. The internal arc is superb; the shift from a goal of permanent capture to an acceptance of transient beauty is earned through the climax. His final, quiet renunciation of the lens and journal feels inevitable and lands with a palpable, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but she lacks dimension. Her "diligently curious" nature functions more as a plot-solving tool than a trait with costs or contradictions. The story misses opportunities for internal conflict; she experiences no doubt, faces no meaningful resistance, and her "sociable isolation" reads as serene competence rather than a trait with friction. Consequently, her final epiphany feels more like a logical next step than an earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and poetically established, driving the narrative effectively. However, her competence is so absolute that there is no moment of genuine struggle or self-doubt. Actions like opening the complex lock are "the work of a moment," which diminishes the sense of earned victory and makes her feel more like a vessel for the concept than a character tested by it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s altruistic motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions from the initial chalk messages to her final sacrifice. Her internal state is effectively conveyed through imagery like "her hope a brambled thing." However, the other on-page character, Kael, is more of a functional plot device than a developed individual, serving primarily to enact the ghost's instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The character's motivation undergoes a powerful and credible shift, from abstract duty to a deeply personal love, which is earned by the introduction of the puppet head. The final choice is a direct consequence of this internal change, and the cost is felt in her exhaustion. Interiority is strong, capturing a unique blend of cosmic weariness and maternal tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and provides the impetus for the plot. Her shift from weary resignation to decisive action is earned by the discovery of the nut. The characterization is strong, showing her competence through the "offhandedly exact practice," but the internal conflict could have been sharpened with more simultaneous, contradictory impulses in the moments leading to her final, risky choice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's interiority is exceptionally well-realized, filtering the abstract concept of grief through the specific, concrete lens of polymer chemistry. This synthesis of profession and emotion creates a highly particular and credible consciousness. However, the final beats of his realization sometimes slip into over-articulated self-awareness, as in "the divergent path of his life became clear," which slightly undermines the otherwise embodied emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives the narrative, but his characterization is nearly indistinguishable from his function and the story's central concept. The visitor is similarly archetypal, defined entirely by her problem. While this suits the fable-like tone, the lack of any embodied contradictory impulse or meaningful flaw—beyond a scholarly obsession—keeps the characterization from achieving the highest tier of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaelen’s motivation to “sandpaper rough memories” is exceptionally clear and dramatized. His interiority is concrete and specific to his unique senses, particularly in tasting remorse. The final cost, a “new stone in his gut,” is embodied and earned, powerfully demonstrating the consequence of his sacrificial professionalism. A slight touch of diagnostic language ("confirmed his diagnosis") is the only minor friction in an otherwise stellar character execution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the entire narrative. Her interiority is concrete, particularly the embodiment of the clock's discord as a "physical ache." However, her competence is so complete that it precludes any meaningful internal conflict or struggle; she identifies the problem and executes the solution without a moment of doubt or a single misstep, which slightly flattens the character arc into a demonstration of skill rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and her transformation is earned through the visceral experience of the memories. Her interiority shows a compelling contradiction between "awe and visceral fear," and her agency is clear when she instinctively modifies the interface. The characterization is strong, only slightly softened by occasional emotional labels where embodied sensation could be even more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her competence drives the plot, but her characterization lacks texture. She operates with perfect foreknowledge and execution, which lessens the sense of genuine struggle; her "prism-mind" is a label for intelligence rather than a demonstrated, contradictory mode of perception. A moment of miscalculation or internal conflict would have elevated her from a capable plot-vehicle to a more compelling individual.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The character's motivation is singular and powerfully established as an "aching need." His interiority is well-rendered, particularly the shift from a technical to an empathetic approach. The final epiphany—"He understood"—is slightly abrupt, lacking the preceding micro-choices to fully earn the transition from failed tool to personal conduit, but the overall character arc is coherent and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional, with her chess background providing a credible and consistent framework for her "thoughtfully precise" actions and perceptions. The motivation "to discover beauty in the difficult" is a strong driver, and the internal arc lands perfectly in the final beat with the re-contextualized worry stone. The only hairline flaw is the direct narration of her motivation, which slightly tells what the rest of the story shows so elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict drives the story's pivotal turn. The shift from a technical to an empathetic approach is well-motivated by her moment of doubt. However, the realization is slightly over-articulated with the diagnostic line, "This shift was her true path to empathy, moving from acquisition to connection," which tells the reader the theme rather than fully embodying it in the character's internal process.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, and her primary flaw—her ambition—is the central engine of the conflict, creating a credible internal struggle. The change she undergoes is earned through the story's events, particularly the shift from frantic effort to mindless doodling. The final choice to embrace the flower's decay is a powerful culmination of her arc, with the cost being the renunciation of her old, control-obsessed self.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation is singular and clear, driving the narrative effectively. The transformation from an inquisitive pilot to a protective guardian is earned and provides a strong closing arc. Her final choice—a renunciation of her initial goal of acquisition—is a powerful moment of character change, demonstrating her values with a tangible cost. Interiority is well-handled but could have shown more contradictory impulses in the moment of discovery to elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The character is a strong, consistent vehicle for the plot, driven by a clearly stated professional motivation. His actions align perfectly with his role as a methodical investigator. However, his interiority lacks contradiction or embodied emotion; he reads as a highly competent problem-solver rather than a person experiencing a crisis, which limits the characterization's depth and keeps it out of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives the plot. However, her interiority during the climax feels summarized rather than embodied; phrases like "She poured her entire being" state her effort but don't convey the visceral struggle or contradictory impulses of a character under immense pressure. She functions more as a perfect vessel for the magic than a complex individual whose flaws complicate the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and directly drives every action on the page. The character is defined by a shift from a traditional role (guardian) to a new one (scholar of failure), and her culminating choice—to seal rather than destroy—perfectly dramatizes this internal evolution. Her interiority is consistent and her actions, particularly the reverence shown to the flute, align perfectly with her motives, earning the final change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aris's motivation is clear and his internal conflict drives the narrative effectively. The final transformation from intellectual observer to authentic feeler is earned by the overwhelming climax. The concept of "borrowing personalities" is well-established and paid off, creating a satisfying arc. The characterization is strong, though some moments of interiority read as slightly too self-aware, particularly the final summary of his old habit as a "defense."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, progressing from a specific, embodied anxiety ("jittery relic courier," "knuckles were white") to a state of earned purpose. Her internal conflict regarding Kaelen’s words is established early and resolved through action, not just reflection. The final shift to "keeper" is a decisive change earned by the preceding events, with the cost being the foreclosure of her old life and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation driving the narrative. Her internal shift from a researcher seeking proof to a mystic in communion is earned and profound, grounded in a specific blind spot about the scale of her own ambition. The final change has a clear, felt cost—her wounded pride—making her arc fully realized and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from weary endurance to insightful sacrifice is complete. However, her interiority relies more on descriptive labels like "wistful" and "profound weariness" than on embodied, contradictory impulses within the scene. The moment of epiphany, while pivotal, feels more like an idea arriving than a choice forged from internal conflict, which slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's characterization is consistent and compelling. Her identity as a "meek blacksmith" is skillfully translated into a quiet, methodical determination that informs her actions, particularly the non-violent, crafted solution at the climax. The motivation is singular and powerful. A minor weakness is the slight tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness, as when her idea crystallizes into the named concept "azure defiance," which feels more like an authorial label than an in-the-moment thought.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is sharp and believably escalates from professional curiosity to a personal quest. Her interiority is well-rendered through embodied sensations, particularly the synesthetic translation of the environment. The change at the end is earned, as she takes on the emotional weight of the discovered truth. The man functions effectively as the catalyst for the final revelation, though he is more of a thematic endpoint than a fully realized character, which is acceptable for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elvan's transformation from a reticent observer to a committed keeper is powerful, but the internal pivot feels slightly abrupt for a man "not given to fancy." The motivation is driven more by the story's thematic needs than by a dramatized internal struggle, making his ultimate choice feel poetically right but psychologically swift. His established trait of being "warmly observant" does the necessary work to make his investigation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas's motivation is clear and his defining internal conflict—the "dread-tinged thrill" of his uncontrollable, prophetic laugh—drives the plot. The final change is earned by the climax. However, the emotional state of "shadowed elation" is labeled more than it is fully embodied in contradictory impulses, and the final epiphany feels slightly too articulated, pulling back from perfect character-particular interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her internal state is well-embodied through the physical sensation of the donor heart. The dye master serves as an effective catalyst, though she functions more as a wisdom archetype than a fully developed character. The final internal shift is earned, but its articulation in the last two paragraphs verges on diagnostic self-awareness, slightly reducing the impact of the preceding embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in the specific, original concept of “quantified sorrow.” The interiority is concrete, but the final epiphany is articulated with a bit too much diagnostic clarity. The line, “The miracle wasn’t in the magic, but in the mundane realization…” reads like a summary of the theme rather than an embodied experience, slightly undermining an otherwise earned character change.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyra’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are a direct, compelling expression of it. The transformation from a “keeper of fragments” to a “weaver of wholes” provides a satisfying and earned arc for this length. The characterization is slightly held back from the highest tier by an interiority that, while clear, relies more on archetypal feeling (“heart a frantic drum,” “profound, quiet joy”) than on specific, contradictory impulses acting in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, rooted in a specific trait (empathy) that directly enables the climax. Her interiority is concrete, particularly in the library where she extends her senses to place and stone. The final change from a recluse seeking shelter to one whose solitude is a new kind of library is earned, but the characterization is slightly softened by descriptive labels like "compassionate recluse" and "keenly empathetic" where showing might have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the story's quiet action. Her interiority is well-rendered, particularly the initial feeling of loss for the bakery. While Anya is less developed, she serves her role effectively, and their partnership feels believable. The characterization is very strong, stopping just shy of exceptional due to a lack of significant internal contradiction in the final decision-making process.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Archivist’s motivation is singular and clear, driving every action. His "gently meticulous" nature is well-demonstrated through his careful handling of the slides and apparatus. The final shift from a preserver of decay to a curator of eternal truths is a profound change, earned by the story's central discovery. The character is slightly archetypal, lacking a deep internal contradiction beyond his initial flawed premise, but his focused transformation is executed flawlessly within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and unwavering, driving every choice. Her competence is balanced with a believable struggle, shown through her initial failed attempt which then informs her successful one. The characterization of Silas is masterful in its economy; his “profound, weary shame” is conveyed without a single word, making the betrayal feel tragic rather than purely villainous and deepening the story's emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear initially, but her pivotal shift from "luminous skeptic" to participant feels slightly rushed. The story states her awe and understanding ("Her skeptic’s mind, for the first time, had no rebuttal, only awe") rather than fully dramatizing the internal process of such a profound worldview collapse, making her final choice feel more reactive than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from a reaction to humiliation into a proactive choice. Her central internal conflict—the mnemonic gift as both curse and conduit—is well-realized and drives the narrative. However, the final epiphany feels slightly too intellectual and swift; "The truth crashed upon her" and her subsequent realization could have been more embodied, showing more of the struggle and contradiction in the moment of choice rather than a clean, declarative insight.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation is sharp and directly tied to her unique, embodied conflict—the physical revulsion to dishonesty versus her professional obligation. Her interiority is concrete, especially the "sickening wilt" in her fingertips. The final choice, a confession of fear, is a believable culmination of her desperation, making the change she undergoes feel earned. A slight deduction is for the direct articulation of her motivation, which verges on summary, but her subsequent actions successfully dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and powerfully simple, driving her actions with credible endurance. Her interiority is palpable, particularly the "muted vigor" that defines her resolve. The characterization is strong and consistent, but it lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulse; her path is one of pure, unwavering competence, which slightly flattens her arc for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The android’s character arc from caretaker to pilot is compelling and earned through a credible internal struggle. The motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure. The change is crystallized in the climax, though the final description of its state ("fragmented wholeness") verges on diagnostic summary, a minor slip in an otherwise strong portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The curator’s motivation is overly explicit and serves the theme more than a believable internal state; "to prove that listening heals" reads like an authorial thesis statement. While her actions (waiting, listening) are consistent, her interiority lacks the specific, contradictory impulses of a top-tier character. She functions more as a perfectly calibrated instrument for the plot's thematic purpose than a complex individual.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her core competency is demonstrated through a unique, decisive action. The final choice effectively tests her character. However, her defining trait as a "lyrical code breaker" sometimes feels more asserted by the narration than fully embodied in the moment-to-moment interiority, which leans on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silas's motivation is established clearly and his actions are consistent. The transformation from a simple keeper of light to a knowing "keeper of the darkness" is earned and impactful. The characterization is strong, though his interiority sometimes relies on direct summary ("He understood then...") rather than fully embodied realization in the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The summoner’s motivation is singular and powerfully established, driving every action with clarity. His interiority is evocative, though it serves the story's concept more than it reveals deep, contradictory impulses; when the prophecy attacks, his wavering is brief and his return to a centered state is swift. While this demonstrates immense discipline, a more sustained struggle between contradictory internal states in that key moment could have elevated the characterization from archetypal to uniquely individual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Character motivations are clear and the central relationship, built on "agreed upon lies," is a fantastic crucible for the story. The climax is slightly weakened by Mrs. Gable's dialogue explicitly diagnosing Elara's motivation ("You came to remember something you think your blood still knows"), which feels more like an external summary than an earned, internal realization in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, but her transformation from skeptic to believer is too rapid and frictionless. The interiority becomes overly diagnostic, relying on abstract labels like "translate this isolation into independence" rather than embodied emotion, which makes her pivotal choice feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her competence is well-established through her perceptions as a forger. The internal conflict between duty and the need for understanding drives the narrative effectively. The final shift in motivation is powerful, though the line "to forgive the unfinished nature of his story, and of all stories" borders on diagnostic summary rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear, consistent, and drives the plot. Her defining trait of being "richly perceptive" is well-demonstrated through action. The antagonist’s motivation is functional for this length but slightly thin, rooted in a simple "bitter greed." The protagonist's arc from seeking knowledge to taking decisive action is earned and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is established clearly and drives her actions consistently. However, her interiority reads as more of a skilled professional's process than a deeply felt internal struggle. Emotions are often labeled ("she felt his terror, his regret") rather than fully embodied, and she faces no significant internal conflict or contradiction in her methods, which limits character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Hideo's motivation is established with philosophical depth and enacted through specific, quiet actions. The concept of "demure audacity" is perfectly embodied in his silent confrontation with the headman, where his choice to demonstrate his worldview rather than argue reveals a profound internal consistency. The headman serves as an effective, pragmatic foil, making Hideo's unique perspective shine.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action from the inciting incident to the final, costly choice. His trade as a "conspiracy debunker" is not just a label but is dramatized through his methodical skepticism and meticulous work. The final choice to destroy the illusion is a perfect, earned culmination of his stated desire to "excavate truth from comfortable lies," landing with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established and sustained, driving every beat from her initial listening to her final, difficult choice. The internal conflict between her "gritty determination" and "whimsical hope" feels authentic, and her final act is an earned renunciation of her initial method, not her core belief. The characterization is superb for this length, demonstrating a clear hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s motivation is established with poetic precision and directly fuels every action. His interiority is concrete, particularly the embodiment of the “positively wistful feeling” which reads as a specific, character-particular sorrow rather than a stock emotion. The final earned stasis feels inevitable, a direct result of his focused, almost ritualistic, process. The character is a perfectly rendered archetype for a fable of this nature.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her actions are consistent and compelling. However, her core trait of being "logically emotional" is stated rather than dramatized as an internal conflict; her logic and emotion work in concert, not in tension, which flattens the interiority. The final transformation into being "part of the song" lacks a visible cost, reading more as a triumphant power-up than an earned, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    Kaelen’s characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between his "searing impatience" and the profound patience his work demands. This contradiction is not merely stated but dramatized in his craving for a "crack in thesky" versus the methodical work he performs. The final, decisive action is a masterful resolution, showing his internal change—sculpting his impatience into a legacy—is earned and embodied, culminating in the perfect final line about his restrained wildness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear, and her internal conflict between professional detachment and human empathy is dramatized effectively. The final transformation of her motivation feels earned, moving from a personal goal (escape the Department) to a selfless one (bear witness for the forgotten), a change that carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eli's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a specific, human-scale failure that convincingly represents a larger spiritual crisis. The internal conflict between guilt and doubt is shown, not just told, culminating in a final change of purpose that is earned by the story's central symbolic event. Anya serves as an effective catalyst, her archetypal wisdom sharpened by concise, targeted dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kiv’s motivation is exceptionally clear and well-embodied. The internal conflict—"a chuckle at his own grand folly warring with a bone-deep belief"—is demonstrated rather than stated, culminating in a choice born of "desperation and inspiration." The final shift from frustration to "irreverent awe" feels earned and satisfying, marking a coherent and compelling character arc within the tight word count.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative from a quiet obsession to a high-stakes moral decision. Her final choice is earned by her established character. However, the internal conflict leading to this choice is more summarized ("She had to make a choice") than dramatized, slightly flattening the emotional climax of her journey from passive keeper to active agent.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kaelen’s motivation is explicit and drives the central choice to defy orders. However, the interiority is more declarative than embodied, with key traits and motives stated directly ("her mind a still pool," "a deep-seated need to map empathy onto action") rather than emerging purely from action and perception under pressure. The character's actions are consistent, but the execution leans on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    The character's motivation is both peculiar and compelling, established immediately and driving every subsequent action and observation. Elara's internal change from a "tourist" seeking an external sound to a participant in a universal silence is earned and deeply resonant. The final renunciation of her quest is a powerful, character-defining act with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear but veers into abstraction with the phrase "a deep, aching need to nurture intersubjective understanding." This diagnostic language feels imposed rather than embodied, slightly weakening an otherwise sensitive portrayal. Leo's characterization is functional but lacks the same interior depth, serving primarily as a catalyst for Elara’s thematic resolution. The strength lies in Elara's quiet, contradictory impulses: the sentinel's solitude versus her aching need for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent, creating a strong central pillar for the narrative. Her interiority is conveyed effectively through her unique perceptual abilities rather than direct emotional summary. The scout's characterization is sparse but serves its function perfectly as an unexpected "tool," a choice that reveals Elara's focused pragmatism. The characterization lacks a significant internal conflict or flaw that complicates her choices, which keeps it from the highest tier, but she reads as a coherent and compelling individual for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her defining traits ("perceptively calm focus") are demonstrated through action. The internal change she undergoes is earned by the story's central discovery. However, her interiority occasionally lapses into summary, particularly in the final act with phrases like "a warm, earnest whimsy filling her chest," which labels the feeling rather than embodying it through a more specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her transformation from a “reticent scholar” to a public testifier is the story’s powerful core. The interiority is well-drawn, particularly the moment of discovery where her “heart hammered against her ribs.” The final choice feels earned by her obsession and the cost—the loss of her quiet, solitary life for a new "profound duty"—is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas's motivation is exceptionally clear, and his internal conflict between knowing and forgetting is dramatized through specific, consistent actions. The character is built on a compelling contradiction that feels both mythic and psychologically grounded. The final act of endurance—resuming his method—is a perfectly earned expression of his established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s characterization is strong and consistent. Her motivation to “harness the ephemeral” is established early and paid off with a meaningful shift in understanding at the conclusion. The internal state, particularly the "luminous ache," effectively tracks her emotional arc from a beautiful pain of preservation to a comforting source of strength. The execution is very strong, with her change feeling earned by the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving the story’s single, focused action. The characterization is strong, showing her professional serenity and empathy through her choices, particularly the micro-choice of how to deliver the bad news with kindness and dignity. Arthur is rendered effectively with minimal lines, his love and longing made palpable through the offered record shard. The story passes the 9+ quick test as Elara's choice is earned with the visible cost of Arthur's life, framed as a gift of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation is compelling and her tactics evolve directly from her character—the scholar’s initial reliance on data gives way to a more personal, intuitive approach. This change is earned by the initial failure, creating a small but satisfying arc. The shift is slightly articulated rather than fully embodied in one moment ("Perhaps the answer wasn't in cold data..."), but her subsequent actions are a powerful demonstration of this new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's characterization is strong, with a clear motivation that drives the plot. The transformation from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who embraces the impossible is earned through her actions. However, the explicit statement of her motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" feels slightly too articulated, like an authorial thesis statement rather than a purely organic character trait, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, and her final choice is a believable evolution of her initial goal. The grandmother memory provides an effective anchor. However, the core internal conflict—weighing solitude against sharing—is explicitly stated rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in the scene, which slightly softens the cost of her final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her central action—offering the moss—is a perfect expression of her “quietly proactive” nature. The internal conflict between her need for refuge and her impulse to connect is well-dramatized by Leo's arrival. The characterization is strong, though a few phrases like "protected vulnerability" and "graft new meaning" read slightly too much like diagnostic labels rather than embodied feeling, holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. The novelist's central conflict—a purveyor of comforting lies unable to create one for himself—is established with immediate, potent irony. His internal state is rendered through embodied details like the "cold stone" of shame, not just labels. The final shift from cynicism to fragile hope is earned through the crucible of memory, making the change credible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks complexity. She exhibits competence and determination without any significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in the scene. The final emotional release is earned, but the character arc is flat, reading more as a successful execution of a plan than a journey that tests or changes her in a deep way.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation for preservation is established as a compelling contradiction to her craft, and her actions are seamlessly aligned with this purpose. Her interiority is conveyed through intense focus rather than conflict; she is a vessel for the ritual. While the execution is flawless, the lack of an in-scene contradictory impulse or visible struggle against a flaw keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, and her specific "peripherally focused" nature is demonstrated through action, not just stated. The characterization is strong and specific. However, it lacks a significant internal conflict or a moment where contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier of complexity for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    The protagonist’s motivation is singular and potent, and her internal state is rendered with exceptional, non-generic texture (e.g., "whalebone reverie"). The transformation from being "boundary-lessly trapped" to "oriented" is earned through a specific, action-based epiphany. The internal conflict is masterfully externalized in the physical act of weaving, making the character’s struggle tangible and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear and sustained, with her interiority rendered in concrete, specific terms like learning to breathe around his absence "like air thin at a high altitude." The character's earned change is legible and powerful. The score is capped below 9.0 because a few key realizations, like "love does not vanish; it transmutes," verge on being over-articulated, slightly flattening the complexity of her internal state with diagnostic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with specificity, particularly the "chronologically confused mind" and the embodied sense of her ambition being "worn down." The internal conflict between wanting release and her resolute nature feels authentic. The final change is earned through the confrontation, showing a credible progression from seeking severance to accepting partnership, with the cost of that choice made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks depth due to an absence of internal conflict or struggle. The story presents her as perfectly competent; her audacious idea arrives "complete" and is executed without a single misstep or moment of doubt. This frictionless success makes her feel more like a vehicle for the concept than a person grappling with a monumental task, flattening the emotional arc of her quiet victory.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her arc from passive scribe to active creator is earned. The internal conflict is well-established, with her "tender spirit" providing a credible reason for her retreat. The interiority is strong, though a few phrases like "a frozen mechanism in her soul" verge on being slightly too diagnostic, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is specific and drives the narrative effectively. Her interiority is well-drawn, and the final change—the "serene upheaval"—is earned by the on-page discovery, representing a credible shift in understanding. The character’s methodology ("training instincts") provides a unique lens that feels consistent from setup to payoff. Her actions are aligned with her contemplative nature, making for a cohesive and believable portrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her defining trait of patience is well-dramatized through her actions, particularly the gentle "coaxing" of the knot. The transformation from collector to initiate is earned. However, the interiority occasionally lapses into summary ("Her work was one of infinitely patient observation") and the final epiphany feels slightly over-articulated ("They didn't weave fate; they wove potential..."), bordering on a diagnostic label rather than a purely embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.5)
    Characterization is exceptional, particularly for this length. Elara's motivation is established with poetic precision and her internal shift is earned through a concrete, sensory experience, not a declarative epiphany. Isolde, though secondary, is rendered with immense dignity; her grief as a "presence" is a powerful and specific choice. The change in Elara's understanding of her own purpose is profound and feels inevitable by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prince's motivation is exceptionally clear and drives every action. His interiority is well-rendered, particularly the embodied emotions like his trembling hands and the tears on his grimy cheeks, which ground his high-minded quest in physical reality. The final shift from desperate hope to a complex acceptance is earned through the events on the page, representing a credible change. A minor weakness is the slight tendency toward declarative interiority, such as stating his method was "hypothesizing about everything," which is less potent than showing it in action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara's core contradiction as the "arsonist's daughter" turned firefighter provides a powerful, consistent motivation. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her connection to the landscape and her actions. The final emotional shift to "kelp-drift peace" is earned through the preceding ritual, representing a credible change with a deeply felt, though internal, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her final transformation is earned. The central internal conflict of "skepticism warred with her hope" is slightly more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the lead-up to the climax, which keeps this from the highest tier. However, her actions are consistent, and her interiority is specific enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a passive archivist to an active problem-solver. The change is earned through the story's central discovery, and the cost—exchanging a melancholy peace for an infinite, difficult purpose—is palpable. Her interiority is specific and consistent with her otherworldly nature, effectively tracking the story's emotional and philosophical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but the inciting driver feels somewhat imposed rather than arising from a deeper, pre-existing internal conflict. The line "Her motivation, long dormant, ignited" functions as a convenient switch. While her thoughtful nature is well-established through her craft, she reads more as a sensitive vessel for the story's theme than a character with sharp, contradictory impulses tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's motivation is exceptionally clear, rooted in a powerful, embodied sense of duty. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively when the pendulum bob's appearance shatters her coping mechanism, forcing a confrontation between her contradictory impulses—to repair or to renounce. The final choice to still the clock is a significant but earned character change, directly resulting from the "searing reverie" that re-frames her lifelong diligence as a cage. This shift from meticulous reparation to radical renunciation is a compelling and complete arc for this story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal shift from "blithe gardener" to world-resurrector feels more like an accepted download of information than an earned, contradictory struggle. The 'before' state is well-established, but the 'after' arrives as a sudden, frictionless epiphany rather than a choice forged under pressure with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation is sharp and consistent, and the internal conflict between doubt ("This was heresy") and duty is dramatized with precision. The use of the kingfisher feather to embody her resolve and the stakes is a masterful touch, linking her internal state to a tangible object with history. The final choice to write is earned and feels inevitable due to this strong internal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is both clear and compellingly strange, driving the narrative with quiet intensity. The shift from aspiring "teacher" to humble "translator" is an earned and resonant character change, directly resulting from the story's central turn. Her interiority is revealed through precise actions—cloaking the window, tuning the radio—rather than overt summary, and the final scene lands as a credible crystallization of her purpose, with the cost of her secrecy and isolation felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's motivation is established with poetic precision and her internal state is beautifully embodied through her ritualistic actions. The story masterfully executes her final shift from an artist of preservation to one of witnessing. This renunciation is earned and carries a visible cost, fulfilling the highest demands of character arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. Silas's motivation is clear, and his internal conflict between obsessive preservation and pragmatic application is dramatized effectively, culminating in an earned character change. The line "sandpaper serenity worn smooth by isolation" perfectly captures his essence. His final choice is a direct result of his contradictory impulses acting in-scene, fulfilling the 9+ test with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    Characterization is exceptional. Anya's "expectantly resigned" state is a beautifully rendered internal contradiction that drives the scene. Leo's transformation from defensive anger to a whispered "How?" is earned and credible, avoiding a sudden, unconvincing epiphany. The change is catalyzed by a powerful idea, not a lecture, which makes his shift feel internally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the central action. The choice to prune the plant creates a strong moment of internal conflict, pitting her nurturing instinct against a necessary, painful wisdom. However, the characterization is slightly weakened by moments of diagnostic interiority, such as "her informal wisdom telling her that true growth often required painful choices," which labels the insight rather than purely embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation to "preserve wonder" is clear and consistent, directly fueling the choice to keep the box that saves the city. The internal conflict between her prescribed duty and her "involuntarily truthful voice" is dramatized effectively, compelling the plot's central reveal. The final line about her words being "simply the truth" provides a satisfying, if slightly too neat, closure to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is clear, specific, and evolves believably from intellectual curiosity to active participation. The arc is earned through her interactions with the objects, culminating in a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable. Her interiority is rendered with concrete, character-particular language like "inadvertent archaeologist of atmosphere," which avoids stock phrasing and anchors her unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Statue’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear and earned arc from a passive, imprisoned observer to an active, purposeful guardian. The transformation is driven by a compelling internal motivation to resolve the fissure in its foundational certainty. While the historian is slightly more of a catalyst than a fully-developed character, her motivation is perfectly calibrated to the story’s needs, acting as the key to the Statue’s prison.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with a clear motivation and a compelling internal contradiction between control (math) and chaos (dice). Her defining trait of being a "grim optimist" is demonstrated, not just stated, and her final shift to a state that is "raw and bright" feels earned by the story’s climax. The final choice is a direct consequence of her established nature as "balancedly daring," making the resolution feel inevitable and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, particularly her "methodically hopeful" nature which is demonstrated rather than just stated. The characterization is strong, though her internal conflict feels more like a steady state of hope-against-despair than a dynamic, contradictory struggle in a peak moment. Her final realization is earned, providing a satisfying closure to her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Characterization is effective for the story's length, with Elara's motivation being clear and driving the plot. Her trembling hands provide a moment of concrete embodiment. The narrator's interiority is established, particularly through the "rosewater dread," but their voice lacks a truly distinct signature, occasionally feeling more like a vehicle for the story's poetic prose than a specific individual. The change at the end is earned, but the characters function more as well-executed archetypes than deeply complex figures.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elias’s motivation to transcend fate is established with conviction and depth, avoiding cliché. His interiority is rendered with exceptional precision through phrases like "bleak exhilaration" and "a joy that was sharp and lonely as a shard of glass," which embody his contradictory state. The character's defining trait—perceiving solutions in reverse—is not merely stated but demonstrated through his entire project, making his final triumph feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motivation crystallizes with impressive speed and clarity, shifting from victim to strategist. Her internal state, particularly the performance of panic while feeling none, demonstrates strong character work. The rapid pivot from post-resuscitation confusion to a complex intellectual gambit feels slightly compressed for this length, but her actions remain consistent with the established motive.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, driving every action. His interiority is established ("restless") but lacks significant contradiction or internal conflict during the climax, where his competence is absolute. The primary weakness is that his struggle feels more like a masterful performance than a desperate fight, which slightly mutes the emotional stakes despite the physical cost of "spent energy."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, effectively driving the plot. His interiority, however, is more intellectual than embodied; the "sunwashed dread" is atmospheric but his personal emotional journey feels somewhat summarized. The final transformation into a "cartographer of the possible" is stated more than earned through a visible internal struggle, making the change feel slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aris's motivation and defining trait ("emotionally rational") are clear and demonstrated effectively in the climax. However, the characters feel slightly more like well-articulated philosophical positions than fully embodied individuals. Elara’s rapid capitulation, while logically prompted by Aris's argument, feels emotionally abrupt and lessens the sense of a genuine struggle between two deeply held convictions.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is exceptional. Elias’s motivation is both specific and deeply felt, and his defining trait of “stoically sensitive” is masterfully dramatized—first established in his controlled movements and then shattered by the locket's discovery. The shift from writing a general memory (‘the orchestra’) to a deeply personal one (‘She hummed when she painted…’) is a powerful, earned micro-choice that perfectly executes his internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Elara's characterization is exceptional. Her core motivation ("to trace honest origins") directly drives the plot, and her defining trait ("tranquilly perceptive") is dramatized through her calm, focused actions during the blackout, not just stated. The final choice to hide the truth rather than reveal it demonstrates a complex, earned shift in her understanding of her duty, resolving the internal conflict with a poignant and credible trade-off. Her interiority is precise and consistent with her role as a Logical Page Indexer.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is rooted in a clear, profound grief that is embodied rather than stated, shown through her clumsy attempts at origami versus her mastery of glass. The internal conflict between hope and despair is externalized brilliantly in the island’s physics, and her final choice to release the memory is a perfectly earned renunciation with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)
    Characterization is exceptional. Elara’s motivation is deeply rooted in her specific trauma, and her interiority is rendered with precise, powerful language ("an error in the perturbation theory of death"). The shift from cold grief to "bleak exhilaration" is a masterfully earned emotional resolution, avoiding all cliché and embodying the story's core thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The motivation to find belonging is clear and effectively drives the plot to a satisfying character change. The payoff for the "perpetually surprised" ocular implants is excellent, turning a physical detail into a thematic anchor. However, the interiority during the climax becomes slightly too explanatory, summarizing the epiphany rather than fully embodying the overwhelming sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s characterization is exceptional. Her motivation, rooted in a specific past guilt, is the "loom upon which she built these beautiful lies," providing a powerful and consistent engine for the narrative. The internal conflict between her desire to offer solace and her compounding guilt is dramatized effectively, culminating in a final, earned realization that doesn't feel like a tidy epiphany but a heavy, reorienting truth. The choice to proceed with the lie while understanding its hollowness is a potent micro-choice revealing her deeply flawed but coherent hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's character is exceptionally well-realized through her actions and consistent interiority, grounded by the totem object. The commander’s shift from reflexive violence to hesitation is earned and made concrete by the unexpected weight of a domestic object. His choice demonstrates a complex internal conflict resolved under pressure, fulfilling the highest standard for characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    The characterization is superb, with Elias’s internal conflict embodied through his relationship with his tools and environment. His motivation is clear and his emotional progression from "merrily melancholic" to overwhelmed by regret is entirely credible. The final change is earned through his endurance, and the cost of abandoning his old self is felt in the laugh of "both joy and grief."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation is clear and her internal journey from erasure to agency is compelling. The character is specific, with her forger's past informing her present methods. However, the epiphany where she understands her life as a series of reactions is slightly too self-aware and articulated, reading less like an organic realization and more like a diagnostic summary of the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation is absolute and drives the narrative effectively. The internal conflict between her desire for the past and her eventual acceptance of transformation is the story's core strength. The final choice to step into Fenrir's form is a powerful, earned action. A minor deduction is for moments where emotion is slightly declared ("her heart a hollow echo," "Despair threatened to consume her") rather than fully embodied in her perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's motivation is potent and clear, rooted in the visceral experience of new fatherhood. His interiority is well-drawn, particularly the shift from desperate seeking to aching acceptance. The final change is earned, but the concluding paragraph slightly undermines the character work by moving into a more abstract summary of his realization, rather than keeping it fully embodied in his final actions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation as a "mender" is clear and consistently drives her actions, particularly the pivotal choice to stitch the photograph. The embodiment of collective grief is strong, but characterization is slightly weakened by a moment of overly diagnostic interiority ("This was her shadow work"), which reads more like an authorial label than an organic thought in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear but abstract, and her primary action of opening the jar feels more determined by the atmosphere than by a complex internal choice. The final epiphany is articulated with a clarity that borders on diagnostic, summarizing her change rather than fully embodying it. While her internal state is consistent, she reads as more of a vessel for the story's theme than a character with contradictory impulses navigating a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kael’s motivation is clear and his actions are a direct, compelling extension of his core trait as “calmly inventive.” His competence is demonstrated through action rather than assertion, lending him credibility. The characterization is slightly limited by a lack of internal friction; his path from problem to solution is executed with such high proficiency that it borders on frictionless, missing an opportunity for a moment of doubt or a costly mistake to deepen the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Kaelen’s motivation is singular, clear, and deeply integrated with his internal conflict—the precognitive curse and the forgotten promise. The story masterfully earns his final shift from "cursed" to "resolved," grounding the change in the climactic epiphany. The line "The promise was not something made to him, but by him" is a perfect, character-particular turn that is earned by the preceding struggle, fulfilling the 9+ test with a visible cost of forsaking control for alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Elara’s motivation is crystalline and compelling, evolving credibly from private preservation to public action. The internal conflict between the compliant ‘Archivist’ and the defiant ‘Poet’ is dramatized through her micro-choices, culminating in an earned transformation. The line "to understand the cartography of scars" provides a powerful, particular anchor for her interiority, which feels specific and un-clichéd throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Characterization is strong and purposeful, with motivation clearly stated and action aligned to it. Elara's shift from duelist to collaborator is earned through the story's central revelation. While the characters serve a conceptual plot, the moment Kaelen's "diplomatically fierce demeanor" breaks into a smile provides a satisfying, humanizing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Excellent. Ezra's central motivation ("to forge beauty from anarchy") is tested and deepened by the plot. The "molting personalities" concept is masterfully paid off and resolved in the climax, where he finds a core self, rather than another skin. The friendship with Silas is the crucible that forces this change, moving believably from shared silence to a dangerous pact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is powerfully established as a "steely longing," and her actions consistently serve this singular goal. Her interiority is concrete, avoiding cliché. The characterization is very strong, though her flawless execution of a complex plan slightly mutes any sense of internal contradiction or struggle during the core sequence; her competence feels absolute rather than hard-won in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motivation is singular and clear, driving the plot effectively. Her interiority is tangible, particularly in the moment of "luminous doubt," which provides a necessary beat of internal conflict before the climax. However, the trait "empirically whimsical" is more asserted than dramatized; her actions read as desperate and intuitive rather than uniquely whimsical under pressure, slightly flattening the character concept's execution.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s motivation is specific, poetic, and sustained, compelling her through the scene. Her interiority is well-embodied, particularly the feeling of regret as a "solid, aching mass." Kaito functions effectively as a catalyst, though his dialogue verges on archetypal wisdom ("The tree does not hurry"). The final emotional shift is earned through the tactile discovery of the lace, fulfilling the 9+ quick test of an earned change with visible cost (accepting the finality of the separation).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation shifts credibly from grief to adaptive investigation, rooted in her artist's eye and embodied ache from the fire, culminating in an earned renunciation of her old life with the visible cost of abandoning glass constellations for lenses.

The resolution's endurance forecloses her prior quest path with the felt cost of the dimmed fragment, earning a meaningful reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in her grandfather's betrayal, intensifying through embodied synesthetic perceptions that compel her quest; interiority is concrete, with contradictory emotions like grief and hope layering realistically. The final renunciation of "fixing" everything earns stasis with felt cost in her tears and acceptance. No second character on-page, so relationship bullets ignored; synesthesia as a flaw complicates her hearing, driving micro-choices like pushing deeper despite pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's motivation to steal moments is clear and intensifies compellingly toward her climactic renunciation, rooted in her savvy grace and interior conflict; her final choice to reinterpret the assignment reveals a hierarchy of values with felt cost, as she foregoes the commission for a "truer art." Interiority is concrete and embodied, showing contradictory impulses in her hesitation over the shutter. The single-POV focus excels without needing secondary characters for pressure, though the violinist and woman feel slightly archetypal in their reunion.

    Elara's contemplative nature and grief-driven motivation are concretely embodied through her glassblowing actions and internal contradictions, culminating in an earned renunciation of her icy anger with visible emotional cost.

    Leo's motivation to prove vulnerability as power is clear and intensifies through embodied fear and micro-choices, like pushing down panic to decrypt the cast; interiority is concrete with contradictory impulses, such as trembling hands versus steady voice at closure. Strengths include flawed traits driving mistakes, like past reliance on Marcus, and emotional progression via self-deception rooted in erased identity. Minor slip in stock phobia labels without deeper embodiment in peak decryption beat slightly limits nuance.

The resolution earns her weary smile and sleep, foreclosing the night's endlessness with a felt physical and temporal cost. This creates a crucible of solitary pressure, revealing her values through persistent, flawed endurance without stereotypes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The robot's motivation is clear and intensifies through the directive to find thoughts' origin, compelling the violin interaction as a higher-stakes choice; interiority is concrete, with embodied composure enabling observation amid chaos without stock phrasing.

    Motivations are clear and rooted in traits, with Elara's desire to transform questions into destinations compelling her choices, though interiority relies on poetic tells rather than deeply embodied contradictions; the mechanical arm effectively reveals character under pressure, as in its whirring during calculation, but emotional progression lacks raw irrationality in peak moments.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, intensifying through her actions like prying the key and repurposing the clock, with embodied longing shown in her steely resolve; however, internal conflict lacks strong contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, trending toward summary rather than scene-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s interior contradiction—data-driven detachment vs. visceral tenderness—is embodied in the micro-choice of lifting the wing. The shift from sterile quantifier to participant in the “experiment” is earned and carries felt cost in her renunciation of emotional distance. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s interior conflict (luminous vs incinerated identity) is embodied and specific; choices reveal shifting values under pressure and culminate in an earned renunciation that forecloses rebuilding the studio.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear, embodied stakes; the inner-ear tilt and absolute silence create a visceral, character-specific lens. The contradiction between hearing nothing and believing in a “song” is active through every page choice, not summarized. A meaningful renunciation/renaming of silence happens under pressure. Motivation never wavers, only intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s exhaustion and craving for stillness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (bone-handled opener, funereal reverence). The contradiction between resisting chaos and answering the lens is dramatized in the moment the light fractures across his parlour walls, not merely summarized. The final renunciation—accepting the grandfather’s stillness as his own—carries visible cost in the gentle hand on the preserved corpse, earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her “quiet, unyielding necessity” drives every beat. The final declaration is earned by prior midnight runs and the bell’s arrival. Cost is visible in her mud-caked exhaustion and the communal silence that follows the bell’s ring. Minor slip: “singular motivation” is stated rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the silver-stained hands, slowed breath, and tear-warm palm all ground her spiritual curiosity in sensory fact. The past-life memory is not merely recalled but metabolized into present choice, turning ancient guilt into active compassion. The final renunciation—she becomes the vessel, not the seeker—earns its cost through the vanished pearl and the lingering warmth. Only a slight over-articulation of “pilgrim of sparks” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her cartographer mind maps the temporal fold—but her contradictory impulses (quest vs. survival) surface only in summary, not simultaneous scene tension. The final renunciation (diminished fragment) is earned yet stated more than embodied. No second character on page, so status crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—raw wrists, silent sorting of keys—yet the “staggering grace” refrain edges toward label-speak. Her contradictory impulses (urgency vs. deliberate calm) are dramatized in the piano-bench beat, and the final renunciation—locking herself in—carries visible cost. The flaw of over-control is credible and compounds the outcome. Minor voice convergence under stress keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority sharp—synesthetic hearing and obsessed drive are credible. Grandfather’s betrayal acts as crucible, but his passivity and off-page status limit relational dynamics. Final embrace of non-repair earns renunciation cost yet strains plausibility of decades-long fixation collapsing into witnessing acceptance in a single ascent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s conflicted interiority propels every beat: the lavender cue triggers a crisis, the moon-beam jar reframes her goal, and her camera’s withheld click is a credible renunciation that costs her patron—and herself—visibility feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her meticulous craft and the “violent, cracking, painful thawing heart” is dramatized in real time. The micro-choice to stop at one orb and place the bookmark on the console crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Minor over-articulation of grief (“fresh puncture wound”) keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo’s internal arc is vivid—shaking hands against steady voice charts embodied terror and new resolve. Micro-choices (kneeling amid claustrophobia, lifting shell to ear, standing to meet Marcus) all derive from prior causation and foreclose retreat. Real birthday cipher and mother’s encoded love crystallize identity change with visible cost in every tremor. Only small dip: near-diagnostic “phobia-ridden” label twice when sensation already dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Oracle’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing pages, hovering brush, final clutch—yet interior contradiction is muted; no competing impulse tests her resolve, so renunciation feels inevitable rather than wrested. Motivation is clear and consistent, but the absence of a genuine internal struggle caps the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    The interiority of Unit 734 is specific, consistent, and mechanically voiced through embodied sensory data rather than psychological shorthand. The choice to raise the bow is causally tied to prior perception loops and costs the unit its status as mere observer, a renunciation rendered with visible price. Only minor slippage into therapeutic labels—“wonder was the anomaly that had gotten it scrapped”—keeps this from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradiction—silent guilt vs. active redress—plays in scene: pocketing the lens, tracing the concert ticket. Her interior oscillation and the decisive final gesture of placing-lens-over-doodle crystallize character change with felt relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet endurance and tactile ritual are vividly embodied; the contradiction between her “wisely pragmatic” label and her secret, almost mystical faith in the marbles is dramatized through the polishing act. The final smile carries visible cost—she has staked her life’s work on an unverifiable covenant with the maze. Minor slip: the Luck official is sketched more as thematic foil than as pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara's motives are lucid: lifelong mechanic's ears tuned for pattern, now bent on lateral-time as tangible proof. Interiority (calloused hands / surgeon precision) embodies contradiction—physical laborer chasing transcendence—without stock speech. The final decision (pull lever) crystallizes values; cost is the quiet acceptance of a universe forever sideways, not glory. Earned stasis lands cleanly; no competing characters dilute focus.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her boots slosh, her bow arm becomes a “furious pendulum”—and her contradictory pull between silence and speech drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation of code-breaking for communion is earned by the escalating aqueous responses that visibly cost her awe and breath. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single-POV arc is complete and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “hollowed out and clear” state, the “baptism of ice,” the “grim peace”—but the final beat of grief for the valley feels slightly generalized, not fully earned by prior interior contradiction. Micro-choices (cleaning the lens, crawling under the station) align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Fault-tolerance as trait is dramatized through her struggle with flawed data rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction (skeptic vs. ghost-shift confrontation) manifests bodily in trembling hand and burning muscles; motives pivot mid-scene from abstract curiosity to concrete absolution, visible in Leo’s strained grunt against the valve. The cost—accepting the “immense, quiet burden”—is palpable and earned by the prior test against the valve’s fused resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Keeper’s interiority is vivid—his “loose grip on reality” and “regenerative silence” are embodied in the swan-folding ritual and the final re-folding. Motivation to witness without judgment is dramatized when he refuses to erase the knot of pain, letting it dissipate through pure observation. The cost is felt in the shattering of his habitual stillness and the labor of re-folding a new swan. One notch below 9 because the contradiction between passive witness and active burrower is asserted more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and consistent; her cautious exuberance shows in the micro-choice to risk the eclipse moment. Leo’s silence and sudden tear-tracked speech land as earned because the curl and cosmic dark re-weight his grief. The only gap: we never feel Elara’s own fear of failure, so the cost to her feels muted.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers trailing,” “pulse quickened”), but the final shift from collector to healer is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to earn the new mission, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Leo’s interior contradiction—writer of cryptic futures who never grasped his own—is dramatized the instant his own fortune boomerangs. Embodied cost is palpable when the microdot burns his palm and he steps toward the controls, renouncing the diner. Relationship crucible with Alistair is thin; one line of dialogue keeps this from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Father Ansel’s interiority reveals contradictory motives—order vs. potential—and every micro-choice (silence wall, cessation of loops, embrace of crimson) is embodied and costly. His flaw remains consistent, and the earned renunciation of stillness is visible and painful. The only drag is a slight summary lapse in how he “sees” causality within the void.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between nostalgic ache and present urgency is dramatized through micro-choices (pressing shell to glass, mapping memories). The final renunciation—homesickness replaced by arrival—earns its cost in exhaustion and kneeling collapse. Minor slip: “chronologically homesick” edges toward label-speak, though context rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—need to conquer self versus fear of ordinariness—is embodied in scene, drives every decision, and culminates in the earned merge with her echo; her leap from water to stone anchors the final cost. No traits are labeled; all revealed via micro-choice and embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for feeling yet fearing its cost—are embodied in her trembling fingertips on the drum. The micro-choice to strike the third time, arms aching, crystallizes her value hierarchy and forecloses the safety of numbness. The cost—leaving the broken needle behind—grounds her earned stasis. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s meticulous nature is embodied in the rooftop bolt and data cross-checking; her curiosity and integrity collide in the decisive act of stitching the reply. The cost—risking exposure by sending the pigeon—lands on the page. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. One slip: “credibly curious” is stated rather than dramatized early.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s wistful interiority is concrete, the simultaneous pull of scientific detachment and filial ache is embodied in shaking hands and unchecked tears. The act of breaking the wax seal crystallizes an Earned Stasis—an irrevocable forfeiture of preserved memory—visible cost in the shared silence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the rope’s tactile history and the vision of erased lives force a credible renunciation. The ethical playfulness surfaces only once (“a question in his eyes”), so the trait feels labeled rather than dramatized. The final refusal is earned and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite the thin trait usage.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“the silence a physical ache”), her motive is dramatized through micro-choices (hand in water, shift from fighting to playing with silence), and the final renunciation—accepting imperfection—carries visible cost (the pear as first fruit). The grandfather’s presence is brief but applies pressure; no relationship crucible is required. One minor slip: “magnificent simplicity” edges toward label-speak in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s clinical detachment and sudden empathic rupture are embodied in the static-charged glove and the blotter petal; the final renunciation—absorbing the client’s longing—earns its cost through prior craft pride and sensory method. Interior contradiction is vivid, though the client remains off-page, limiting relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heels clicking a brisk rhythm”), but her contradictory impulses (shrewd broker vs. sudden sentimental urgency) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to seek Henry is motivated, yet the cost feels gentle rather than sharply felt. Secondary character Henry is sketched with warmth but exerts no pressure; the relationship remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s need to belong is vivid and embodied; her hand-aching drive to weave permanence anchors motivation early and governs every beat. Interior contradiction—longing vs. fear of rootlessness—peaks in the reed-climb up obsidian; the final choice to build the lattice rather than expose the artist earns enduring, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s obsession is vivid and embodied; the brush-in-hand opening instantly fuses profession, motive, and sensory stakes. Interior contradiction—preservation vs. theft from entropy—drives every micro-choice, and the final drawing is earned by the prior time-borrow that visibly exhausts her. No other characters appear, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; single-POV interiority stays specific and avoids label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of over-articulated motive in “she believed only there could she capture…” which momentarily tells what the scene has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. grief—is embodied in the glass-eye ritual and the moment her fingers brush the mosaic; the shift from solving absence to honoring presence is earned and costly, though the brother remains off-page, limiting relational crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction—yearning to be a “presence” yet hiding—drives every micro-choice; the renunciation to remain unseen while enacting kindness feels earned because the remembered warmth of Ms. Gable viscerally substitutes for family. Embodied tension is visible as he fingers the tape, halts, pockets it, and later feels “profound visibility” without showing his face. The only cap: no on-page interaction with a second character, so relationship crucible is moot.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s shift from detached observer to participatory gardener is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tying vines, feeling moss). The internal contradiction—control vs surrender—drives every beat, culminating in the earned renunciation of her former stance. Cost is visible in her soil-smudged hands and the irreversible damage to the original trellis. Minor slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s insomnia, painterly lens, and “wryly earnest” stance are embodied in her tactile tracking of rain and her refusal to sentimentalize either past or present. The moment she clutches the brooch, her contradictory impulses—futility vs. commitment—collide in a visible micro-choice that re-weights her stance. Cost is felt when she renounces sleep and, instead, paints the convergence itself. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—clairvoyant yet blind to the pilgrim—drives the scene; the final renunciation of foresight for present wonder carries visible cost. The pilgrim’s tear and Elara’s altered sight crystallize the earned stasis. Minor: pilgrim’s motives remain slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s drive to “compile fragments into meaning” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing maker’s marks, cross-referencing logs—culminating in the charged moment she re-weights the valve as “a seed.” The contradiction between her exile and the ship’s mission is felt, not told, and her final resolve carries visible cost: she must publicly honor those who enforced her prison.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s obsession with mapping versus her fear of uncharted truths is embodied in her trembling step beyond the city grid; the confession of loneliness feels earned by the prior refusal to speak it. Interiority is concrete and specific, though the warden remains a cipher rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skeptical kindness is embodied in her trembling hand choosing to hold the tile; the contradiction between rational dismissal and empathic action drives every beat. The final act of translating feeling into form is earned by prior interior struggle and carries visible cost—the tile cools, the ledger page now holds the weight. Minor slip: “raw, courageous kindness” is slightly label-speak mid-crisis, but the embodied choice overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliana’s millennia-long ennui and buried ache are embodied in her indifference to the “prismatic escondite”; the moment she steps into the vortex, her contradictory impulses—boredom vs. the sudden spike of intrigue—collide on the page. The final renunciation of boredom and acceptance of witness-role carries visible cost: the fragment goes dark, her eternal stance irrevocably reconfigured. Interiority is specific (“crushing weight… dull, perpetual ache”) and avoids stock phrasing. Only the lack of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradiction—demanding mathematical absolution while confronting the liquidity of moral truth—is embodied and sustained; the micro-choice to recork the pot crystallizes values at visible cost. Interiority stays singular, never lapses into stock emotion. Father remains off-page; relationship pressure is conveyed via legacy objects rather than interaction, which limits relationship-as-crucible scope.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s studious solitude is vivid, but her interiority remains largely descriptive; the “refract” moment is powerful yet reads more as mystical event than earned choice, so the cost feels ambient rather than personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    K’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“a cold stone in K’s chest” after the arsenic discovery—but the shift from passive collector to active deliverer of justice is compressed into a single paragraph; the cost is felt yet the micro-choices that earn it are summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the compass-spinning panic and bone-deep cello hum anchor her contradictory impulses. The synthesis of grandfather’s data-drive and father’s craft is dramatized through her micro-choice to bow the string, paying the cost of abandoning pure myth-busting for participatory creation. One slip: the phrase “universal riddle decoded itself” edges toward explanatory shorthand rather than earned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interior contradiction—duty to founders vs paycheck from OmniCorp—drives every micro-choice; the stone’s transfer from Hem to her hand externalizes the cost of trust. Emotions are embodied (hands stained, weight of stone) rather than labeled. The final crystallization into “steady resolve” is earned because the graffiti plan and community adaptation are dramatized, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s curiosity and melancholy are embodied in her micro-choices—tweezering the grain, enduring the cold, re-mapping the glyph against stars—so her final endurance feels earned. The interior contradiction between duty and reverence is present but lightly sketched; more contradiction under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “reading” sound and pressure, the warmth of the lamp on her hands—but the client remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final micro-choice (the gold-wire bypass) is earned by prior sensory deduction and carries a visible cost: the drone’s instant flight away from her palm, severing her tactile connection. Blindness is not a label; it constrains every beat and forces inventive method. One more contradiction in her own psyche would have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s fully embodied interiority and contradictory impulses are strong, but her decisive moment (“ready to write…”) feels slightly abstract rather than dramatized; thus a hairline slip by the absolute 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s patience is embodied in her measured footsteps and listening bones; her interiority is consistent and particular. The final walk is a credible, earned crystallization of her trait. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc is slightly one-note. Still, the cost—her solitary labor and the fleeting nature of the restoration—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her memories of Jupiter, puzzle-solving satisfaction—but the sender remains a cipher until after contact; we get no prior view of her mind under pressure from the sender’s impending death. The instinct override is stated more than dramatized, reducing felt sacrifice. Still, the exchange of memories reads as a hard-earned trade-off that crystallizes a mutual witness.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and specific (“glass cage where the great, dead eye…watched me”), but the final renunciation—speaking truth into the lattice—relies on a sudden, abstract epiphany rather than a visible cost paid on the page. The contradiction between inherited guilt and self-authored truth is dramatized, yet the moment of containment feels slightly under-motivated because the lattice’s rules are revealed only at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-stricken guidance and Leo’s reluctant stewardship crystallise in the final moment of recognition; however, her inner contradiction—protective venom vs spectral self-erasure—leans more toward summary than embodied scene. One hairline slip: the interiority in “lovingly venomous precision” is a label not an enactment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—practical mender vs. mythic restorer—surface in the embodied act of “sewing stone,” but the interior split is stated more than dramatized until the final stitch. The sleepwalking inheritance is evocative yet functions as inherited magic rather than a flaw that complicates her choice. Still, her calloused fingers, net, and song give her a distinct perceptual signature, and the earned ache at dawn carries cost. Cap stays at 8.7 because no interior contradiction actively threatens success inside the critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and particular—her fingertips trace inscriptions, her feet find “subtle pathways,” her resolve is “iron.” The contradiction between reverence and need drives every micro-choice. The final peace is earned by prior causality, but the cost (physical strain, emotional risk) is stated more than felt, keeping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his tactile craving for ink and paper, the tremor when he signs “Arthur Hale”—but the contradiction between forger and archaeologist of intention is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final beat earns a credible renunciation: he mails the letter knowing the chalk key will vanish, accepting the fragility of the very meaning he unearths. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her needle as “tiny conductor,” the candle’s cold light revealing thread secrets—but her contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final choice to risk ridicule at the gate is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost. Secondary characters (young guard) apply pressure that alters the state of the relationship in one beat. Minor slip: “galaxy-chart embroiderer” is label-heavy; the work itself shows the vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority—“cryptic medium” made visceral—dominates; contradictory wants to both seek and defer apology live in embodied action (wading, pressing leaf). One slip: “skin healed in moonlight” never constrains choice on page, so falls short of 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the coral as memory-anchor and the translator’s reflex to “unknot” trauma are credible. The boy’s first spoken word lands as earned micro-choice. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the tear on his cheek. Minor slip: “lotus-hearted ache” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “quiet, desperate ache” and the ghost-taste of apricot anchor motive. The micro-choice to use ruined film as pigment crystallizes her arc. Cost is felt when the light fades and the installation dissolves, leaving only the fragment and the faces of strangers. A hairline slip: “knowledge network ignited” edges toward convenient epiphany rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “methodically playful” testing of plaster and the fox nickel as talisman—but the moment of decision (chipping the sculpture) arrives more as inherited destiny than earned contradiction; cost is felt yet not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lysander’s interiority is vivid—his “vibrant garden of unregistered ideas” and the moment he “understood” amid green/red chaos show embodied contradiction. Motivation (“stand guard over your own spark”) drives every beat, culminating in the deliberate self-sacrifice of destroying his code. Micro-choices (shaking the rattle in a single furious rhythm, kneeling with crushed lavender) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The only minor slip is Hemlock’s cryptic aphorisms feel slightly ornamental rather than crucible-level pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “quiet, persistent madness” and “second heartbeat” compulsion are concrete. Micro-choice—curling into the alcove, clutching the postcard—aligns with motive. The final sleep is earned by prior agony and visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiorization of “foxglove regret” and the felt doom of the library’s final silence gives her renunciation of passive caretaking into active remembrance bite; her humming shift carries palpable cost as the bamboo threads deeper each time, all cleanly tied to the climax. The humming choice fuses contradictory drives: preservation vs. recognition. No slips.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied dread, tactile reverence, the tremor in her wrist as ink meets glyph. Contradictory impulses (reverence vs. reckless intrusion) coexist in-scene, driving the micro-choice to speak the first vow aloud. The earned cost is the near-empty well and dawn’s pale rival—trust restored at the price of solitude ended. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—technical precision vs. reverence for the living mountain—are dramatized in micro-choices (chain placement, console reroute) with embodied cost. The final renunciation of Kael’s binary logic is earned by prior causality and carries visible exhaustion. Interiority is concrete, but one moment of diagnostic self-label (“compassion often wore desperate disguises”) nudges the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—her craving for isolation versus the geologist’s plea—are dramatized in the moment she descends the attic stairs. The embodied cost of re-entering trust is visible in the trembling hands and direct eye contact at the post office. One slip: the phrase “preserve the echo of lost songs” edges toward label-speak rather than lived memory.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s maternal drive is embodied and specific—her “featherly determination” is tested by the prism terrace and crystallizes into steel when she deciphers the grain-map. Leo’s off-stage presence still exerts pressure through the logbook and drawings, making the relationship a crucible. The final embrace earns its poignancy because both characters’ knowledge states and emotional costs are legible. Minor slip: “featherly” leans label-adjacent, though the image is carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s need to belong is embodied in her breath and gaze; the feather triggers panic, the fireflies slow it—visible micro-choice. Ronan’s silent presence adds status pressure that eases rather than complicates, a missed crucible. The final renunciation of the feather as “just a relic” is earned by the rhythmic shift, but the cost feels gentle rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for truth yet fearing its cost—surface in the micro-choice to plant the seedling. The final smile carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the captain’s psyche is filtered through summary rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Eli’s desire for “orchestrated serendipity” is clear and motivates every chess move, but the woman’s shift from passerby to co-author happens too smoothly; her interior remains off-page, weakening the earned cost of the final refusal. Her gentle refusal of checkmate is touching yet reads more as authorial grace than as a decision born of her own contradictions. Flawed yet readable; meets high-band ambition at Q1.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between stillness and remembered dance is palpable. Motivation to “pen a cosmic verse” is clear and drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—exile becomes portable cosmos—earns its cost on the page. Minor slip: “obsidian grace” leans label-speak mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt its weight, its history”), but the story never forces him to act against his core motive; the final smile is too frictionless. No contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page, so the “earned” change feels asserted rather than suffered.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scar, the ash, the porcelain box all press against her contradictory impulses. The bargain of innocence for life is dramatized through her micro-choice to release the ashes, not merely stated. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Only a slight over-articulation of “translate pain into universal language” nicks the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's interiority—"serene upheaval blossomed into fierce, quiet joy"—is embodied and specific, tied to tactile work. Motivation (equations for hope) stays coherent, but no contradictory impulse surfaces mid-scene to sharpen the trade-off; the revision reads almost friction-less.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s sensitivity (hearing stone-whispers) is embodied; her interiority “walls dream” motive is reiterated twice but translates into decisive reading of diaries and listening “in the sighing corner.” One jump—feeling Lysander’s fear instantly—is shorthand rather than embodied choice; still, her final assumption of stewardship is credible closure with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s obsession is embodied in every micro-choice; the borrowed heartbeat syncs breath to action, grounding interiority. The final stilling of that heartbeat is a felt cost that forecloses further illusion. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Interior contradiction—hope vs. frustration—plays out in real time, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “calloused yet gentle” hands and the moment she feels the cost in Kaelen’s eyes crystallize her contradictory impulses. The final renunciation—accepting a scarred peace—earns its cost through prior grief. Minor slip: “operatively gentle” reads like a dossier label rather than lived texture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven destruction vs. secret tenderness—are dramatized in the tactile handling of the egg and the final refusal to shatter it. The interiority is specific and embodied; the warmth he imagines in the shell is a precise, character-bound hallucination. The renunciation costs him the designed echo and leaves a visible debt, satisfying the closure test. Minor slip: “amoral philanthropist” is label-adjacent, though the contradiction is quickly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—compliant courtesan vs. awakened seeker—is embodied in the first paragraph and crystallizes in the final unperformed smile. The micro-choice to pluck starlight threads is specific and stakes her identity. Yet the “harvest of echoes” remains abstract; we feel the cost conceptually rather than viscerally, blunting the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ink-perfectionist vs. puppet-provocateur—is dramatized in the stick-turn micro-choice; the renunciation of “clean truth” costs her prior professional identity, felt in the line “her method was forever changed.” Serenity trait shifts from defensive armor to tactical instrument, showing embodied cost. Could edge higher if the puppet-shows were on-page rather than recalled.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet resolve and precise caretaking mark her as singular; the moment of outstretched hand and silk knot is embodied, contradictory, and fully earned. Motivation—honoring the overlooked—steadies every micro-choice under rising pressure until the final renunciation records her presence, leaves her root, and accepts the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “technically gentle” touch and the micro-choice to unpick the rope both reveal motive and cost. The forgiveness backstory is brief, anchored to the present task, and tilts her stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Internal conflict—the collision of directive decay vs. emergent dream-propelled will—is dramatized in micro-choices (alarm override → pressing wafer seal). Embodied tension in the overheating processors and tactile peeling of vines. Self-contradiction drives the story with visible cost: the literal disintegration of Foresight Hindsight as she becomes the forest.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kalanu’s frugality and empirical irony are embodied in worn robes and vellum charts; his contradictory awe and calculation collide in the moment he chooses guardianship over control. The priestess supplies immediate relational pressure, forcing a stance shift. Final renunciation is earned: he accepts the burden of warden-ship, cost visible in the tile’s new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s pacifist scheming is shown through calm manipulation of Kael, but her interiority drifts into thematic exposition (“the true source of the pain”). Kael’s resentment is embodied in the sword hand and shoulder tension, and his micro-choice to release the breath lands as earned stasis. The broken cylinder’s reappearance trait is stated, not tested, so its causality is thin. Overall, credible change with visible cost, but some emotional labeling dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s obsession is embodied in every breath and tool-choice; the shift from hunter to host is earned through escalating micro-decisions under pressure. The interior contradiction—tangible artisan chasing intangible beauty—drives each beat. Final renunciation of capture for invitation carries visible cost as the sextant crumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s interior state is lucid—betrayal, memory of Lyra, and the deciduous-vow reframe all push clear micro-choices (pilfering the lens shards, climbing the pillar, tying the ribbon). Embodied emotion registers (soot-stained apron, mortar-grit fingers). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: surrender to the Guild’s verdict, irrevocable pivot to a new spectral lens. Relationship crucible is modest—only Lyra appears late to soften anger into shared wonder—but the generational bridge is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs institutional taboo) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to eat the fruit is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the cameo now bears her profile. Minor slip: “philosophical panic” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied reaction (“skin prickle”) rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from hunter to surrender is dramatized through micro-choices (sitting to read the diary as confession). The time traveler remains a flickering prop rather than a second character, so relationship crucible is absent. Flaws (arrogance, impatience) are shown via future-self indictment, not just labels. Final renunciation carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking a lost twin who is herself—drives every beat; the emerald card’s re-weighting from memento to shard of self is embodied and costly. The final weaving-back is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional price. Minor slip: “blissfully aberrant” is asserted more than dramatized until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “warmly methodical” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing braids, re-centering knot) and drives the decisive act; the cost—bearing dangerous knowledge alone—is legible in the final beat. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. No contradictory impulses shown in scene, so 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Mapkeeper’s interiority is textured—her “ripple-marked” skin and “hammered repose” embody her lifelong vocation and present anxiety. Motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) is dramatized through tactile micro-choices: tracing walls, kneeling, whispering pure tone. The climactic realization that “they had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized” is earned by prior struggle and carries visible cost—the old maps are obsolete. Minor slip: the final shift from mapkeeper to “keeper of equilibrium” is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s defiant “weed” motivation is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing star charts, lifting the prism—yet the retrocognition trait is more label than lived constraint; no moment shows it complicating tactics or exacting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority pulses through embodied contradiction: the ache in her bones when the fog hardens, the quiver in the summer-quill as it warms. Her “premptively nostalgic” trait moves from ornament to constraint when she must decide whether to inscribe her own regret; the cost is her acceptance that keeperhood *is* her sole identity. Voice and choice stay coherent—no diagnostic speak, no easy epiphany, just the hush-laden price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s resolve is embodied in micro-choices—feeling the courtyard, grinding powders, tracing the mosaic. Doubt surfaces as embodied chill, then is overridden by the remembered command, locking motive to final act. No cliché interiority; cost is the wager of light against night. The only lag is the historian client being a wisp off-stage, not pressuring her.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to hide in the grotto vs. risk the relationship) are dramatized in the moment she offers the cicada. The final micro-choice—handing it to Aric—earns the shift from “hiding place” to “observatory” with visible relational cost. Minor slip: Aric’s interior pivot is asserted rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and notebook ritual are embodied early; the porcelain doll anchors her panic and later reweights identity. Interior contradiction—fear vs. wonder—peaks when she forces her eyes open to catalog the new silence. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she abandons her father’s bunker-logic and her childhood anchor. Only minor slip: “no longer her father’s daughter” is slightly abstract summary rather than dramatized renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s motive—teaching silence to comfort—is dramatized through micro-choices (touching the vial, modulating voice) and embodied emotion (her breathing matching the crystals). The stranger’s visible softening proves her agency and cost. Interior contradiction is slight but present: she must re-enter noise to keep teaching. Voice remains consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his “drum against his ribs” and the “lonely frequency” of the throne anchor contradictory impulses of caution and desperation. The final renunciation of the orchard throne for the galactic vantage is earned by the mural excavation and ruby-guided ascent, with visible cost in the dissolving flake. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the single POV is coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—she both guards and tests, burns and teaches. Kael’s scars externalize his motive without cliché. The final breath is earned, but the “specter behind the glass” beat is slightly over-articulated, nudging the score down from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's survivor status, virtuous mischief, and post-cash motivations are dramatized through her touch-response to the bolt and the embodied refusal to monetize the diamond; the interior contradiction (“not profit but wonder”) shows under the crushing sub pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s desire to unearth the secret is textured through embodied interiority (the “weight” of the ledgers versus the physical hum in her bones), and her relief at discovering liberation rather than wealth lands with felt cost: she accepts herself as “conclusion,” not heir. Minor slips: two abstract pulses—“dynasty ender” and “gilded cage” lean diagnostic rather than embodied, though not enough to derail causality.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s quiet sorrow and “tactfully hopeful diligence” are embodied in micro-choices—how he handles brittle pages, reads dust patterns, and decides to re-file the photograph. The interior contradiction between penance and hope is dramatized, not labeled, and the final resolve to “hold other small, kind histories” is earned by the preceding discovery. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “heart hammered against her ribs” as she weighs safety vs. resistance. The contradiction between panic and resourcefulness is dramatized in micro-choices (puddle map, culvert drop). The final endurance/renunciation (“she would reappear tomorrow”) forecloses retreat with felt cost. One hairline slip: “bedraggled woman walking home” is a label rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fatigue is “more spiritual than physical,” her longing “for a past she’d never known.” The micro-choice to play silence as weapon is credible and costly. Yet the grandfather backstory is delivered in a single expository block that slightly dilutes present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “mossy delight” and stained fingers ground her—but the shift from passive decoder to active sower is asserted more than dramatized; the final plunge reads slightly convenient rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied awe and the cost of abandoning order carry enough felt weight to satisfy the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—precision versus embrace of uncertainty—anchors every beat. The pattern-breaking clocks translate directly into her decisive pivot from repair to planting. No drift in motivation; all choices spring from established traits. Closure renounces the certainty she once prized, felt in the warm brass weight becoming a seed-map.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tear striking the coin is a precise, character-specific moment. The contradiction between empirical alchemist and mystical seeker is dramatized in her ritual, not stated. The final renunciation of “lost” for “guardian” is earned by the vision and carries visible emotional cost. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “modest fearlessness” is embodied in the calm way she handles the crocodile tooth. The contradiction between her duty’s weight and the lightness she seeks is dramatized when the gorge’s ache lifts at the laughter. Micro-choice: the minute twist of the tooth under pressure. Cost: the luminous ache she carries is made visible in the final line, now “touched with a new, hopeful light.”

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is embodied and character-specific; the trauma responses feel lived-in. The shift from endurance to mercy is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (noting fractals, releasing strap). The final renunciation lands with visible cost, though the mathematics metaphor flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the translator’s contradictory pull between detachment and compulsion is embodied in the hand-to-glass moment. The final choice—to absorb the keeper’s daughter’s story—carries visible cost (loss of distance) and is foreshadowed by the “honor” motive. One slip: the merchant’s line is exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Leo’s benevolent ghost-whispering adds interior contradiction—duty versus fear—and every tactile detail (dust, brass, mainspring) is filtered through his obsessive technician’s lens; the ghost’s smile at fade-out earns his arc without epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—fingers on spines, the cold press lever—yet her interiority stays abstract (“compress eternity into a single, tangible moment”). The final beat earns her renunciation: she becomes the moment, a credible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Still, the contradiction between her decades of study and the near-effortless success blunts flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—revolutionary turned archaeologist of remorse—drives every micro-choice; the shard’s discovery and her re-translation enact a credible renunciation of vengeance with visible cost in the final image. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “wilts near dishonesty” trait is dramatized through physical collapse. Motivation to reclaim light is consistent and intensifies under pressure. The final choice—tethering her spirit—carries visible cost (nausea, buckling knees) and earns the restoration of the song. Minor slip: the soldier’s backstory is delivered in summary rather than dramatized choice, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s eccentricity is shown through embodied choices—only opening after the factory hush, refusing to jar the impossible scent—so the trait drives action. Interior contradiction surfaces when awe collides with collector’s instinct, resolved by renunciation that costs his life’s work. Micro-choice (taking the breath, not the jar) crystallizes hierarchy of values. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interiority sharp; embodied panic (“knuckles white” “heart frantic drum”) grounds Elara’s transformation from mere sculptor to timewoven chronicler, yet her shift to passive receptor during the alliance vision nudges agency down a tick.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—pigment-stained hands, postcard inheritance—but her “quiet drive” is asserted more than dramatized; the decisive kneel and hairpin choice show agency, yet the emotional cost feels slightly under-embodied in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias’s scholarly compulsion and embodied shock after the retrocognitive seizure are vivid and specific; interior contradiction surfaces when reverence for truth collides with fear of re-entry. The final covenant—transcribing her words—feels earned by his earlier physical willingness to brave the sentinel, anchoring growth with visible cost. No secondary on-page character, so relationship crucible not tested; single POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots “whisper” through dust, the bottle’s weight is an “anchor”—but the final beat of watching echoes “live, love, and simply be” drifts into summary rather than a micro-choice that crystallizes cost. The contradiction between rejecting false comfort and building a monument to it is present but not fully dramatized in a single decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood memory of the library hum anchors her vocation and later choice. The contradiction between duty to archive and duty to protect is embodied in the trembling hand that holds the wax shaving. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the melting curl’s scent of “honey and extinction.” Only the brief “venerable” label feels slightly stock, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “furiously tranquil” duality drives the micro-choices that coax the vortex. The final cradling of the acorn cap crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to warn vs. reverence for listening—is embodied in her micro-choices (knotting rope, then releasing it). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits institutional safety and accepts personal blame, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is vivid—his spiritual curiosity and awe are embodied in the moment he grips the glass—yet the interior contradiction (stillness vs. violent empathic surrender) is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—he continues the vigil with his body literally vibrating with the afterburn of star-death—carries felt cost and earns closure, though the arc remains slightly under-imagined in micro-choices along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “quiet, stubborn thing” and “mute eloquence” reveal motive without label-speak. The micro-choice to kneel and offer silent understanding crystallizes his arc and carries visible cost (the covenant’s completion absorbs him). Ghost-woman and ghost-bees exert pressure, but they are not second on-page characters, so relationship crucible is N/A. The only drag is a brief “he understood their purpose” summary that could be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses—cataloguing death while craving continuity—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the shard, pricing the lamp). The final renunciation of panic in favor of timeless custodianship is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: the attic woman is more device than crucible, muting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “warmly attentive” trait drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—accepting the broken as whole—earns its cost through prior causality. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s “gentle systematics” and “brazen calm” are embodied in every micro-choice—wrapping copper, aligning wires, closing the diary—so her final renunciation feels inevitable. Interiority is concrete and particular; no stock phrases intrude. The cost is visceral: the act drains the last of her life, a price scaled to the word count. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's luminous skepticism is vividly embodied in tactile beats (finger on damp sill, prying the amber) and micro-choice (placing amber on crystal with felt cost); interior contradiction—fierce analytic drive vs emerging resonance—is sustained without epiphany shortcut; academic rebellion threads through action (loss of post traded for data pursuit) and converges with earned stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elias’s interiority—his comfort in dead tongues, his tactile handling of the pods, his pivot from ritual to caretaking—rings specific and earned. The moment he crumbles the pods into soil for the bird rather than the battlefield crystallizes a contradictory impulse (hope vs. duty) with visible cost. His flaw (solitude through obsolete speech) is confronted by the living chirp, forcing an unplanned alliance. The shift from lone sower to co-gardener is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas's interiority is embodied through scent and bone-level vibration; his desire to shrink distance into closeness compels every beat, culminating in a credible renunciation that costs him motion for love.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from confusion to curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (charcoal moving, eyes catching the star). The compass rose and folio act as concrete anchors for memory and motive. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost—she renounces the old fixed “true north” and accepts the burden of perpetual navigation. One notch below 9.0 only because the contradiction between paralysis and agency could be sharper in mid-scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara's yearning to "embrace the unknown" drives her pivot from mercenary thief to guardian—visible when she shatters the obsidian and reseats the queen. The apprentice’s one-line divine is sufficient pressure. Some interiority drifts toward explanatory epiphany ("To embrace the unknown was not to steal it...") and could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s historian-mission and Kael’s benevolent ruthlessness are embodied in concrete micro-choices (her finger on the pawn void, his risk in returning the pieces). Interior contradiction is present but compressed; the final placement of the pawn crystallizes her stance with visible cost. The relationship pressure is brief yet alters both characters’ trajectories. A hairline slip: Kael’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for home yet nightly erasing memory—is embodied in the ritual and the stone’s refusal to vanish. The moment her thumb touches the glyphs after the feather, memory erupts and redefines her motive; the cost is the searing return of pain she had long numbed. Final micro-choice—picking up the feather to begin seeding—earns the shift from avoidance to vocation. One slip: “quiet, desperate pull” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in tactile fidgeting and the platinum weight; contradictory impulses (pride vs. surrender) play out in scene. The final micro-choice—pressing the plate in humility—earns the closure and carries visible cost (release of anguish). Reflection stays under 20 % and is anchored to present handling of labyrinth and tapestry. Only slight reserve: the “fierce repose” label edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kaelen's interiority is vivid and embodied; his contradictory impulses—defiance vs. the clan's safety—coexist in the same beats. The final renunciation of his voice lands with felt cost. Minor: "innocently mischievous" is stated rather than dramatized in the present crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—despair vs. hope, fear vs. resolve—are embodied in her trembling hands and the warm charm; the final renunciation (accepting the workshop’s loss while redeeming the statue) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “she was narrating a biography of loss,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—nostalgic fixation vs. the vow to paint “the truly felt”—is embodied in her micro-choices: securing the window, taking the wrong turn, painting the shell. The final renunciation (leaving the painted shell) costs her the cave itself, sealing the promise with tangible loss. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the vial cork and beckoning gesture crystallize her quiet-versus-loud credo. The keeper’s single shout supplies external pressure, but he remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is thin. The final beat—cobalt beam purifying intent—earns her stance with visible cost (fatigue, risk of failure). One contradictory impulse (duty vs. whispered faith) plays out in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (need to map loss vs. raw pain of moon-acute perception) play out in real time. The bronze censer foot anchors her tactile memory and later becomes the pivot of her improvised pendulum, showing motive-to-action alignment. The final smile is earned: she accepts permanent immobility in exchange for a new way to “chart the void,” a visible cost. Minor slip: the voice on the radio is more oracle than second character, so relationship crucible is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s craving for psychological safety is embodied in every muddy step and every involuntary truth she utters; the contradiction between her need for isolation and the viral empathy that betrays her is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation—choosing to bury the weapon with a stranger—earns its cost because earlier beats show how desperately she sought any barrier against the collective scream. Minor slip: the “rational truffle forager” label is asserted rather than proven by on-page expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied—his breath, the flower’s weight, the mirrored isolation. The final act of laying the boutonnière on the mantel is a credible renunciation that costs him the borrowed story and re-anchors his solitude. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s loneliness and promise-driven compulsion are embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing ants, clutching the chip—so her final decision to slot the “W” feels earned. The contradiction between empirical skepticism and intuitive faith is dramatized rather than stated. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of the known past for an unknown future. Minor deduction for a touch of summary loneliness early on.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath coming in ragged clouds”), motivation singular and intensifying. The final renunciation of crown for keeper role is earned, but the spirit’s instant knowledge transfer feels slightly convenient, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—fear of loss vs. acceptance of release—play out in embodied micro-choices (cradling the star, aligning the shell). The final renunciation of containment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the star’s form is forever altered). Kael’s single whispered line applies pressure without stealing agency. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—archivist’s compulsion vs. existential dread—is embodied in micro-choices (writing on bark, leaving the scroll). The final renunciation of passive chronicling for active climbing is earned by the dream’s cost. Minor slip: “jaded wonder” is named rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the loss of smell is dramatized through tactile memory and micro-choices. The midwife-screw becomes a charged object that reframes her vocation. Final renunciation—shifting from aroma to presence—earns its cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara’s interiority—“to transform the scar…into a story of strength”—drives every beat; the crystallization attribute, panic, and subsequent superstition-led “shedding choice” crystallize contradictory impulses under pressure and force a visible cost (renunciation of old self-shield) that lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s apology motive is clear and embodied; her shame and Leo’s grief are palpable. The micro-choice to use her exorcist skill as reparative act is credible. Yet Leo’s interiority is only implied, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority glints with precise contradiction—dictionary as “anchor against drifting tides” while she drifts inward—but emotions remain slightly abstract (“purpose, carved into her very being”). The earned price is implicit (cosmic balance preserved), yet embodied physicality is spare; micro-choice hierarchy is visible in her spiral-guided speech.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silas’s conflict—seek to shepherd precision vs doubt its very purpose—drives every move; interior contradiction is embodied as hesitation, embodied squint and keyed decision reversing the escapement. Earned renunciation of a full shutdown locks the clock to endure stone’s bite, sealing last-minute resolution visible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—control vs. letting go—is embodied in micro-choices (hovering over the panic button, envying the stranger’s ease). The final renunciation of the laser pointer is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary pressure from the stranger is subtle but present, forcing her stance shift. A hairline slip: “envied the easy way he touched the world” drifts toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—mathematical certainty vs. inherited chaos—drives every beat; the tremor when she lights the lantern embodies the cost. Her refusal to forgive yet need to understand is dramatized, not labeled. The final extinguishing of the candle is a credible renunciation that forecloses the path of resentment with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s quiet creed and ritualized listening are embodied through micro-choices (spinning the disc, placing the receiver beside it) that reveal a hierarchy of values; the final “perfect, balanced note” crystallizes his earned stasis with visible cost—he remains alone, bearing every story. Interiority is specific and restrained, avoiding therapy-speak. The contradictory impulse—intimacy through deliberate estrangement—drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to permanence vs personal sacrifice—drives every micro-choice; her gently thorough trait chokes alternative shortcuts and forces exacting action under pressure, earning the renunciation at the jetty.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s jocular mask and buried ache are shown through crisp, embodied beats; the moon-rock transfer and rumor-engine pivot feel earned because her prior isolation is dramatized, not declared. The final choice to “distribute grace” costs her her anonymity—visible price on the page—yet the interior contradiction between logistician control and emotional exposure could be pushed one notch sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s blind mapmaker persona—her physical reliance on touch to perceive an unseen world, her rejection of land-based cartography in favor of emotional geography, her quiet resolve to chart the heart rather than coastlines—is embodied in every action: the vellum under fingertips, the ring against skin, each barefoot step that drinks vibration. Micro-choices (following a single note left or right, lowering palm to monolith) align motive with embodied cost. The only slight drag is early biographical summary (“the Institute had cast her out...”) which is told in two sentences, yet it seeds the motive and the ring gift, so cost outruns summary.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aris’s regret and the “confidently uncertain” trait are embodied in his obsessive decoding and the tremor when the anomaly mirrors his mistake. The pen’s insertion is a micro-choice that crystallizes his shift from shame to acceptance, but the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“he understood then”) rather than sustained contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet, constant hum” and the embodied sorrow/joy tension are specific. The grandfather’s presence is memory-made-flesh, not exposition. Micro-choice (raising the blind camera) aligns with motive. Cost is felt in the final solitude: the music is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—destructive fire vs. curatorial rescue—are dramatized in every beat; the final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost as she leaves the tapestry exposed. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“volcanic tenderness,” “magma” urge). Micro-choices (selective burning, crowbar, final hanging) reveal a hierarchy of values. The vandalized self-portrait arc is fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elara’s interiority embodies the collision between her autonomy and the alien memories—her drumming choices externalize the conflict without authorial lecture. The sorrow is viscerally felt, yet the moment of fusion with Kael’s brief apparition earns its ache by costing her the shared future it promises.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s obsession with whispers vs. shouts is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to send the encrypted query is earned. Interiority is concrete (“quiet, burning obsession”) but leans toward summary rather than simultaneous contradiction. Competence is balanced by genuine risk: the rival’s tread is felt, the storm is real. The final smile carries cost—she has won attention but perhaps surrendered anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s motives are legible and consistent; his “teach darkness the value of stars” is dramatized through the mirror and shutter lessons. Elian’s arc from mute fear to active weaving is embodied and earned, with trembling hands and aching arms as cost. The mentor-student status shift is staged through gesture and rope transfer, not exposition. One minor slip: “spiralingly calm” is repeated without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mr. Aris’s interiority is vivid—his “long and precise” fingers, the “deafening roar of surrender” he hears—yet the contradiction between his stated goal (plant forests of second thoughts) and the actual demonstration (town-wide spectacle) is never dramatized as internal conflict; the cost is felt by Leo, not Aris, so the earned change is slightly displaced.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Arden’s longing for the impossible is viscerally embodied (fluid grace vs claustrophobic prison), but the “releasing of name and history” beats get summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, blurring the felt cost on the page. The contradictory impulses—yearning vs surrender—are named more than shown colliding at the moment of unspooling.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blank-faced performer’s interiority is embodied through ritualized micro-choices—counting chews, narrating chores—that externalize his grief-mask. His contradictory impulse to mourn while feigning mandated joy is dramatized in scene, culminating in the un-narrated carving of memory. The final renunciation of mandated lightness for authentic grief is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the whittled bird and shed tears. Only minor slip: “morally ambiguous protest” is stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s need to dissolve boundaries is visceral—palms sinking into quartz crystallizes motive. Micro-choice at pillar accepts exile’s memories, fuses stone’s endurance with her prior pain; cost (loss of prior rigid identity) registers before closure. However, status dynamics and secondary pressure absent; interiority remains rich yet solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—yearning for beauty while trapped in grey—drives every micro-choice; the plant-communication gift is embodied, not labeled, and the final sight of red costs him the lifelong lens through which he painted. Kaela’s “interesting failures” credo reframes his flaw as virtue, forcing a trade that crystallizes both characters’ stakes. The only cap is the slight summary tilt in the final paragraph; a hairline slip keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from “hollow relic” to “weaver of audial golden shadows” is earned through micro-choices with the lens. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the arc feels tidy rather than torn. Still, the cost of renouncing her old title is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in her still hands and dusty workshop; the micro-choice to follow the cranes is credible. Interiority is specific, but the shift from paralysis to “blooming” feels slightly compressed—more stated than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is crisp and embodied, especially in her hand reaching for the tape; the contradiction between scholarly detachment and visceral inheritance fuels her final resolve. The cost is visible in the “greater purpose” that forecloses her former anonymity, but Leo is kept off-stage enough that emotional stakes center on Elara alone. One minor slip: ‘intellectual curiosity’ flirts with label-speak in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs. psychic self-preservation—are dramatized in her zig-zag navigation and the veil’s failure. The embodied cost (grief-joy shards) is palpable, and her final acceptance reads as earned renunciation of innocence. Minor slack: the “burning compulsion” is asserted rather than shown in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her luminous regret and fierce hope collide in the final dream-construction, costing her a “peculiar draining.” The river-stone grounding and micro-choice to build an original dream earn the change. Only the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—anger vs compassion—shown through micro-choices like mixing adhesive instead of raging. The tail-repair decision crystallizes her reconfigured self-respect/compassion weave, with visible cost (time, precision, emotional exposure). Minor slip: “reconstruct her own fractured principles” edges toward label-speak, though it’s brief.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking closure by reopening wounds—drives every beat; the glowing scars moment crystallizes her cost. Telepathy with plants is embodied (tea spill, root screams) and alters tactics. The final press against the orb is earned by prior pain and plant pleas, foreclosing escape into numbness. Minor slip: “closure seeker who only succeeded in opening wounds” is slightly label-speak, not embodied mid-action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination is embodied in the tactile way she handles the film and the booth. The projectionist’s unspoken love is rendered through specific, sensory choices (ink-stained fingers, velvet rope). The final hand-off crystallizes a lifetime of waiting with visible cost on both women. Minor slip: the client’s reaction is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s longing and interior contradiction are vivid, but the shift from external striving to cosmic surrender is so abrupt that the cost of her renunciation (“conscious stillness”) doesn’t feel fully accrued—she gives up the chase two sentences after discovering she never had to pursue.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s dreamlessness and conditioning are embodied and visible—her mind a "still lake." Interior contradiction surfaces subtly when protocol clashes with an "unacceptable" spark. The final acceptance of custodianship is rooted in earlier traits: her emptiness is exactly why she withstands archive overload. The cost is visible—she remains, forever—in an Earned Stasis that fulfills the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between fear of malfunction and trust in the hum is dramatized in micro-choices (pocketing the gear, stepping forward). The final renunciation—leaving physical form—carries visible cost and is seeded by prior beats. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s grief is embodied in hollowed-out silence and the glowing star; his micro-choice to climb despite exhaustion crystallizes the internal shift. The guides remain archetypal, but their pressure on Elias is immediate and stakes-shaping. The final image—star dimming as courage is reclaimed—earns the change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interior “sharp cold needle” and Leo’s embodied silence both act under pressure, but the reflection‐splice from the architect’s journal keeps her conflict largely interpretive rather than lived in the same on-page turn. The “remember but not be silent” micro-choice lands, yet the emotional cost is more intellectual pivot than visceral wound.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“delicate yet strong as stone”), her centuries-long patience collides with the single decisive act of spitting on the pellet, and the cost—quiet exhaustion after the drift—is felt. The contradiction between regal bearing and child-size form is shown, not told. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Motivation is clear and intensifies to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—his tapping, the reef memory, the slow shift from “discover” to “testament” all feel earned. The contradiction between witness and archivist is embodied in micro-choices (taping the page, slowing the tap). Cost is visible in the final, deliberate beat. Minor: the “periodically eternal” label is more asserted than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s barefoot stance and opera-glass ritual embody her obsessive search for pattern; the hum crystallizes her awkward confidence into decisive witness. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and drives the final choice to summon the cell. The cost—abandoning her private stargazing to become public catalyst—is legible but not yet viscerally paid, keeping her just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet insurgency and plant-telepathy are embodied through tactile micro-choices (tracing script, cupping amber, humming to moss); the final renunciation—grafting the past onto the future—carries visible cost in her defiance of the council. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the “quiet fire” summary edges toward label-speak. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies to the decisive act. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—terror vs. the need to plant—are embodied in the freeze/anchor beat; the photograph’s re-weighting at the end shows earned endurance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, somatic, and avoids therapy-speak. Only the “quietly talented” label remains ornamental, never tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, the “archivist of ruin” stance—yet the shift from despair to synthesis is slightly under-motivated; the cost of her new stance is implied rather than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s serene anger is embodied in every micro-choice; the shift from obsession to renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority is precise, never diagnostic. The final “disappear into the pattern” crystallizes her arc with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—frozen discipline versus burning need—embodies an archivist who chooses treason. The moment she bypasses the comms terminal to plant the digital ghost crystallizes her decisive arc. Embodied emotion (heartbeat hammering, thermal gloves grazing the letter) turns abstract stakes into visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—violent lineage vs imposed pacifism—are dramatized in live beats: the conscious swap of seeds for bone slivers under threat, the micro-choice to face rather than flee, the soldier’s trembling handing her his weapon. There is a visible, embodied cost: her father’s sandbag scrap becomes the literal pouch for peace, the rose offered to the soldier is stripped of thorns as if disarming her past. One slip: the tag “from the fallen tower” reads too expositional. Still, earned quiet as the renounced road feels on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s cool-headedness is embodied in micro-choices (zigzag path, steady breath) and contradicted by the private ache he absorbs from the goddess’s echo; the final renunciation—accepting her sorrow into silence—costs him the garden’s old song and is earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—devotion to legacy vs. need for truth—is embodied in the pen’s weight and the archival hunt; the final act of writing a confession is earned and carries visible cost. The “orbits of regret” metaphor is more thematic label than lived contradiction, slightly diluting immediacy. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with credible flaw-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied and specific; the amber ritual crystallizes her arc. The mentor’s absence limits relational crucible, but her self-confrontation is credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with the ghosts of a hundred rainbows”), but her socially-perceptive trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final interjection is elegant yet feels slightly convenient because the tile’s agency supersedes hers. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene; the arc is more emblematic than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s “gentle radical” paradox is embodied in every micro-choice; the retrocognitive flash floods her with artisanal joy, forcing a visible shift from enforcer to guardian. Her steel arms literally cradle the tessera and then the child—an earned, costly reversal that forecloses her prior obedience. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory; no stock phrasing. Only the lieutenant remains a cipher, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for witness yet fearing finality—surface in the moment she chooses to “pour more of herself” into the memory, a micro-choice that visibly costs her spectral cohesion. Leo’s synesthetic perception is embodied (taste of blood, scent of hemp) and drives his decision to kneel and anchor rather than flee. The final bow is earned because every echo has tightened the stakes toward acknowledgment, not escape. Only the slight abstraction of “spectral core” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. longing—drives every beat; the pill choice and geode handling are embodied micro-choices that foreclose her prior creative paralysis with visible cost (the heart-shaped light web). The memory recall is dramatized through somatic markers rather than summary, keeping knowledge character-bound. Only the “affectionate” trait is slightly under-dramatized; it’s asserted more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s single-minded motive anchors every action; her interior contradiction (grief vs wonder) is embodied, and the final acceptance of sorrow is earned with visible cost—the fossil’s quiet settling.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, embodied determination—her fingertip-touch of “buttons,” the ledger ritual—grounds her interiority; the final flip of the hourglass is a credible renunciation that costs her the certainty of prophecy and the voices of her predecessors.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s wounded-predator stillness, her scar-traced map of betrayal, and the micro-choice to raise her scarred hands rather than flee—each moment crystallizes her internal war between flight and fixation on honor. The contradictory impulses act in-scene and the final stance earns prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elius’s calm, listening stoicism and Linnea’s quiet resolve are embodied in micro-gesture: his ear cocked to the dripping gutter, her fingers prying open book-spine. The shared act of returning the vellum on the water shows irrevocable cost—“the hills sighing in relief”—earning the palimpsest vow its closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s quiet, embodied interiority and tactile micro-choices (hands on clay, shoulder curve of the pot) anchor his arc; the final act of shaping memory rather than hive crystallizes his shift from observer to caretaker with visible cost—he relinquishes the original quest for abstract knowledge to preserve a fragile kindness. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“Aris understood”) that slightly dilutes the embodied epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s interior contradiction between pragmatic usefulness and tender loss is embodied in every tactile choice; the final act of turning the gauge-tooth into a lamp crystallizes her hierarchy of values—growth over nostalgia—at visible emotional cost. No diagnostic speak or stock emotion; sorrow and resolve arrive through soil, moonlight, and the steel’s sliver.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between shielding isolation and the ache of loneliness is dramatized in her daily tracing of the sundial. The final micro-choice—hand on brass—earns the shift from archivist to navigator, with the cost of forever leaving the only home she knows. One slip: “contemporary of a species extinct for ten millennia” is summary, not felt contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictions—architect of eloquence yet haunted by borrowed emotion—are embodied in her wading into the pond; micro-choice of retrieving the letter-lining nest crystallizes her arc. Interiority is precise ("borrowed room"), emotional cost visible in final stance shift from ghost to architect. Deduction for a trace of convenient epiphany in "the method came to her then, fully formed."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s cautious hope is embodied in grease-smudged hands and sleepless eyes; her interior contradiction—yearning to believe yet steeling against betrayal—drives every micro-choice. The final smile carries the cost of exhaustion and the knowledge that the war is only paused, not won.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in micro-choices (measuring steps, cold focus under panic) and culminate in the decisive press of the compass; the cost—her fear transmuted into earned knowledge—lands cleanly. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s prosopagnosia and artistic gift are shown in action, not labels; her interior contradiction—seeing truth through absence—drives every choice. The final empathy surge is embodied in the “raw and aching connection” rather than declared. Only a slight over-articulation of motive (“not justice, not exactly”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s motivation and embodied tension are crisply present, yet her interior contradiction—nervous vs confident—remains more labeled than dramatized under pressure. The renunciation feels earned, but the moment of visible cost comes only in the spectral salute rather than a harder forfeiture she must carry. Minor drift into stock emotional summary (“profound, aching peace”) softens the interior specificity in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her photographer’s eye filters every beat—but the hitchhiker remains a cipher; his absence drives her arc yet never complicates it. The fiddler’s brief presence exerts pressure, but their relationship is more oracle than crucible. Motivation crystallizes cleanly: she turns loss into creation, paying the cost of “never” with a new plate. Flaws and contradictions are implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs inherited criminality) generate on-page micro-choices—folding money into a dart, choosing to dissuade rather than kill. Yet interiority dips into editorial commentary (“paths circle because we insist…”), softening the felt cost of the final renunciation. Still, the Earned Stasis of dropping the strongbox remains credible and rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “shared burdens” felt in the scent of the telegram—and her micro-choice to speak into a dream is embodied and costly. The final beat shows earned stasis: she accepts perpetual solitude as the price of saving the city. Secondary pressure from Alaric is brief but sharp, forcing the star-map revelation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s guarded nature and guilt are viscerally embodied in the frozen confession and obsidian seed beats; the micro-choice to plant rather than destroy the seed crystallizes her earned shift from isolation to integration. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory under pressure. One minor slip: “warlike serenity” is slightly label-like, but the surrounding beats compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s root-bound body and compulsion to “find the intersection of dreams” are embodied in every step—tearing from the soil yet anchored by it. The contradiction of agony/ecstasy is dramatized, not labeled, and her final acceptance of roots as threads carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “purposefully curious” is asserted once without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of her brother’s laughter, the embodied ache of loss—but the “reckless idealist” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single beat shows her risking something new. The final renunciation is earned and costly, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Leo’s contradictory impulses—nostalgia vs. protective fact-armor—are embodied in trembling hands and the micro-choice to open the browser tab. The final renunciation of dollar-value for creative utility is earned by the grille-cloth’s sensory assault and the singer’s note, with visible cost: he forfeits the safety of appraisal for the risk of rebuilding sound.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from arrogant ambition to patient humility is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (tracing cuneiform, planting the seed). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “ash in his mouth” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s dual nature—order vs. lunar flux—is dramatized in the smelting beat, where the ritual fuses the fisherman’s life into a sphere; the cost is the basket’s dissolution and the librarian’s temporary surrender to the older keeper. Interiority is embodied in gear-hum and tidal pull rather than labels. Motivation (“preserve wonder in routine”) is tested by the need to destroy the creel to archive it, creating credible tension. The final micro-choice—placing the sphere—earns a quiet renunciation of physical permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s calcified detachment is embodied in concrete micro-choices (flaw notation, cold efficiency) and cracks only when the shell’s voices pierce him; the shift from certifier to connector is visible in the trembling hand and the deliberate crowning. Elara’s silence functions as pressure, not backdrop. Cost is felt: he forfeits his lifelong identity in a single gesture. Interior contradiction could be sharper mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her finger tracing the taped accordion, the sob that escapes when she reads the graffiti—yet the shift from clinical distance to direct confession is slightly under-motivated; still, the embodied emotion and micro-choice to play the accordion earn the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled dreamer's yearning is embodied and specific; the shift from seeker to guardian is earned through the watch's recursive code. Interiority stays concrete—"my heart a frantic drum"—and the final unspoken gratitude glows on the shelf, paying the cost of acceptance. Minor slip: the confidence man's backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, but it doesn't undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—quiet dream vs imperial duty—drives every micro-choice; the mulberry ache embodies cost before she renounces ownership. Telepathy with plants is more label than lived constraint, slightly blunting flaw-driven mistakes. Final renunciation is earned and costly, yet the absence of on-page secondary pressure keeps it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s quiet dirge, lucid watchfulness, and embodied fatigue at closure all stem from prior causality; the cost—hollowed-out weariness—lands visibly. Interior contradiction is mild and mostly summary rather than in-scene tension, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied (rough hands, muscle strain) and her contradictory impulse—seeking an endpoint while already living the answer—drives the final beat. The micro-choice to retrieve the journal and accept her link in the chain is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost (renunciation of the search). The caretaker lineage is shown, not told, through the hairpin and ledger. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory motives—quieting Kael’s doubt while secretly seeding nuance—are dramatized in her micro-choice to hand over the shard. Kael’s shift from armored certainty to raw astonishment is embodied, not labeled. The cost (loss of the “clear conscience” he paid for) is visible in his steady hand and quiet “I’ll find another way.” Only the brief “ghostwriter for morality” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara is drawn through embodied micro-choices and a slowly crystallizing renunciation that forces an essential, haunting translation; her backwards-aging skin subtly degrades and imprints the stakes in each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s drive—“learn to navigate without moving”—is dramatized when literal stillness exposes the wandering pulse; each beat shows him choosing perception over motion at rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s interior contradiction—yearning for ineffable simplicity while trained to efficiency—drives every beat; the mist-walk embodies this clash viscerally. His final vigil, sustained by a child-level cooling charm, crystallizes the renunciation with visible bodily cost. Minor slip: “finally felt like a true mage” edges toward label-speak, blunting the earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Silas’s yearning is vivid and embodied; the moment he pockets the warm key his gait shifts from routine to compelled, showing motive turning to action. Yet the interior contradiction—solitary keeper vs. inheritor of cosmic covenant—remains asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; we’re told his “truth melted” but see no micro-choice that costs him anything prior to the final plunge. The closing tears feel earned because the color-sound synesthesia is rendered through concrete bodily shock, but the absence of a visible earlier stake or flaw keeps the arc just short of full causality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara's interiority blends doubt and composer-like precision; the shift from passive observer to active composer shows earned growth under pressure, though moments lean slightly analytical rather than raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interior contradiction—duty vs. empathy—is embodied in the trembling hand on the atlas and the final crystallization of the sailor’s bell. The ache evolves from passive to participatory, but the shift is more stated than dramatized; we feel the cost yet see few micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elian’s brittle devotion is embodied in micro-choices—temperature tweaks, drip pacing—each a visible wager against doubt. The shift from naive certainty to “quiet, certain knowledge” is earned drop by drop, with the final toll of the bell as cost. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—guardian of a drowned town who once tried to erase it—drives every beat; the bottle and photographs crystallize memory vs duty. The final renunciation (to bear witness instead of bury) is earned by the trail of objects and costs him the comfort of forgetting. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs intuition—drives every beat; the tearful smile at the end is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost. The “secretly sentimental” trait constrains her final surrender to wonder, not just a label. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “watcher’s burden” is dramatized through her visceral panic and the tactile repair of the buckle. Micro-choices (harvesting the vine, tying the knots) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting she can only watch the pod descend—earns its cost through prior causality. One hairline slip: “remembering through muscle memory” is slightly redundant phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Kaelen’s interiority is sharply embodied—the jar’s stab of memory slices through clinical numbness with “joy so bright it could ignite them.” The contradiction between hollow vessel and torrential emotion plays out in real-time beats; every visceral flash is a micro-choice to stay present. Renunciation becomes reintegration; the cost is the reopened wound of full-spectrum feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation to “safeguard space for innovation” is stated early and drives her final choice, but interiority stays abstract (“a thrill course through her”) rather than embodied contradiction. The orthogonal method is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices; we see the plan, not the struggle. Closure shows earned renunciation—burying the seed—yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—destroying the leaves as both elegy and resurrection—are dramatized in every motion; the final choice (walk into the dust-laden now) earns its sorrow with the wife’s audible sob-giggle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“dimensionally homesick” as a gnawing ache), and her micro-choice to hurl the pendant is earned by the guardian’s revealed plight. The guardian’s shift from growl to chuffing nudge shows credible pressure, but the beast’s interior remains opaque, limiting relationship crucible depth.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—stoic mask vs. resonant sorrow—is embodied in micro-choices (placing the crozier in the crucible, channeling “cold silence”). The final vivification is earned by her iterative failures and carries visible cost: the crozier’s absolute erasure. Trait “stoically sensitive” constrains her early restraint and enables the precise final gesture. Motivation to rupture destiny is dramatized, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulse—clinging to power yet needing silence—drives the decisive discard of the star shard. The cost is felt in the gorge-swallow of a cherished symbol. Minor slip: “profound peace” edges toward label-speak at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leo’s “resiliently positive” trait is embodied in his refusal to see a curse, but interiority stays generic; the final beat (“tempered with a profound understanding”) is told rather than dramatized. Micro-choices under pressure are present—grabbing the radio, turning the hourglass—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the trait drives every beat and earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—rational control vs. awe at irrational eruption—is embodied in the sweat bead and the final stillness. Motivation (“texture of connection”) is dramatized through escalating weaving choices, not stated. The earned renunciation of her model carries visible cost in the snapped thread and fractured loom.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s curiosity is embodied in her whispered awe and tightening grip on the anchor link; Elias’s mentor role is active—he hands her the object and issues the command to become sails. The contradiction between past anchor and future sail is dramatized in a single micro-choice: her closing the fist around cold iron while staring at the unfolded sky. Cost is felt: the terror of “darker sky” and the weight of species vulnerability. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her curiosity is dramatized through the risky use of the hearing-aid and the promise she makes. The final renunciation—accepting the burden of speech instead of mere listening—carries visible cost and is rooted in her established trait. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s claustrophobia and mission to “stand by the unremembered” are stated early and embodied in her hitching breath and trembling hands; the final choice to risk phase-transition extraction is consistent with her stated motive. Interiority is concrete, but the shift from fear to resolve is compressed into a single beat rather than layered. The cost—abandoning the dead to finish the work—lands as Earned Stasis, though the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elias’s mortality paradox and obsessive internal tally anchor every micro-choice; the heartbeat count and shard handling externalize obsession without cliché. The contradiction—needing a past self who failed—drives the final renunciation (picking up a whole cup would be betrayal) with on-page cost: silence is finally accepted instead of denied.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied in copper filigree and precise micro-choices; the contradiction between preservation and the diamond’s curse is dramatized in scene. The final acceptance of dissonance feels earned, with visible cost in the transformed diamond and her exhausted departure. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” is asserted more than shown in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s gallows-humour drive and evolving stance are vivid; contradictory interiority (“cosmic joke” against awe) propels the metamorphosis. Flaws (bitterness) sabotage choices, and the change feels earned. Lacks deeper social stakes or secondary voices, yet stands solid.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet desperation is embodied in micro-choices—shifting bow weight, heartbeat-fed tempo—culminating in the self-sacrificial final note. Contradictory impulses (obedience vs. rebellion) play out in scene, not summary. The cost—orchard’s wild, uncertain future—lands as earned consequence of her music.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s quiet obsession is embodied in the ledger ritual and the bottle exchange; the contradiction between courier duty and moral ledger-keeper is dramatized in the withheld claw. The final micro-choice—closing the ledger “like a beginning”—earns the shift with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet persistence is embodied in every micro-choice—her trembling reach, the low thrum of her unused voice—yet the interior contradiction between her habitual silence and the compulsion to sing is dramatized rather than labeled. The final decision to stay and carve is earned by the causal chain of wrong turn → fragment’s hum → song → charge, with the cost of abandoning her original salvage errand legible in the last tap-tap-tap.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs custodial duty) act simultaneously in the hyperbolic moment. The final renunciation—turning back to help the student—carries visible cost (loss of immediate access to the nexus) and is rooted in prior causality. Minor slip: “sanely eccentric” is label-adjacent, though later embodied in her smiling acceptance of the impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s longing is embodied in her chest and in the salt air; the palette is handled, the light-gathering ritual is dramatized. Her final instinctive act—throwing the sunrise at the lens—grows credibly from prior frustration and the cipher’s pull. The cost is the empty palette and the hushed, answered ache. Interior contradiction (record vs. transform) is present but could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The locksmith’s interiority is spare but embodied; his “singular” motive is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (palming the hair, whispering to ribbon). The final renunciation—placing the ribbon in the drawer—earns a quiet cost, foreclosing further pursuit of the freed idea. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s folklorist identity and memory quest drive every beat; the chronic curiosity is embodied in her dive, photo session, and chart work. Internal contradiction surfaces when nostalgia collides with the need for truth, culminating in the recovered memory that reorders her past. The cost—realizing her mother did not die at sea—lands as a quiet but visible renunciation of long-held grief. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, tool-giving mentor stance is embodied in her tactile handling of shards and tea, and her refusal to pity Kael. The moment she commands “Don’t you retreat from it now” crystallizes her value hierarchy and exacts a cost: she relinquishes solitude to midwife his return. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motives (preserve wonder) and the embedded contradiction—“taking vs giving” in the succor beat—are dramatized in scene. The price she pays—her own memories distilled into light—reverberates in the final image and is precisely tied to earlier exposition about the heirloom seed. One more beat showing the physiological drain earlier would have pushed it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “pale in the starlight,” her needle-work a tactile dialogue with the dead. Motivation (“to ground restless spirits”) is dramatized through the ritual of knot-unraveling and the final suturing of the mask. The only gap is Kael’s functional flatness; he supplies the net but exerts no pressure on Elara’s choices, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her earned renunciation of simple repair in favor of visible mending carries a felt cost that caps the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “heart hammered against her ribs” under pressure. The contradictory impulses (curiosity vs guardianship) act simultaneously in the final beat, and her renunciation to seal the chapel is earned by the preceding discovery. The only minor slip is the slightly abstract “shielded openness” label, but it never overrides the concrete choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s analytic detachment is embodied in her cataloging reflex and the micro-choice to place the globe back; the contradiction between her professional composure and private hollowness is dramatized, not labeled. Mortimer’s archivist persona supplies immediate pressure, but his motives remain external, so relationship-as-crucible is thin. The final renunciation (letting the soul go) is earned by the prior thread-work and carries visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test for contradictory impulses and earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “trapped, silent thing” and “tinkersong wonder” are embodied—but her contradictory impulses (sing vs. silence) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final note she sings lands as earned closure, yet the ghost’s agency overshadows hers, muting her personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kael’s finely-etched interiority—warm inquiry colliding with quiet detachment—drives every beat: the micro-choice to lift the goggles and read the diary is a direct product of his described trait. His compulsion to “seek joy beneath anguish” constrains later tactics like the smiley-face packet. A credible endurance (renouncing formal power yet serving Elias) closes one route at cost. Minor slip: name drift “Elias” vs “new resident”.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interiority is deeply consistent—every beat is filtered through Aris’s emotional perception lens. The shift from panic to cataloging is embodied and specific, not labeled ("gripped…hands steady"). Final renunciation—abandoning being found for memorializing—earns its cost on the glass of the window and the single whispered “Remembered.”

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s face-blindness and sky-mirroring obsession are dramatized through tactile searching, coin-fit, and final renunciation; the contradiction between infinite desire and mortal craft is embodied in the lens failure. Interiority stays concrete, embodied, and character-specific. The earned stasis—watching the sky vanish—costs him the building and the dream simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the dog-ear, kneeling to the hopscotch grid—that escalate to the decisive tuning sequence. The interior contradiction between her sociable isolation and need for recognition is dramatized rather than labeled. Cost is visible: she gains the ship’s gratitude yet remains alone, already turning to the next blank page. A hairline slip: “sociable isolation” is slightly diagnostic shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath plumes, her hands “uncap” the lock, her nostalgia is tactile. Motivation (“rhythm of repair”) is stated early and re-energized by the mirrors and gears, culminating in a visible cost: the moment she repairs is her own fractured self. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One minor slip: “driftwood nostalgia” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied context rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elara’s altruism is dramatized through concrete pressure—she works the bell, wavers, then gives her remaining self to save the grove. Interiority is embodied (phantom shudder, dissipating shimmer) rather than abstract, and the final shift to nebula feels earned by her sustained choices, showing credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “delicate yet steady,” the puppet head’s weight an “anchor”—and her contradictory impulses (duty vs. maternal love) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sing rather than mechanically force the Clock is earned by the puppet’s warmth and her remembered lullaby, with visible cost in her spent slump. Minor slip: “bruised awe” is named rather than fully embodied at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, stubborn ember of motivation is embodied in her offhandedly exact stone-work and the tremor when she places the nut; the contradictory pull between guiding others and freeing herself crystallizes in the final beat. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The cost—loss of her lifelong purpose and identity as caretaker—is felt in the hush that follows the click.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied—his grief crystallizes in the chrysalis and loosens in the river foam. The contradiction between rigid polymer grief and fluid braid insight is dramatized, not told. Micro-choice of releasing the chrysalis crystallizes the shift with visible cost. One notch below 9 because the sister’s absence is off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. empathic involvement—surfaces in the moment he corrects the woman, then yields the floor to her tear. The micro-choice to reveal the “forgiveness not granted” origin carries visible relational cost and crystallizes his own quest. No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in “dust motes dance” and the tear’s warm light. Slight reserve keeps it from 9.0: we glimpse but do not fully feel the price he pays for this discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—tasting ozone and remorse, feeling Elara’s grief as a jolt—but the final absorption of the lord’s memory is slightly under-dramatized; we see the cost (“a new stone in his gut”) more than the moment of choice. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies, yet the boy’s interiority is absent, limiting relationship crucible. Still, contradictory impulses (preserve vs. erase) are embodied in the coral’s weeping, earning the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation to “construct bridges from silos” is embodied in every beat—her empathetic ache for the silent clock, her retrieval of the oak weight, her polyglot song. The interior contradiction (tender urgency vs. methodical precision) is dramatized through micro-choices like singing to gears. The cost—her solitary labor and the irreversible re-synchronization of city rhythms—lands on the page in the final groan of the elevator. Only a slight over-articulation of motive in the opening paragraph keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses are vivid and embodied: terror of synaptic invasion collides with hunger for inherited purpose; the micro-choice to tweak the interface mid-stream crystallizes her hierarchy of values—kinship over safety—with immediate bodily cost. Interiority is specific, rooted in tactile engineering detail rather than self-diagnosis, ensuring the transformation feels earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s prism-mind is dramatized in every beat: slicing time to the second as she waits, parsing geometries in live fungi, translating a casual doodle into the decisive three-beat code. Interior contradiction—detachment vs. single-minded desire—manifests in bodily tension and the final clutch of the pod. Her endurance severs the path to ordinary curiosity when she pays the cost: forever altered by a crystalline burden.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aris’s interiority is embodied and specific; the moment he “let his own breath slow, his heartbeat quiet” crystallizes his empathy as a felt cost. Motivation is singular and intensifies to the final act of strumming the insulator. The earned change—world made resonant—carries visible price in his bodily surrender. No contradictory impulses on page, yet the arc is coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; the worry-stone micro-choice anchors her arc. The exile motive is clear, but the “discover beauty” drive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. The shift from exile to bittersweet home is earned and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from acquisition to connection is dramatized through micro-choices (tuning dial, imagining the craftsman). The final renunciation—silence catalog can wait—carries felt cost. Minor slip: “theatrical sincerity” is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. stillness—is embodied in her frantic soil-tending and later tempered reverence; the micro-choice of idle doodling crystallizes the shift. The final inhalation of decay carries visible cost (acceptance of mortality). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—gripping controls, boots sinking, fingers brushing the arrow—yet interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the arrow) is earned by the memory-shock and the visible greening of moss, so cost is felt. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; motivation is steady rather than conflicted, capping below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is dramatized through micro-choices—mapping wind, pocketing the patch, rerouting tactics—each with visible cost (aching teeth, risk of catatonia). Interiority stays concrete and embodied; no stock labels. The final act of ripping the power coupling is earned by prior causality and forecloses further investigation, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—duty versus necessity of wonder—is embodied in her synesthetic perception and the moment she “pours her entire being” into the final chord, paying the cost of her solitary gift becoming universal. The flaw of believing her art merely decorative is dramatized through her tactile reading of the amber sheet and the cavern’s hush, culminating in earned renunciation of isolation. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; micro-choices under pressure are vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—reverence and fear, detachment and duty—surface in micro-choices (kneeling, brushing dust, raising the flute). The final renunciation of warrior stance for keeper stance is earned and carries visible cost in the sealing note. Minor slip: “harvest insights from failure” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it is quickly grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Aris's contradictory desire to quantify emotion is dramatized through embodied action—ink-stained hands, the press-lever pull—culminating in the final renunciation when he abandons the borrowed mask after the stars' collective grief floods him. The cost is unmistakable: the spent, dark fragment and the ache of authentic feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—boots slipping, knuckles white—but her “jittery courier” trait is stated more than embodied; the pivot from anxiety to keeper is credible yet compressed. The final choice to tend the garden is earned by the pendant’s revelation, but the cost feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara is sharply defined: singlesighted attachment to her theory, embodiment of mystic sensitivity (hearing quartz, perceiving metaphysics), and credible internal contradiction (rage at academics leaks into car). Choices track: anger poured into car→ ice scream; pride humbled by arbor. Quiet renunciation earned—firmly rooted mystic now widened by arbor’s depth.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fatigue etched in “lines of profound weariness”—and her final renunciation (breaking the tapestry) is earned by years of shown sacrifice. The only gap is a slight under-dramatized pivot from despair to the “fragile idea” that unweaving is the answer; it arrives more narrated than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s meekness and quiet determination are embodied in her deliberate forging of rescue gear and her refusal to surrender her mind to the lichen; the final choice to sacrifice the silk effigy instead of herself crystallizes her interior contradiction and costs her the relic, earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is strong, motivation of “professional curiosity sharpens into singular desperation” is dramatized via micro-choices with the shard; contradictory impulses felt in the last jump and in holding the regret alone. Cost shows, but relationship crucible is offscreen; regret remains abstract. Enough earned stasis with Elara’s sigil addition, though the withheld truth itself is simple.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elvan’s reticence and observant nature are embodied in micro-choices—scanning the room, noting the cairn, deciding to relight the lamp. The final acceptance of keeper-hood is earned by the spectral letters’ weight and the visible cost of solitude he embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—dread-tinged thrill vs. prophetic compulsion—are embodied in the laugh he cannot suppress; the crystallized wick and the helmsman’s salvation crystallize his shift from mere keeper to shadow-guide, with the cost of embracing a role he never chose.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the donor-heart beat is a tactile micro-choice that tilts her stance. The dye master’s silence and precise gesture create status pressure, but her explanatory monologue slightly flattens the crucible. The final empathy-bloom is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—his invented unit “7.3 grays of sorrow” is a character-defining tic that later dissolves under pressure. The micro-choice to raise the sextant toward the oaks rather than the sky crystallizes his shift from maintenance to restoration. Cost is felt: he forfeits the directive to deconstruct, embracing an uncharted vocation. One slip: the jump from 7.3 to 7.4 grays is reported rather than dramatized in body or action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s contradictions—borrowed memories vs. active weaving—drive every beat; her quiet renunciation of self to birth communal dawn earns the ending’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“solitude a well-worn cloak”), her empathy drives every beat, and the final renunciation—becoming the library’s quiet truth—carries visible cost. The contradiction between retreat and engagement is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Minor slip: the “mistake” remains abstract, blunting the flaw’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—mourning versus resurrection—drive every beat. The fossilized bread becomes a tactile anchor for her micro-choices, and her final witnessing of the kneeling woman crystallizes her earned stance. Anya’s heuristically gentle trait is shown, not labeled, when she handles the bread dust with reverence. Cost is visible: the irrevocable destruction of the last loaf to make the seed mixture.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied; the Archivist’s shift from cataloguer to seeker of eternal truths is credible. Yet the epiphany—“he had been measuring the wrong thing”—arrives as a narrated summary rather than a dramatized contradiction inside the beat, blunting the cost of change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “frantic drum” heart, the “silent and sure” gait—yet her contradictory impulses (loyalty vs. betrayal) remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the broken fob, Silas’s shame), satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the emotional layering under peak pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s skepticism is embodied through synesthetic tasting and micro-choices (twisting the ring, placing her hand). The final convergence choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of self/place). Interiority is specific, but the anchor’s loneliness is stated more than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s memory-curse is embodied in charcoal-stained fingers and the “hollow chuckle” echo; the interior contradiction—gift as prison—drives every beat. Her final micro-choice (letting memory flood onto the page) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the sorrow becomes fuel. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interiority is specific and unflinching.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interiority—her guilt, yearning, and bodily response to deceit—is richly embodied, and her solitary confession in the Aviary carries visible cost; the moment she names her fear is earned and forecloses her path of complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seasonally mute yet the primary voice of truth—is embodied in every weighted push of brass rings; her silence becomes the engine of the climax, earning both a decision and a visible cost when she forecloses other uses of the fragment’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“metallic sweetness that did little to calm the dissonance”), but the shift from nostalgic caretaker to pilot is compressed into a single beat; the cost is felt yet the contradiction between fear and resolve could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Curator’s interiority is specific—her “trained fingers,” her shift from curiosity to purpose—but the moment of yielding the mailbox feels slightly under-motivated; the “heartbeat” cue is evocative yet abstract. Matteo’s cataract gaze and dry rustle voice are vivid, but he functions more as oracle than pressure. The final silence among neighbors is earned, yet the curator’s personal cost remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied code-breaking and final choice to shoulder the burden are vivid and earned; the grief-encryption motive is dramatized through micro-gesture and dance. Interior contradiction surfaces in her calm resolve versus the lab’s lethal stakes. Cost is felt when the dome ruptures and she flees with the die. Minor slip: “lyrical code breaker” is asserted more than individuated through speech or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s solitary vocation and tactile lantern-work ground his interiority; the ache to recover lost memories is embodied in his careful chipping of salt. His final renunciation—leaving the archive and shouldering the weight of knowing—carries palpable cost. Minor: we never see contradictory impulses in scene; motivation is steady rather than intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“a quiet so profound it felt terrestrially cosmic”), motives are singular and intensify under pressure; the final renunciation—letting the wing go—carries visible cost. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the summoner’s struggle is purely reactive to the prophecy’s assault rather than an internal split.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mrs. Gable’s silence and Elara’s unspoken purpose create a charged crucible; the final gift of the seal crystallizes Elara’s inherited burden with visible cost—her mentor vanishes and the city’s voices become hers to bear.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s shift from pragmatic skeptic to haunted believer is earned through tactile sensory friction—not a bolt-from-the-blue epiphany but a forced surrender to what her hands feel and cannot fix. The contradiction plays out: her lifelong comfort in mending things becomes the very trap as the shell “holds her fast” not with glue but neural resonance. Cost is legible: her dawn exhaustion, the shell now emptied, and her altered sense of self (“so did she”). Minor slip—interior voice drifts toward therapeutic abstraction, e.g., “profound, aching loneliness,” slightly softening rawness. Otherwise interior stakes tighten neatly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—obedience vs. need to understand—are dramatized in the micro-choice of pricking her finger and the later, steady unpeeling of vellum. The interiority is specific to a calligrapher’s eye (pressure of nib, tremor of aging hand). The final act of unlinking is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the false deed curls to nothing. One hairline slip: “forgive the unfinished life” edges toward label-speak before it is embodied in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“reed-blown melancholy,” “vibrating in her teeth”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to sing into the shell is causally earned yet feels slightly under-costed because the merchant’s collapse is external rather than a direct wound to her.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (salvage vs. preserve) surface in the micro-choice to “weave truth carefully.” The final renunciation—closing the window by delivering the globe—earns its cost through prior causality. Minor slip: the daughter’s interiority is reported rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hideo’s quiet endurance and “demure audacity” are embodied in the final gesture: the un-whistled circle of fireflies that wordlessly silences the headman. The contradiction between humility and boldness is dramatized, not labeled, and the cost—his nightly labor now exposed and judged—lands on the page. Interiority stays concrete, tied to the whisk, moss, and insect light. Only the headman’s pressure feels slightly generic, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s drive to unmask lies is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—picking up the diamond, kneeling to dig—each tightening the moral vise. The interior contradiction between exposing truth and destroying hope is kept active in-scene, culminating in a credible renunciation with visible cost: the orchard’s beauty collapses into dead wood. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The flaw that powers him—unyielding skepticism—compounds until it forecloses any other path.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her loneliness, obsession, and ethical reckoning are embodied in chalked walls and gritty dials. The final renunciation (fracturing the broadcast) is earned by her prior investment and despair, carrying visible cost. Minor drift: the prophet remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent, but single-POV focus holds.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The poet’s drive—to translate generations—anchors every choice and survives the micro-epiphany without tidy moralizing; embodiment (“soft, percussive thump of his own heart”) links motive to action. Interiority resists therapy-speak and remains character-bound, though “gleaned redemption” flirts with summary in the final line. Earned Stasis surfaces: he accepts silence forever altered, cost legible in the single clear note that merges with his improvised symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective love vs. tactical calculation—are dramatized in the frantic tuning scene; the final choice to become “part of the song” is earned by prior embodied struggle and carries visible cost (loss of autonomy). Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “logically emotional” is asserted rather than fully embodied in micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—searing impatience versus the need for glacial vigilance—is embodied in every micro-choice: the taut economy of his movements against the humming lodestone, the decision to release the counterweights. His motivation scales visibly with pressure across each beat and culminates in an Earned Stasis that carries real, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—detached investigator vs. aching witness—plays out in embodied micro-choices (touching the lantern, defying protocol). The shift from personal escape to custodial witness is earned by the causal chain of Cora’s memory and the on-page cost of abandoning departmental procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Eli’s guilt and vocational doubt are embodied through tactile micro-choices (handling the heart, winding the key) and culminate in a credible shift from guilt to vocational redefinition. The internal contradiction—minister who doubts his own efficacy—drives every beat. Cost is visible: he purchases the heart, committing to a new practice. Minor slip: Cole remains off-page, so relationship crucible is inferred, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kiv’s curiosity is embodied in tactile tinkering and embodied awe; the arrow-tip micro-choice crystallizes his values under pressure. Interiority stays specific—no stock phrases—and the final smile carries earned cost. Minor slip: “irreverent awe” is asserted rather than dramatized once.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet obsession is embodied in her tactile handling of data and the patch; the final upload is a credible renunciation that costs her career. Interiority is specific—her “sensed absence” is a lived pressure, not a label. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull when she deciphers the coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—shadows recoiling, “still pool” mind—yet the shift from passive observer to active agent is slightly under-cooked; the empathy motive is stated more than embodied in micro-choices. The final renunciation of protocol carries cost, but the emotional toll feels generalized rather than specific to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—seeking death yet clinging to perception—drives every beat; the parasol tip anchors her micro-choice to release rather than hoard. The old woman’s calm crystallizes Elara’s shift from voyeur to participant. Cost is felt when she opens her hand and the ivory vanishes. Minor slip: “euthanasia tourist” is label-speak that never re-enters her embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the vineyard metaphor anchors her contradictory impulses. The final stance—offering Leo a shared vigil rather than a fix—earns its cost through prior parallels. Minor slip: “passionate subtlety” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—her need to capture wisdom versus the cost of binding it forever—governs every micro-move; her kneeling decision is earned by earlier peripheral sensing of the light pattern. The scout’s uncensored presence is a living mirror that refines the resonance, so the moment Elara “wove his innocent perception” the relationship becomes the crucible she needs. Cost is visible when the light dissolves into stone and her spirit is left “weary,” renouncing further contact. Only a touch of label-speak—“sacred charge”—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet, embodied precision (“hands never trembling”) and the moment she chooses to sit and absorb the field reveal interior stakes; the final shift from solitary puzzle-solver to participant in communal healing is earned and carries felt cost—she relinquishes sole authorship of the “masterpiece.”

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s introversion is physicalized through embodied silence and micro-choice; her renunciation of secrecy at climax is earned by prior isolation and cost. Interior contradiction (hope vs despair) is simultaneous, not alternated, shown through her tremor at the crystal’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—yearning to capture the sound yet surrendering to forgetting—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, pressing ear to metal). The final renunciation is earned: he accepts the cycle of loss with a tear, foreclosing any hope of permanent possession. Interiority is specific and non-diagnostic; the “tidal longing” is shown through action, not label. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her quiet obsession with “cosmic beauty” and the “luminous ache” of preservation drives every micro-choice. The contradiction between her desire for permanence and the necessity of embracing impermanence (the leaf’s ephemeral sound) is dramatized in the final beat. The cost—accepting a fleeting silence as the only anchor—lands with felt weight. Minor slip: “changelessly constant” is repeated as label rather than embodied trait.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s serene-therapist temperament and micro-choices (tone bar on vinyl shard, steady breathing sync) create consistent interior contradiction—the urge to save versus hospice realism. Final reunification choice feels earned, but the ‘decisively kind’ label reads slightly thematic rather than embodied, nudging the score down a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“quietly deliberate pace,” “breath held”), but the internal contradiction—rational scholar vs. childlike wonder—never collides in-scene; the automaton’s awakening is driven more by Elara’s monologue than by a visible micro-choice that costs her something. The “why” she offers is heartfelt yet abstract, so the final insight feels gifted rather than earned through her flaw. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the arc lands in credible renunciation (she accepts the moment, not a place).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. belief, maternal need vs. ethical recognition—are dramatized in the garden: she first reaches to take her son, then chooses to heal the Fae and return the tooth. The embodied shift from “cleft certainty” to “wiser knowing” is earned through tactile micro-choices (bone-setting, cord untying) that carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the tactile polishing of the sea glass crystallizes her quiet resolve. The internal conflict—keep the light for herself or offer it—drives every micro-choice and lands with a felt cost when she commits to becoming a lens. Minor: the grandmother memory is vivid but slightly generic, nudging the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s interiority is embodied and specific; her tactile tending of moss and the amber pendant anchor her need to reclaim agency after public exposure. The quiet proffer of moss crystallizes her shift from isolation to shared vulnerability, with the cost of exposure still palpable. Leo’s arrival and acceptance form a credible crucible that alters both characters’ stance. Only minor: Leo’s voice is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elias’s interior contradiction—career fabulist now stripped of comforting lies—is embodied in the tactile worry of the shell and the shame of having “polished her raw truth into a cheap, pretty line.” The final choice to cast the shell away is earned by prior guilt and memory, carrying visible cost. However, the story leans on reflective summary more than simultaneous contradictory impulse in scene, slightly blunting the live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s quiet, persistent hum of motive is palpable, and her embodied trembling at moonrise shows interior stakes. Yet the interiority stays slightly generic—no contradictory impulse undercuts her resolve, so the arc feels single-note. The final tears register, but the cost is more observed than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hour-long stillness with outstretched arm is a lived contradiction of her flash-paper vocation. Motivation (preservation vs combustion) is dramatized through micro-choices: selecting twigs, uncorking starlight, pressing the flash-paper. The final renunciation of fire for permanence carries visible cost in the fused plate. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise—her “peripherally focused” trait is dramatized through sonic mapping and micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (“store wonder”) is embodied in every beat, culminating in the earned smile and pack-stowage that forecloses further tinkering. The only gap is a near-perfect competence that softens struggle; a single gear-slip or doubt would have deepened flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her dread is embodied in the “cold dread, colder than the grotto’s air.” The shift from self-referential weaving to cosmic orientation is a credible, costly renunciation of her old stance. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she was boundary-lessly trapped”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—callus on gouge handle, scent of ash—but the “lesson” motivation is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse tests her resolve on the page. The carving’s completion is earned, yet the cost is emotional summary rather than a visible forfeiture. Still, her grief-breathing metaphor and micro-choices under kettle-time pressure keep her credibly flawed and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to sever the past yet clutching its blueprint—play out in embodied micro-choices (gripping the camera, stepping off the platform). The ghost’s “I am your blueprint” crystallizes her internal conflict and forces a stance shift with visible cost: she must shoulder the unexposed film. Minor slip: “regret softened” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied turn outweighs it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “stoic wonder” and “profound focus” are shown through tactile micro-choices (cleaning lenses, aligning pipes). The contradiction between nostalgia and functional purpose is dramatized, not stated. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: the terminal’s new life is hers alone, no crowds return. Minor: the “equations of hope” phrase edges toward label-speak but is quickly grounded in physical work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—safety of transcription vs. dormant creator—drives every micro-choice; the moment she touches the gear embodies cost and re-opens a foreclosed path. Reflection stays anchored in present sensory cues and alters tactics. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Closure choice is earned and carries visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her “pull in her bones” toward dissonance feels lived-in. The contradiction between her desire for truth and the sorrow she uncovers is dramatized through the tactile handling of the sundial and the micro-choice to read the notes. The final Earned Stasis—accepting the melancholy truth without ornamentation—carries visible emotional cost. Minor: the lover’s death is only summarized, not embodied, so the clockmaker’s grief remains second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her patience is dramatized in the slow unfurling of the knot and the warming fulgurite. The shift from collector to initiate is earned and carries felt cost in the final image. Amos’s quiet guardianship adds relational pressure without crowding the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interior contradiction flickers once (projecting presence vs documenting endings) but does not press beyond summary. Isolde’s grief is embodied, but the boy’s craftsman joy arrives fully formed from the thread rather than through prior causal stakes. The renunciation – keeping loss woven in – is emotionally plausible yet only thinly foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s isolation, obsessive hypothesizing, and embodied trembling under pressure are vivid; the final kneel and tear-streaked cheeks crystallize his arc. Interior contradiction—hope vs. dread—drives every micro-choice. Cost is legible: the ghost-bird’s departure confirms both success and irretrievable loss. Minor slip: “bedraggled” is stated more than dramatized early on.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory inheritance—fire as both destroyer and savior—drives every micro-choice; the embodied shame and resolve are palpable. The final tying of the coin is a credible renunciation of her father’s legacy with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the “gracefully alert” label drifts toward abstraction, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her wary hand hovering over the box and the “war with hope” moment; her interior contradiction is dramatized rather than labeled. The micro-choice to press palms against the lid rather than pry with force crystallizes her values hierarchy and costs her prior detachment. One slip: “quiet, persistent ache” is slightly diagnostic label-speak, not fully embodied. Otherwise motivation, flaw, and cost align to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is luminous and specific—her shift from passive archivist to active seeker is embodied in the gear’s weight and the nebula’s magnetic threading. The contradiction between preservation and intervention is dramatized, not stated. Cost is felt when she accepts the endless labor of re-running the simulation. Minor slip: “deep melancholy settled” is label-speak amid otherwise embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from dutiful craft to spiritual scribe is earned through tactile micro-choices with the ribbon and the vision. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of motive (“she needed to discover…”) that edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. absolution—drives every beat; the rake-handle notches embody her guilt and the final renunciation is earned. Embodied emotion (“bent her shoulders,” “cold, sharp-toothed surf”) is specific and non-generic. The only cap is that the father backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping her from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s quiet, stubborn happiness and her embodied tending of graves anchor her interiority; the final realization that her tools are for resurrection crystallizes a credible shift in motive with visible cost—she must now act on the knowledge. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her finger on the wall, the ache in her hand—yet the “ignorance cartographer” label is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve is earned, but the contradiction between fear and duty could be sharper in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “singular and strange” motivation to teach dust to speak is embodied in nightly micro-choices (cloaking the window, sifting dust). The contradiction between her public obedience and private rebellion is shown, not told. The final shift from “teacher” to “conduit” is earned by her listening action and carries felt cost: she now bears the burden of perpetual translation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—preservation vs. impermanence—are embodied in the micro-choice to release the ash rather than seal it. Her interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with filial grief; the final smile carries visible cost of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silas’s contradictory impulses—truth vs. social cohesion—are dramatized in the final beats when he reframes the slate’s revelation as a navigational lesson; the cost is the deliberate suppression of the uglier truth, felt in the bite of the cog. Elara’s shift from fear to curiosity is credible and status-driven. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. The only slip is a touch of convenient didactic clarity in the closing dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Anya’s motivation to “braid voices” is dramatized through the zither demonstration; her expectant resignation is embodied in the way she pushes the instrument toward Leo. Leo’s micro-choice—“How?”—is a credible crack in armor earned by the preceding sensory lesson. Both characters remain specific individuals rather than types, and the cost (department closure, unlearning hatred) is felt. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” is stated rather than fully shown in body language.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s layered motivation (“to prove decay could birth wonder”) anchors every on-page choice, yet the interiority drifts into lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction during pruning. “Quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions” lands thematically but is asserted, not dramatized within Elara’s body; the final cost is poetically stated more than visibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s involuntary candor is embodied in the throat-tightening compulsion and the “tasting like ash” line; her micro-choice to open the box under pressure crystallizes her value hierarchy. The technician remains a functional sounding board rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Interior contradiction is present but resolves a touch too smoothly into cooperative awe.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—detached scholar vs. compelled caretaker emerges late but is embodied by her fingers touching the silence-stone. Motivation turns from curiosity to self-offering, but her flaws stay abstract; no moment where the choice stings. Passes micro-choice test but misses stronger cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Statue’s shift from passive certainty to active guardianship is embodied and earned; its micro-choice to point at the column crystallizes the arc. The historian’s incisively kind motivation is dramatized through her gentle excavation rather than conquest. Interiority is concrete, telepathy filtered through sensory stone. Only the absence of visible cost on the human caps it at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—grim acceptance vs. the need to garden the staircase—are embodied in her chalk equations and the dice she rolls; the final micro-choice to trust the chipped die earns the rupture and her shift from solver to gardener, with the cost of abandoning the past.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s insomnia and methodical hope are embodied in tactile micro-choices (climbing iron stairs, guiding visions). The final renunciation—realizing she only needed to give light, not prove anything—earns rest with visible cost: her vigil ends, canvas complete. Interior contradiction (hope vs. exhaustion) stays active in scene. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s museum-guide identity grounds every micro-choice (from archival gaze to teaching lens-use) and her endurance of “rosewater dread” is embodied, not abstract—every beat of the story is filtered through her sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“bleak exhilaration, sharp and lonely as a shard of glass”—but the final beat withholds a visible cost; the triumph feels unchallenged, so the renunciation/change is only partially earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-preservation—surface in the moment she chooses to walk deeper rather than flee, but interiority sometimes drifts into abstract labels (“repulsive allure”) instead of embodied contradiction. The clasp as an extension of her body and history is vivid, and her final micro-choice to weaponize boredom is earned by prior beats. Yet the whispering advisor remains off-stage, so relationship crucible and status pressure are absent, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kai’s trait of turning obstacles into instruments is embodied in every action; the restless interiority is palpable, and the final pluck of the lemon carries visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between welcoming the storm and fearing its silence—shown, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing grooves, turning the whistle, playing the fracture-song—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The shift from academic curiosity to communal guide is earned through the whistle’s discovery and the gate’s precise opening, with the cost of leaving isolation legible in the final glance back. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding label-speak. Only the absence of on-page relationships prevents the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aris’s emotionally rational stance is embodied in the cool, analytical way he “adjusts the strap of his satchel” while feeling the chill of the task; his contradictory impulse—protecting the artifact he once helped mythologize—drives the climax. The micro-choice to persuade rather than overpower Elara crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him the moral simplicity of righteous anger. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final beat of closing the case without ceremony is a credible renunciation of violent truth-telling.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s contradictory impulses—stoic restraint vs. elegiac need—are embodied in the numb-fingered repair ritual and the locket’s visceral rupture. The final note-sealing choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the sob, the soaked clothes). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the “archeologist of abandoned dreams” label flirts with abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—duty to truth vs. duty to city—are dramatized in the stamp-flip beat. The final renunciation carries visible cost: she forfeits immediate justice to guard deeper truth. One hairline slip: “tranquilly perceptive” edges toward label-speak once.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile craft and micro-choices (folding cranes, polishing amber, releasing dream). The final renunciation—letting the luminous crane ascend—earns its cost through prior causal chain; sorrow visibly lifts yet love remains. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. One slip: “her spirit descend while ascending” edges toward abstraction, but the embodied action of release keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s survivor guilt and milky eye are embodied in concrete micro-choices (geode to forehead, zero-g push-off). The final “how to drink” stance crystallizes her arc with visible cost: joy is dead, only cold proof remains. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “mathematical fluke” edges toward label-speak mid-peak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “perpetually surprised” ocular implants externalize her isolation—but the pilgrim remains a cipher, diluting relational crucible pressure. Motivation is clear yet abstract: “frequency of belonging” never sharpens into a concrete want that costs her something tangible until the final merge. The earned change (she “was not the same”) is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s guilt is embodied in tactile ritual (driftwood, watch hand) and drives the final renunciation; the contradictory impulse to heal vs. silence is dramatized in the tremor of her hands. Motivation is clear and intensifies to the climactic lie. Minor slip: “manufactures false memories” is stated more than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her thumb on the brass pull, her refusal to step between the spitting boy and the commander—yet her “uncommonly thoughtful” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The drawer-pull micro-choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values and visibly costs the commander his retaliatory impulse, earning the Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is embodied and selective—e.g., “cold, brass object… worn smooth… a lifetime of anxious thumbs.”  Internal contradiction shows: desire to leave vs. longing to locate self.  Final “alignment” arrives not from skill but from attention, an earned renunciation that forecloses “chartable” life.  Compass-needle/wrist tremor finally ties flaw to choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior conflict—erase vs. recreate self—is visceral (body as blank slate feels like erasure). Her micro-choice not to sell the ball but to plant it with the grandson crystallizes her arc and shows hierarchy of values (“connection over survival”). Only slip: late exposition of grandson feels tacked-on rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Elara’s contradictory grief—trying to resurrect vs. accepting transformation—drives every tactical beat. Embodied emotion (hand passing through Fenrir’s shoulder) yields credible Earned Stasis, visible cost in final merging.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—inked constellations, the ache of new fatherhood, the micro-choice to prick his finger and “unfasten” time. Contradictory impulses (desire to reclaim vs. acceptance of loss) coexist in scene, culminating in Earned Stasis: he descends ready to be present. The flaw of overreach is dramatized, not labeled. Only the spectral woman’s dialogue drifts toward abstraction, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—her refusal to fight the grief, her tactile mending, the moment she lifts the jade tear. Interior contradiction surfaces when the ship’s gravity of sorrow threatens to paralyze her, yet she converts that weight into buoyant action. The final smile carries visible cost: she has renounced any future of human return, sealing the species’ extinction into her own act of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradictory impulses—need to give vs. recognition of emptiness—play out in the micro-choice of opening the jar. The final renunciation of her old identity is earned by the causal chain of “accidental prophecies” and carries visible cost (poverty, relinquished agency). Minor slip: the phrase “she finally understood” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kael’s interiority is precise—his calm inventiveness under blackout pressure is embodied in micro-choices (emptying quills, angling bronze). Motivation (silent revolution against Luminary greed) is rooted early and drives every beat; the final “winking hush” crystallizes cost without tidy redemption. One slip: the scribe’s cameo is too brief to register as relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaelen’s interior contradiction—cursed foresight yet driven by forgotten promise—grounds every beat; the final alignment costs him his identity as “herder,” a visible renunciation. Embodied emotion (“his fingers arranging…”) and micro-choices (spiral placement, reaching with “entirety of his being”) keep interiority concrete. Flaw (compulsive pattern-seeking) complicates tactics and is confronted in the earned stasis. Only the amnesic promise edges toward convenient amnesia, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—compliance vs. witness—drives every beat; the embodied shift from archivist to witness is earned by the ticking timer and the poem’s cost. Micro-choice of reading aloud to the storm crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—duel vs. alliance—are dramatized in her micro-choice to step onto unpainted stone; the mechanical arm’s click embodies cost. Kaelen’s shift from adversary to partner is credible because the needle-card cipher forces it. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic. The final hand-clasp forecloses further combat with visible, sun-warmed cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s shifting identities are woven into each action: he cannot ascend the sealed stairs without his archivist calm, nor open the contraband cache without fear—the contradiction cracks him open, justifying his final renunciation of solitude. Motives stay rooted and intensify under pressure, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—prying the key, syncing the clock to tidal rhythm—each action exposing the cost of her refusal to let go. The contradiction between her steely resolve and the ache of loss is dramatized, not labeled. The final echo of her husband lands as earned renunciation: she accepts the single encore, paying with the night’s inevitable close.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her whimsical empiricism manifests in tactile tests of rainbow viscosity and stone melodies. The contradiction between playful curiosity and grave duty drives every beat, culminating in the luminous doubt that fuels the final act. Micro-choices (digging, cradling the seed, pouring memory) align with motive and foreclose retreat. The earned cost—her soaked body beneath an unquenchable light—crystallizes her arc without tidy moral resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the cerulean regret pulses in her body rather than as label. Kaito remains a cipher—his dialogue functions as oracle, not character—so relationship crucible is thin. The final renunciation (not finishing the lace) carries visible cost and is earned by the tactile revelation. Flaw: Kaito’s passivity never complicates Elara’s path; he is pure facilitator.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (examining dust vs. cataloging damage) and embodied emotion ("breath catching"), but neutron-star expertise isn't leveraged beyond initial setup, slightly weakening causality for the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation for intergenerational support drives all action; embodied contradiction in "solemn grace" masking desperate scanning eyes shows interiority under pressure without diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong embodied motivation ("aching motivation" to find unused love) and micro-choices under pressure (breath control guiding light), but transformation lacks contradictory impulses; past-life integration feels too seamless without visible struggle in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interior contradiction evident in designer's spatial mind versus temporal paralysis, but "retrocognitively trapped" label breaks embodied emotion. Micro-choices limited by physical stasis weaken agency under pressure despite strong motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines in "raw, circular impressions" versus "staggering grace," but motivation ("plant resilience") edges toward abstraction without deeper conflict. Final self-imprisonment earns closure through visible cost of freedom for seed protection.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in synesthetic perception versus scientific rigour; micro-choices navigating shipwrecks reveal her obsession's cost. No second character present, so relationship bullets irrelevant. Final endurance (carrying the sound) earns closure with tears and fading vision.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's interior contradiction (thief vs preserver) drives her pivotal choice; embodied emotion in "cold clarity" realization avoids therapy-speak; violinist/woman remain symbolic but closure earns endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "weighty lightness" and micro-choice of placing the bookmark on the console, but "cold anger" lacks prior embodied evidence before the pivotal realization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Contradictory impulses (fear vs purpose) act simultaneously during decryption; final choice to face Marcus with vulnerable tokens earns theme through prior causality. No diagnostic labels—embodied terror ("hands shook") layers with frantic focus. Minor abstraction in "trembling certainty" slightly dilutes peak interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction (obsession vs. exhaustion) drives closure; embodied cost in "muscle burned/eyes stung" makes renunciation credible. Slight abstraction in "captured infinity" prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels via robotic specificity ("executable file," "tactile sensors logged paradox") but lacks embodied contradiction; "I wonder" moment earns motivation yet emotional layering remains constrained by POV limitations. Final choice crystallizes flawlessly through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (oblivious guilt vs conscious effort) embodied through ticket doodles and lens use; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values when placing ticket on Leo's knee without words. Brother's thawing reaction lacks sufficient prior friction to fully earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses (accepting low luck-score while actively mending through ritual) drive her endurance. Final choice to polish despite official’s warning earns closure through visible cost: his shattered worldview. Strength lies in embodied motivation ("gardens know their gardeners") made visceral via marble ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority concrete through mechanic's lens ("calloused hands," "worn smooth lever"), contradictory impulses (practical engineer vs. abstract theorist) culminate in earned renunciation of linear time. Slight underdevelopment of pre-climax tension prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority shines through embodied choices (holding cello above water, breath catching at harmonic response), but contradictory impulses beyond the central musical tension remain underdeveloped. Micro-choices like playing staccato notes to test the water’s reply credibly reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interior contradiction (writer vs conductor) shown through micro-choices, but "familiar enigma" abstraction lacks embodied cost during crisis; final choice's cost ("old life receding") feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses (protecting artist vs. community expectations) crystallize in the climax with visible cost ("weight of trust"), though "boldly sympathetic" trait leans toward label over embodied demonstration in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation (combating forgetting through fragments) and exile backstory create embodied contradiction; micro-choice to reframe the ship’s record shows hierarchy of values with visible cost ("silence of its trumpet had been her freedom"). Lacks higher-stakes pressure testing her "hearten" drive.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction shines (mapper vs. chaotic life), and the micro-choice of speaking her fear reveals value hierarchy with visible cost.

Minor deduction for no inevitable mistake altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority rooted in scientific precision ("silicate," "titanium tweezers") and embodied melancholy ("sweet sadness," muscles aching from cold) creates authentic contradiction between duty and grief. Final endurance earns visible cost without tidy resolution.

Only minor deduction for the "archaeologist of intention" line bordering on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s interiority shows contradictory impulses (preserving images vs. embracing silence) through embodied "luminous ache," but "beautiful pain" risks label-like abstraction in peak crisis without deeper somatic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s embodied professionalism shines through micro-choices (tone bar precision), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her flawless execution feels slightly idealized without visible struggle against grief or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara's motivation (childhood obsession intensified by reality fraying) and micro-choice to shift from data to sensory description feel earned, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are embodied yet insufficiently layered with flaws during pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s "forgiving skepticism" drives contradictory impulses—relief for her son clashing with recognition of the Fae’s grief—culminating in the earned, costly tooth exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (solitude vs sharing) manifests in concrete micro-choices like polishing rhythm and angling glass, but emotional progression lacks visible irrationality; solitude's cost remains abstract despite strong embodied polishing details.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior contradiction shines in Lyra’s "jolt of vulnerability" versus her "protected space held firm," with embodied micro-choices like cupping moss as invitation. Slight abstraction in "graft new meaning" prevents 9.0 despite strong flaw integration.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction ("writer of lies" vs. unable to fabricate comfort) embodied through shell-worrying and theft shame; final choice to "live quiet hopes" earned by bedside memory's command with visible cost in "fragile, and true." No diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior causality. No visible cost to character beyond situational resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motivation for preserving heartbeats is clear and embodied through ritual actions, but lacks contradictory impulses during the climax—Elara's unwavering focus misses the required internal tension. The fossilized apple placement shows character-specific choice, yet no visible struggle between urgency and precision undermines the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shows contradictory impulses (contemplative urgency) via micro-choices like timing reflection studies; embodied emotion through tactile repair work avoids therapy-speak. Lacks deeper tension about using wonder now versus storing it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-choices under pressure (turning blindly) reveal hierarchy of values; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak. "Boundary-lessly trapped" trait drives collapse but slightly abstract in early exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "not lonely, but full of conversation needing no words," with embodied emotion through wood grain and callus memories.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "eroded ambitions" vs. resolute scavenger identity; embodied regret transforms into "dull, useful tool" with cost. "Chronologically confused" trait remains label-only, not constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's "functionally creative" trait drives tangible choices (sextant as calibrator), but emotional embodiment during climax lacks physical sensation—steam's heat on skin would heighten cost. Micro-choices reveal hierarchy (prioritizing conduit alignment over fatigue), yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped beyond professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interiority avoids labels: "ache in her bones" embodies silence's cost; contradictory impulses (fear/desire) act simultaneously when she touches the bear. Final choice earned through scribe's precision aligning with creator's intent, with visible cost in "poignant ache for the girl she had been."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction in "serene upheaval" shows simultaneous calm/restructuring; embodied emotion via "fingers brushed smooth metallic" and "breath catching"; micro-choices in salvage technique reveal values. Slight underdevelopment of contradictory impulses pre-revelation holds score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s transformation from collector to initiate feels earned through embodied micro-choices (thumb tracing fulgurite, ignoring cold), but Amos lacks secondary pressure; his late reveal as guardian diminishes relationship-as-crucible impact despite strong interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (observer vs participant) act simultaneously when the thread shifts her craft; Isolde's embodied grief avoids therapy-speak as she traces the carpet's ocean. Final choice to write of "woven integration" earns closure through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s skepticism/hope contradiction drives action; "sidereal patience" embodies her micro-choices under pressure. Final renunciation of skepticism earns closure through prior breadcrumb causality. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: altering course for the gear then weaving data shows shifting values. Final renunciation of passive archiving earns closure with palpable cost ("heavy weight in her being"), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Slight underdevelopment of "sentimentalist" motivation pre-discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction in "thoughtful nature" vs ignited motivation; embodied emotion through chisel/ribbon; micro-choice to follow spectral nudge shows hierarchy of values. Final scribe realization earns closure without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s dual life (keeper of time/secrets), but the "mistake no one remembered" lacks concrete causality, slightly weakening the climax’s motivation despite embodied emotions like "cold, sharp-toothed surf" clarifying her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—her transition from grief to hope feels seamless without embodied struggle in the decoding process.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "doubt seeped" vs. "would not let fear freeze her hand," with embodied cost in aching hand and hand hovering over parchment. Micro-choice to write despite heresy risk earns closure, though "pure and sharp motivation" borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) manifest physically in brush control and embodied grief; the final witnessing choice is earned through her process. No second character limits relationship dynamics but single-POV baseline is fully met with micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Leo's armor cracking via "How?" earns change through embodied contradiction (defiance vs whisper), but "fear. The anger." borders on label-only emotion without sufficient physical manifestation in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's contradictory impulses—gentle rebellion vs. necessary violence—drive pruning choices; "compassionate editing" crystallizes earned wisdom with felt cost in "screaming chaos" memory wave.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority shines through embodied contradiction (clutching box while compelled to speak truth), but the technician lacks depth beyond functional skepticism; "preserve wonder" motivation drives her choice credibly, though micro-choices during crisis feel slightly streamlined.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority vividly embodied ("fingers touched it, the ambient sounds vanished") but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice earned yet no meaningful trade-off shown during ritual participation shift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels through concrete embodiment ("thumb tracing the jagged scar") and contradictory impulses (grim optimism vs mathematical control). Final choice earned by prior causality, but "balancedly daring" phrasing slightly overused without sufficient variation in expression during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (exhaustion vs methodical hope) drives choices; embodied emotions layer realistically as strangers recognize ancestral kindnesses with breath-hitched vulnerability. Final rest earned through vigilance, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara's motivation is vivid but protagonist lacks interior contradiction; "rosewater dread" tells rather than embodies emotion. Micro-choices under pressure absent during hive retrieval climax.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    Contradictory impulses (stoic armor vs grief) manifest concretely in the locket breakdown; micro-choice to write "She hummed" over concerts reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("sob escaping him").

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interior contradiction shines in clumsy paper folding vs. skilled glasswork, embodying grief's duality. Micro-choice to "transform not fold" compels higher stakes through tangible craft.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction (observer vs seeker) drives micro-choices like abandoning the console, but the epiphany "a billion voices singing" risks abstract therapy-speak, slightly undercutting embodied emotion at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interior contradiction ("merrily melancholic") manifests in embodied micro-choices: weak then rhythmic strokes, grim smile while chasing poles. Final alignment earned through osprey observation, not epiphany—clenched fist relaxing shows cost without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority excels with embodied contradictions ("jaded wonder curdled into painful clarity"), but the erased-record backstory lacks active constraint on choices.

No diagnostic labels mar the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction shines in "fractured mirror" precognition showing simultaneous hope/despair; micro-choice of reaching "with entirety of being" reveals value hierarchy shift. Epiphany slightly over-articulated but redeemed by embodied cost of world's "shudder" and dissolving dust.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motivation rooted in "cartography of scars" manifests through embodied choices (reading brother's poem, voice woven into storm). Contradictory impulses (compliance vs witness) crystallize in the "rarefy" realization. Lacks one visceral physical detail during peak stress to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's mechanical arm embodies internal conflict through tactile detail ("clicked, calculating"), but her epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; the "how to build" realization reads as tidy resolution rather than earned struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara's embodied grief ("pull deep within her chest") and contradictory impulses (seeking color while fixated on horizon) feel authentic; Kaito slightly functional as catalyst but earns weight through the compass revelation that transforms her stance with visceral cost.
