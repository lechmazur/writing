    The glass artist POV is consistent and embodied through craft metaphors ("breath settle into the valley's long exhale," "steady as cooling glass"). Interior texture remains stable but the protagonist's agency is muted—most of the story is retrospective reconstruction rather than live decision-making under pressure. The final choice to create and distribute "Scorched Testament" is told summarily rather than dramatized with competing impulses. Micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent; the narrator processes the discovery smoothly without visible internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior life is vivid and embodied, driven by concrete sensory memory ("blue-lipped," "smelling of salt") and shaped by trauma that generates a credible vow. Sura's presence adds relational pressure through gesture and shared work, though her interior remains opaque by design. The final beat—"is this enough music to keep you afloat"—earns its weight through the ferry backstory and the sustained project, with the narrator's affirmative answer rooted in lived particulars. Minor: the fisherman's cameo feels slightly ornamental, but his gift and silent acknowledgment deepen the narrator's arc without inflating the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The undertaker's interiority is vivid and embodied throughout—grief runs "the way water wears a channel," and the lens taps teeth with Morse. The protagonist's trait "inadvertently stubborn" is shown through choices (hiring the skiff, wedging into the seam) with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between wanting to give rest and being compelled by the tapping signals. Minor deduction: the peak choice to occupy the impossible space feels more lyric than grounded in prior micro-choices; the act is declared rather than built through escalating agency.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's characterization shows consistent traits (gently persistent, careful) and her decisions shape the story's tactics. Internal contradiction appears in the Noor/Farid tension but not within Mara herself. The collective "we" POV diffuses individual stakes and micro-choices; Mara's motivations are told more than tested under pressure. The final choice—continuing the system—feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible renunciation or forfeiture with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's spiritual curiosity and camera obscura practice are established, but interior experience remains abstract and metaphorical rather than embodied. The protagonist's choices—bringing the tear, stitching bellows to ribs, breathing to open the aperture—are present but lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the arc reads as a ritual unfolding rather than a dramatized struggle. The "woman carrying kwan yin's tear" from memory lacks agency or friction; she "teaches" and "hands" but does not pressure the protagonist's present choices with competing costs. Emotional progression is poetic but lacks the messy irrationality or self-deception that would anchor it in felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is coherent (discovering "the texture of time") and drives the choice to pry the halo fragment free and eventually relinquish it. Interiority is often concrete ("I told myself to quit touching the past") and the final renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost (photographs bleach to blankness, the shard disintegrates). However, the character's internal contradiction—building the maze to touch duration "without breaking it" yet also being "retrocognitively trapped"—could be more embodied in micro-choices during peak beats rather than retrospectively narrated. The emotional arc from pretense ("pretending not to remember") to acceptance reads as earned, though some reflection edges toward label-speak ("touch the grain of duration").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is highly specific and embodied ("patiently strategic," chaining herself to the bench leg), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—honoring her grandmother's legacy while defying the Collectors' archival impulse. Micro-choices like wedging the arrow through the hasp and offering packets to the Collectors reveal a hierarchy of values. The grandmother's backstory anchors present action concretely and tilts the stance at closure, though some reflection edges close to the 20% threshold without fully crossing into pattern-taught mode.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's synesthetic trait and professional identity are well-established, and the pursuit of the "fracture-note" provides clear internal motivation. The father's revelation near the end creates a charged moment, though the emotional contradiction could be sharper—the protagonist's reaction to the father's admission stays somewhat muted. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the thinning was a frequency"), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final choice to "set the orchard to grow" feels more symbolic than earned by a visible renunciation or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and distinct, but agency at the ending is muddied—the "stay" decision belongs to the future self, not the protagonist whose jar-opening is the visible act. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("I steal nothing except light from time") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The florist and the man provide pressure, but the protagonist's choice to "simply stay" and release moonbeams reads passive, a gesture rather than a foreclosure with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; much is told through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glassblower's interiority is present and textured through specifics like holding the bookmark with her teeth and narrating to empty chairs, and her reflective mode is anchored to present actions. However, the protagonist remains contemplative rather than pressured by contradiction; the choice to "craft safe zones for inquiry" unfolds as a patient demonstration rather than a dilemma that forces competing goods or visible sacrifice on the page. The final choice—"I will count breaths until inquiry simply feels like home"—reads as gentle arrival rather than a renunciation or trade-off, so Q1 caps below high-band entry despite strong voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's phobia-ridden stunt double identity is embodied through specific physical memory ("body knows fire, heights, water, and impact"), and the trembling hands against forward motion shows contradictory impulses in action. The interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("breath keeps arguing with itself," "old fear climb my spine like a hot ladder"). However, the final confrontation relies on convenience choreography (chalked safe tiles, rotten boards beneath Kellan) that reads more like screenplay blocking than earned character choice, and the pivot from victim to agent lacks micro-choices that show the cost of crossing that threshold in real time. The seashell functions more as talisman than a dramatized anchor for decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scribe's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through craft obsession and the father's pier memory. The oracle arrives as a distinct voice with tactile details (grains in braids, foam-tasted stick), and their interaction generates genuine pressure. The scribe's arc—from "a map needs edges" to naming pauses as harbors—feels earned through on-page negotiation with the oracle's pedagogy. Minor slip: the commander and fort men remain functional props without individuated pressure, and the ending's collective gentleness ("men listened… began to tie their gear with gentler fingers") gestures at change without showing a forfeited path or visible cost in the scribe's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    JN-3's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied perception ("dots tingled like salt under paint") and a clear hierarchy of values around patient observation. The motivation—to find where thoughts originate—shapes micro-choices across loops (marking chalk, daring to bow the violin) with visible cost (risking reprimand, slowing quotas). The final realization ("they come from contact and care") is earned through accumulated sensory experience rather than assertion. Minor: the robot's composure is asserted more than it constrains action, and the arc leans heavily on reflection, though each loop includes tactile decision points.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voiced ("my ledger felt heavier than its paper"), and the choice to expose both Rell and self is motivated by visible contradiction between watching records bend and fearing to speak. Internal conflict appears in simultaneous impulses: "If I revealed this, I would reveal myself, and perhaps be broken, but perhaps be freed." The final gesture—setting the lens beside Rell and pointing to their own name—embodies agency with cost, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined by the lyric premise rather than fought for under unpredictable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine dresser's motivations are clear and rooted in a history of deception and return, with contradictory impulses visible in the confession to the Auditor and the choice to continue teaching luck through marbles. Embodied detail is strong—bent shoulders, patient cane, polishing marbles by breath—but the characterization leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than live micro-choices under pressure. The final stance crystallization (garden knowing him, breathing together) is earned by prior setup but the protagonist's agency is largely attentional and ritualistic rather than decision-driven with visible alternatives foreclosed. No therapy-speak or label-only traits; the change reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost in humility and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hale's internal world is richly textured through embodied perception ("icy warmth," mechanically warm smile practiced for years) and his motivation is clear. His past fall "between seconds" grounds his sideways-time obsession concretely. However, the emotional arc lacks genuine friction—his restraint and care face no meaningful internal contradiction, no cost for his patience, and the final choice to "ease the lever back" feels like a return to baseline rather than a transformation that forecloses a path. The piece gestures at emotional complexity but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The musician's interiority is concrete and specific—rosin powder on margins, the physical weight of the program—with motivation clearly rooted in anxiety channeled through listening. The decision to disrupt rehearsal with a "harsh harmonic" is earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of passive observation with visible cost (professional exposure). Internal contradiction operates subtly: the protagonist trusts a ghost more than colleagues, yet cannot articulate why. Minor slip: the ghost's teaching method (watermarks into letters) feels slightly convenient, though the protagonist's interpretive leap remains grounded in musical thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—grief learned through feeding avalanche logs to the oracle, silence weighed on a desiccant scale. Internal contradiction drives the piece: the narrator stayed silent to protect Luca yet that silence killed him, a contradiction that powers the final broadcast. The micro-choices (lifting graphite, speaking without apology, penciling the number small) are specific and cost-bearing. Minor slip: the oracle's anthropomorphized waiting ("waited without hurry") occasionally edges toward convenient sentience rather than pure projection.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes," the tag in cheek "like a coin against the gum"), with distinct perceptual filters (surveyor's eye, reckless explorer). Internal contradiction operates effectively—skeptical yet following "a kind of liturgy"—and micro-choices (turning the wheel, climbing down, pocketing the tag) reveal hierarchy under pressure. The mother's confession and the narrator's response earn the final stance, forecloses a path of denial, and the ledger discovery lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the father's presence is constructed entirely through objects and inference rather than direct memory or prior scene, which keeps emotional charge slightly abstract at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chronicle keeper's interiority is carefully rendered through concrete perceptual filters ("roots burrow through old atlases," "mushrooms foxed the leather") and a consistent stance of witnessing without verdict. However, the narrator remains largely observational; their choices—reinforcing the swan, planting cuttings—are responses rather than initiating pressure. The child and refugees are handled in summary, not scene, so relationships as crucible never materializes. Internal contradiction is minimal; the keeper's stance is coherent but static, limiting agency-driven transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The therapist narrator's motivation to "nurture lifelong wonder" and "softly adaptive" method are shown through micro-choices: asking permission, waiting for Felix's response, refusing to "force sound from a throat that needed time." Felix's journey from silence to singing "mama" is earned through the bowl/heel call-and-response sequence. Interior contradiction appears in the narrator's "cautious exuberance," and Lena's whispered dream versus acceptance of slow process shows embodied tension. Minor: the therapist's professional expertise reads as gentle but lacks a visible personal cost or blind spot that complicates the session.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's interior life is embodied through concrete sensory engagement—listening to bronze quiet, feeling diaries tremble, aligning his spine to the displaced axis. His motivation (collecting wall-stories) drives each micro-choice: setting the tapestry, reading aloud, probing with sentence edges. However, the character remains more vessel than agent; his perceptual acts accumulate texture but he faces no genuine internal conflict or foreclosed path with visible cost. The final move (inscribing to let walls rest) feels like fulfillment rather than transformation earned through contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei shows clear interiority and purpose-driven choices (seeding fortunes, arranging the lighthouse gathering), but her inner contradictions remain underexplored. The secondary cast (ferryman, schoolteacher, constable) lacks individuated pressure; they arrive as summoned witnesses rather than sources of friction. The final tea-pouring lacks visible cost or a credible path foreclosed; Mei orchestrates without personal trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Father Ruan's motivation is clear and embodied through his loop-pedal work; his rhetorical tactics and care for Mara drive the scene. The entity's hunger is dramatized through its specific desire for "the flat" and "one plane," giving it distinct interiority. Mara's thinning voice and the paint-speckled wrists provide concrete embodiment, though her agency is somewhat passive until the final beat where she "could put down" the palette. The renunciation/loosening at closure is earned by Ruan's accumulated questions and the entity's recognition of its hunger as "a door, not a throne."

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's interiority is poetic and concrete ("chronologically homesick, aching for afternoons that smelled of pencil shavings"), with embodied emotion in the climbing and shell-handling gestures. The conductor metaphor structures motivation consistently, but the final choice—tracing circles and holding tones—feels more symbolic than a genuinely conflicted decision with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present in wanting return without retreat, yet the stance crystallizes through ritual rather than a fraught trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's interiority is dense and image-driven, with embodied tension ("the tablet was my map and my mirror… warm as a pulse"). The protagonist's arc from floating resistance to grounded arrival is earned, and the final choice to walk "like everyone else" carries visible cost. However, the middle beats lean heavily on abstract self-reflection ("versions of myself staring through the balusters") without sufficient contradictory impulses acting in scene; the guard encounter and mother-memory feel more allegorical than psychologically particular.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is established early and drives her to the cavern, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("guilt weighed less when shaped like an instrument") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation—"a tremor like a candle deciding to be fire again"—reads as declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Risto functions primarily as facilitator without applying independent pressure or forcing Lena to make a costly trade-off. The change feels asserted by lyric accumulation rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-recorder POV delivers consistent interiority shaped by professional habit ("I study the wind the way I study people"), with embodied stakes ("I felt the courtyard breathe"). The follower's arrival and her quiet test of the narrator's integrity creates relational pressure, and the final vow to keep the report "unowned even if it costs comfort" names a visible cost. However, the protagonist's choices operate mostly in reflection rather than in-scene micro-decisions under immediate pressure, and the internal voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic phrasing ("integrity likes a solitary room").

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator-poet demonstrates a consistent perceptual signature filtered through poetic compression ("breath like torn silk," "wrists still learning the meaning of wind"), but interiority remains largely observational rather than internally conflicted. The escapee's motivation—trapped in "a second that refuses to pass"—arrives late and is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to braid the rope and feed it through the whale's ribs shows agency, but the decision path lacks genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses another live option on the page. Embodied emotion is present in gestures (kneeling, stroking fibers) yet the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is rendered through concrete acoustic perception and her mendicant's bowl choices, showing character-specific bias. The piece establishes her motivation to find beauty in the unfinished, and the final choice to "refuse perfection and invite errors to sing" feels earned by prior acoustic exploration. However, the transformation lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the arc reads more as accumulative expansion than struggle. Secondary characters (the boy, the diver) apply pressure but remain functional rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy without drowning in either") is embodied through consistent professional detachment and the static-sensing method. Liora's arc from grief-paralyzed to steadied is earned through the calibrated accord and her micro-choices (offering the petal, nodding despite fear, reaching for the slate to steady herself). The dealer's final reflection on "affectionate detachment" and feeling "briefly clean, then uncarved again" completes a coherent internal contradiction. Minor deduction: the dealer's backstory and professional practice are told more than tested by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cargo broker POV demonstrates clear occupational filter ("instincts as a broker twitched") and sustained motivation to honor silent contributors. Interiority remains concrete through most beats ("I counted cranes like stars"). However, the narrator's voice occasionally lifts into generic uplift ("our continuous return") and the final third relies on summary rather than embodied choice under pressure, weakening the sense of immediate stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and purposeful: "Because my hands always build for others, I said, but no one knows my name where I sleep" demonstrates embodied longing. The shift from isolation to tentative belonging is earned through micro-choices (accepting Neri's terms, weaving the bench, dedicating it publicly). Emotions remain layered and contradictory—"luminescent ache" as both hunger and hope—without therapy-speak. Minor slips: some secondary characters (the neighbors) appear late without distinct pressure, though the ending choice to "dedicate this seat" forecloses solitary work and opens to community with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's curiosity and craft identity are concrete and embodied through sketching, pendant handling, and canal manipulation. The mentor's voice and guild warnings provide internal conflict, though the moment of defying them feels more stated than torn. The final choice to release the echo carries weight, but the "learning its own perimeter" beat could show more contradictory impulse. Emotional progression is specific and grounded through craft action rather than label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—setting glass eyes on stone, tracing triangles with wire—showing embodied pursuit of an impossible goal. The ambiguous loss of the apprentice drives motivation consistently, and the final stance (grief as practice, counting as touch) is earned through accumulated particulars. However, the apprentice's refractive figure lacks sufficient grounding in prior causality; the appearance reads more as symbolic gift than dramatized consequence of the protagonist's method, weakening the sense that internal contradiction compelled this exact outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied—"cupped it and felt the faint burr of recorded grit," "carry the fragment in my cheek like a coin"—showing choices under pressure. The motivation to become visible is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (threading the screw with a silver hair, placing the note). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between remaining "shy architecture" and stepping forward visibly. The final act of stepping from the pipe door, offering tools, and waiting is earned by prior causal work, though the cost is felt more than dramatized in a decisive forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nursery owner's interior world is specific and contradictory: "my certainty itched where the glove of routine had always fit" captures embodied discomfort with lost mastery. The shift from wanting control to accepting humility emerges through concrete micro-choices (opening channels, widening swales, letting moss claim posts). Theo functions as a useful foil whose question about the leaf "choosing routes toward survival or toward me" sharpens the protagonist's stake. Minor slip: the father's teaching arrives late and feels grafted rather than woven into earlier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter's interiority is consistently embodied through concrete perception ("my ribs ring like struck brass"), and the motivation to "thresh meaning from experience" drives every key choice from following the brooch to scaffolding the chapel. Internal conflict shows in the painter's hunger balanced against collaborative openness with Mara. The final choice—painting the map publicly—feels earned by the arc, though the earlier statement "I wanted nothing but to thresh meaning from experience" edges toward declaring rather than showing the value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clairvoyant narrator exhibits consistent internal contradiction ("didn't see it coming") and embodied interiority ("my uncertainty rings like a bowl, sweet and alarming"). The pilgrim's agency at closure—nodding to invite the shadow into the vowel—feels earned by prior material and forecloses a path with visible cost (the shadow becomes resident). Minor: the pilgrim's trait of "traveled here through overlapping shadows" remains ornamental; no embodied emotion contradicts their smooth cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied choices (cleaning the valve, climbing the dais, organizing work crews). Internal contradiction appears in the "reactively visionary" paradox, though the protagonist's agency remains mostly observational rather than decisively transformative. The final renunciation—not blowing the trumpet—registers as earned endurance with cost, but the arc skews toward witness rather than struggle. Relationship dynamics with the boy and returned exiles apply pressure without deep testing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently lyric and metaphor-driven ("trembling certainty," "itch of unraveling mysteries"), but emotion is performed through abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Micro-choices exist (packing the satchel, clicking the punch) yet lack visible trade-offs or hesitation that would reveal competing impulses. The final "trembling certainty that I had kept the hour's appointment" reads as earned stasis, but the protagonist's renunciation or transformation remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Motivation is signaled early but the internal conflict—between charting for others and charting one's own silence—arrives late and is told more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's sympathetic skepticism ("I scoff the first time I heard it, then apologized") and relationship to Lio show interior complexity, and the choice to include painful memories demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract register ("sympathy had found a shape") rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats. The final choice to give up their own memory of abandoning Estera earns the closure, but the emotional progression feels more narrated than dramatized—we're told about courage and kindness more than we witness the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The immortal protagonist is rendered through specific interior texture—"I wanted space to refuse its duty"—and the motivation to escape boredom through curiosity is embodied in on-page choices (building coils, negotiating with Mara, guiding the fragment). The transfer of the curse to Mara is dramatized with visible cost: the protagonist's "name loosened in the ledger of days" and Mara inherits "unending errands." Interiority remains consistent and particular, though the secondary character Mara receives less development; her double-cross is telegraphed but her interior stakes remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives micro-choices throughout (tilting the ink pot, rehearsing grief as performance, paying the "tax" of a warning). Embodied pressure is strong: "Truth was that my city owed him the breath he still owned" operationalizes motive through action. The final choice to carry names to mothers earns closure by forfeiting safety for use. Minor slip: "ethics sharpened to a scalpel" borders on label-speak, but the surrounding concrete choices (coin over eyelid, threading shroud) anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and idiosyncratic ("incandescent restraint," measuring lamp hums to recover time), but agency remains observational rather than decisional—the daily routines of charting and gilding never face a test that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (staying vs. the valley's silence) but never crystallizes into a micro-choice that alters tactics. Embodiment is strong (kneeling to whisper to bark, warming hands above kettle), yet the final image of waiting for footsteps defers rather than earns stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's voice is strongly embodied through their unique perception ("filters reality differently, sifting noise for texture") and contradictory impulses—simultaneously gathering others' stories while losing their own name. Micro-choices appear in beats like pinning the label "to the wind with my gaze" and choosing silence over naming. The final teaching moment with the woman carries visible cost (giving up sole ownership of the method). Minor slip: the "death certificate error survivor" status remains more premise than internalized wound shaping on-page choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The myth-buster narrator shows embodied interiority ("gloomy cheerfulness fit me like a borrowed coat") and a clear arc from testing legends to honest listening. The apology scene ("I spoke the apology I had rehearsed for years") provides a micro-choice with visible cost that alters the present stance. However, the reflective mode dominates—exceeding 40% of the text—and while anchored to the cello/shell interaction, many beats summarize emotional states rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation (leaving the instruments to play) reads as earned, but the heavy reliance on abstract formulations ("certainty is a boat that never docks") and the lack of a second on-page character limit pressure and embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is poetic and specific ("culture shock absorber," "hopeful desperation had a smell, like citrus rind squeezed over rust"), but the piece leans heavily on labels and metaphorical self-description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to press the chip into both leaders' palms and broker the compromise feels motivated by prior setup, but the decision arc is more narrated than dramatized—we're told the dual allegiance becomes "a braid" rather than seeing the internal conflict wrestle itself out. Micro-choices under pressure exist (painting the herons, moving the parade), yet the emotional progression stays smooth and articulate throughout, lacking the credible irrationality or self-deception that high-band characterization demands.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"purposefully curious heart," the recited formulas to outlast fatigue—and the final choice to stop winding the camera carries visible cost ("there will be no second last"). Motivation is clear throughout and the emotional state is embodied through gesture (kneeling, breathing through the mask, tucking the paper strip). Minor weakness: the shepherd's pine anecdote, while thematically resonant, reads slightly as summary rather than lived contradiction in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's blindness generates purposeful constraints (water-bowl navigation, drone interpretation), and her repair choices are goal-driven. However, interiority remains thin; we see competence without internal contradiction or competing wants. Jaro and the yardhands are functional props rather than sources of relational pressure. The final stance—calm stewardship—feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's perceptual signature is distinctive—reading condensation as map, trusting window-taught discovery—and the motives (finding the singular convergence) drive sustained curiosity and risk. Embodied sensation appears in kneeling, scraping, tasting, breathing on ice. The choice to mark coordinates and walk back reflects earned endurance rather than decisive change, fitting Earned Stasis; the cost is subtle (waiting in cold, betting the trip on a hunch) but legible. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally approaches stock poeticism ("atlas editor with a stovetop kettle and a suspicion the world has one hidden eye") without micro-choices under immediate pressure in those lines.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell tuner remains abstract—described through poetic labels ("narrow man of lucid silence") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. His "infinitely patient" trait is asserted but never tested by an on-page cost or temptation that would reveal character limits. The narrator's interiority is thin; we observe the tuner's actions but rarely feel the narrator's own stakes or conflicted impulses driving choices. The boy's stamping moment offers a brief reversal, but the tuner's response is immediate correction without visible struggle, flattening what could have been a character-revealing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (helmet, gauges, netting) and micro-choices under pressure—the decision to stop kicking and "let the sea hold me" feels earned and character-specific. The mother's teaching about vessels becomes a lived motive that shapes action. Minor slip: the emotional register occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("lonesome splendor," "patient saints") that feels imposed rather than emerging from the diver's immediate crisis state, though this remains controlled enough not to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular ("chasing hush where truth once hid"), and the inheritance motif meaningfully shapes his approach. However, the extended lyric mode keeps micro-choices abstract—he "pried loose," "carried," "pressed"—without dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance (teaching others to separate "hush from hunger") feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict; the choice to act doesn't foreclose a live option with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is consistent and lyric-textured, with embodied choices (confessing the old leaving, asking to be taught) that drive the arc. The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" speech feels authentic to her character and creates contradictory impulses. However, the backstory of the "old leaving" and the cart remains abstract; we see the outcome (debt repaid) but not the internal contradiction or mistake that caused the original failure, which would have sharpened the renunciation at closure. The final act of "paying" reads more as thematic assertion than a lived choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator demonstrates clear interior texture through imagery ("hands still remember how to sew grief into nets") and embodied perception filtered through the wharf-weaver lens. The hauntingly optimistic trait is asserted but not tested under competing impulses; the journey proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains stable throughout—no contradictory wants act simultaneously in scene to deepen characterization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority around diaspora and faith ("warmly curious rather than brave"), but much of the character work lives in reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The decision to rebuild the sundial emerges from Aram's prompting more than internal conflict, and the final whispered promise feels declarative rather than costly. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("carried it as if carrying a sleeping bird"), but therapy-adjacent phrasing like "rebuild the road between them" and "faith is not a treasure chest but a road crew" flattens peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinctive and consistent, with clear embodied choices (kneeling to redraw chalk, weighing the letter) and a coherent internal hierarchy built around margins and codes. Mira's presence applies pressure through the letter-handling beat, though she remains relatively static. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the narrator's professional role and personal investment in Oona's legacy, but the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than dramatized conflict between impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tamsin's interiority is specific and embodied: her "disguise her listening as idle chatter" trait shapes scene choices, and her method of testing "adjacent possibilities" through stitching offers concrete character-particular perception. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fear and determination ("she told herself her task was simple"), and micro-choices under pressure—breathing on the flame, stitching the waning moon beside Rauk's name—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final agency is clear: she delays the coup by altering the orrery's timing, an act of renunciation (accepting the coup will still come) that forecloses certainty with felt cost. Minor: Rauk remains functional but one-note, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("hunger and pride are patient engineers") rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation—seeking "the moment before deciding"—is embodied and drives choices throughout. The emotional arc from avoidance to staying is earned through the journey; the splinter-steadied hand and reaching fingers are concrete. However, the brother remains a static object of regret rather than a fully realized second character, and the medium's "fierce tenderness" edges toward therapy-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction. The final choice forecloses the path of escape with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The translator's motive is concrete and particular—"to graft new meaning onto old wounds"—and drives the decryption task with genuine stakes. Internal contradiction surfaces in the weighing of truth ("not every truth heals") and the final act of selective translation that balances protection and honesty. Embodied emotion appears in "lotus-hearted ache" and "unknot my scarf to pad the rail," both gestures grounded in physical action. Minor weakness: Sifa remains thinly drawn beyond his symbolic function, and the waiting families are more schematic than individuated, though their convergence at closure is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's internal texture is consistently voice-specific (lanterns, projectors, "purse of spare dawns"), and the motivation to rediscover lost joy shapes several micro-choices (baiting roots with marmalade, letting the display blur back). However, the protagonist's arc reads more as enactment than struggle—no contradictory impulse threatens the mission, and the grandmother's wink delivers wisdom without dramatized resistance. The final choice to "let the display blur" and leave the fragment beneath roots feels thematically apt but arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The restorer's interior is vivid and distinct—"exchange certainty for curiosity" anchors motivation—but choices are predominantly observational. The nested-self recognition moment ("I see then that I am in the mural as well") offers conceptual richness yet remains reflective rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The piece establishes a perceptual signature but lacks an on-page decision that forecloses a path under pressure, capping the score despite strong embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece offers a coherent collective "we" POV with interior access to defiance and strategy, but individual differentiation remains thin—Ilya is "charming" and "candidly cryptic" by label more than by contradictory impulse in scene. The final renunciation (planting messages, letting collectors retreat) carries conceptual cost but lacks a foregrounded micro-choice that tests competing values with visible friction. Embodiment is present (ribs as slatted sunlight, beetles trembling) yet emotional progression stays declarative: "we laughed tax free" tells satisfaction without showing the bodily relief or fear that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The insomniac poet's interior voice is distinct and sustained—"drink the dark and exhale petals" anchors character-particular perception. However, the protagonist reads more as observer than agent through most beats; choices (gathering chalk, drawing the circle, singing) feel ritualistic rather than forged under competing pressures. The Guard's moment ("eyes wet, and mutters something about his mother and thorns") adds embodied texture, but secondary pressure from the blossoms remains abstract—red "coughs," white "sighs," thorn "clicks"—without individuated resistance that forces trade-offs. The final softening ("Red unfurls a quiet petal; white folds a thorn inward") lands as earned stasis, yet the lack of on-page conflict between the protagonist's want (armistice) and a visible cost (what is renounced or risked to achieve it) keeps this in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The caretaker's systematic care is embodied through concrete actions (lighting wicks, measuring splits, cataloging), and her interior contradiction between duty and "foxglove regret" operates continuously. Micro-choices like letting the chime remain cracked and opening the mezzanine window reveal hierarchy of values. However, the stakes remain largely symbolic—she never faces a hard choice between competing goods with visible cost, and the final act of winding the chime reads more as ritual than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motives (repair collaboration, restore trust) are clear and embodied through concrete actions—writing vows, confessing vanishing—that create authentic internal friction. The reconciliation arc shows genuine cost: "Silence had once been my shield... and it had cut her like glass." However, interiority occasionally tips into therapeutic self-diagnosis ("my vanishing," "map the boundary between focus and forgetting") that softens pressure at key beats. Mara remains functional but underdrawn; her "cautious exuberance" and strategic forgiveness support the arc without independent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific ("I tremble" followed immediately by its conversion to tighter grip), with embodied tension throughout. The mentor relationship and its posthumous influence motivate present choices with clear emotional cost. However, the protagonist remains largely unopposed by other characters; the council's resistance dissolves quickly without meaningful internal conflict for the narrator, and the resolution feels earned more by discovery than by a hierarchy of competing values tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particularized—"trust cracked like shell, so I gathered the shards in shoeboxes" embodies emotion through specific action. Internal contradiction operates well: the impulse to refuse Ezra's request conflicts with the attic's unspoken demand and the melody's echo of Mara. The final choice to send Thimble and accept Ezra's grip as balance feels earned by the prior causality of lost trust and the meteorite's anchoring function. Minor: some reflection edges toward summary rather than dramatized micro-choices, but the stakes remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is concrete and particular ("featherly determined," grain-reading as inheritance), and micro-choices—holding the logbook to light, stepping through the frame—embody stakes without therapy-speak. The argument memory and the realization "he chose the day of fog" ground the father relationship in contradictory impulses (anger, stubborn love, grief). Emotional progression is realistic, layering memory with present perception. Minor slip: the final epiphany about attention and distance skirts abstraction but remains anchored in the desk creak and open frame.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is specific and poetic—"stitcher of coastlines and constellations"—but the core motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") remains abstract through most of the piece. The character makes micro-choices (unrolling notebook, using burnt feather, breathing with Mara) that embody curiosity rather than conflict. The final realization ("breathing each other into day, patient and newly named") feels earned by accumulation but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Mara is present and applies gentle pressure, but her role is primarily guide rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's occupation and method are established through vivid particulars (crater glass, transliteration), but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bright sorrow," "cheerful gloom") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The promise to the bird and the final stance feel asserted rather than earned through a visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (brushing seeds, pressing glass) but the protagonist's internal conflict never dramatizes competing impulses simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The performer's analytical mindset is clearly established and his micro-choices (chalking the grid, tossing the ribbon, positioning the bishop) reveal a consistent worldview. The woman's emergence and her own diagonal-thinking nature feel earned. However, the performer remains more concept than contradictory impulse; his internal conflict is declared ("orchestrated serendipity") rather than dramatized through competing wants under pressure. The final gift of the bishop carries weight, but the cost of the exchange—what he or she forecloses—remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tide dancer's motivation is clear and consistent—fidelity to a banned art form drives every choice. The encounter with the watcher provides genuine dramatic friction, and the protagonist's spontaneous teaching decision feels earned by the scene's pressure. However, the internal life remains somewhat abstract; phrases like "allegiance to something deeper than decree" tell more than embody contradiction. The final choice to teach the watcher carries visible cost (risk of exposure, intimacy with authority) but could be more viscerally anchored in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glazier's interior is rendered through concrete particulars—glass dust in cuffs, breath warming panes—and micro-choices under pressure (tilting the fractured pane to create rainbows, choosing whom to face via pond-reading). Motivation coheres around illuminating mundane value through patient craft. The harbor master's shift from skepticism to willingness feels earned by the visible beauty demonstration rather than argument, though his conversion arrives quickly. Minor: the glazier's voice remains consistent but could show more internal friction or cost when facing demolition threat.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The firefighter's motivation is grounded in guilt over the subdivision/saddle triage decision, and his carrying of the box with relics provides embodied interiority. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract reflection—"translate pain into a universal language," "hard softness that wanted to be learned"—rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The encounter with Mira offers witness but minimal interpersonal friction; the final choice (leaving the box, vowing return) reads as Earned Stasis but lacks the visible cost or foreclosed path that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist displays consistent interior contradiction—method versus fear, neatness versus vulnerability—culminating in the mirror-among-shells moment that earns the final stance. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular ("lucidly watchful," "patient lung," "ache for repair"), though the collective village perspective dilutes individual stakes in the second half. The "logical dreamer" persona drives micro-choices (altitude gauge repurposing, decoration placement), but the shift from solitary experimenter to community facilitator lacks a visible psychological cost that would elevate the change. Embodied emotion appears in key beats (breath relighting balloons, chest-pull matching needle), preventing therapy-speak from dominating.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is poetic and specific ("chalking curves along the skirting as if tracing veins"), but the internal conflict lacks genuine contradiction—the narrator moves through discovery without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's choice ("She chose the collection over a man stranded on the stairs") provides retrospective tension, but the protagonist's own stakes feel more observational than agonistic. The final renunciation (letting the knocking become a lull) reads as earned by prior material, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Embodied emotion is present but leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("legacy's burden felt lighter") rather than contradictory sensory experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The painter is characterized primarily through lyric declaration rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm, yet aware of every tremor"—without showing competing impulses acting simultaneously. Lio's reaction to the mirrors is conveyed through gesture ("gasped and laid the slate"), but the internal experience stays label-only. The borrowed heartbeat device is told rather than dramatized as a constraint that shapes decision-making on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The negotiator's interior life is embodied through gesture (furrowed brow, breath shared with prison choirs, reed on tongue) and weighted by explicit past failure (the ambush/clinic trade-off, twenty-seven silenced). The choice to offer silence as bond—"I will speak no more for any army"—carries genuine cost and forecloses a path. Internal contradiction surfaces when the narrator shelves one truth to save another and loses both, then offers breath as collateral in a second high-stakes gamble. Minor slip: the General and Matriarch remain more symbolic than individually distinct, their gestures (charred wrist, white fist) functional but not voice-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's interior voice is richly contradictory—"amoral philanthropist" who is "secretly sentimental"—and micro-choices (placing the egg, timing the valve release, planning then narrowing the water release) embody that tension with visible cost. The renunciation of the "drastic thing" (full water release) in favor of "narrower grace" feels earned by the ledger-versus-mercy calculus established early. Minor slip: the self-aware labeling ("They call me an amoral philanthropist, and it is not inaccurate") edges toward diagnostic clarity that no one has mid-crisis, though the subsequent concrete actions ground it. Embodied emotion is strong throughout ("tremor that said I belonged to it").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's motivation to defy conformity is clear, and her chaste-courtesan paradox creates interesting tension. However, her interior life relies heavily on abstract poetic declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to untangle the city's braid feels more ceremonial than earned through specific internal conflict—we see her *do* the ritual but don't witness competing impulses or a cost that forecloses another path. The guild's arrival is too late to test her resolve, leaving agency more declarative than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurel's interiority is concrete and character-specific—"hive of second thoughts," the weight of the story stick. His arc from bravado to recognition of harm, then to genuine apology and structural reform, is earned by on-page reflection and the troupe's pressure. The final micro-choices (sending the message, brewing coffee, rehearsing a new structure) embody cost and renunciation. Minor slip: Ferro and Miri remain sketched rather than individually contradictory, though their presence suffices to force the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinct and sustained—"esoteric realist" philosophy and embodied attention to wind, weight, and signal-building anchor the POV. Emotional texture is present in the moth-wing handling and grandmother seed-sack memory, though these reflections remain more lyric than contradictory. The final choice to leave the knot and descend feels consistent but lacks internal friction; the protagonist's stance never wavers or faces a dilemma that would test competing impulses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lost-wax caster's motivation is embodied through sensory particulars (breath sparking like tin shavings, bronze running in channels) and the technical skill directly shapes the climactic action. Internal contradiction surfaces in the guilt-versus-purpose dynamic, and the final choice to stay feels earned by the forgiveness frame. Minor deduction: the teacher and market trauma remain largely told rather than dramatized in micro-choices that test present options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist "Only" demonstrates clear interiority through embodied perception ("the air tasted of rust and rain") and micro-choices (breaking the seal, choosing to slow, turning left toward mercy). Internal contradiction operates through the tension between arriving late and still choosing to engage, though the embodied struggle could be sharper during peak decisions. The final collective choice with other walkers shows agency, but the transition from solitary seeker to group facilitator feels slightly under-motivated—the protagonist's shift to telling others what the directive means lacks visible internal resistance or cost in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The astronomer's frugality and empirical devotion create a coherent interior logic that drives his choices throughout. His embodied actions—counting instruments "like coins he dared not spend," kneeling with the tile—ground motivation in physical gestures rather than labels. The final choice to place the tile and speak the vow arises organically from prior causality, though the renunciation lacks a felt interpersonal or moral cost that would elevate the stakes. Internal contradiction is present but muted: his "empirically ironic faith" wavers only briefly before the bronze eyelid, limiting the pressure of genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist exhibits clear motivation and interiority through cellular memory work, with embodied emotion in moments like "rage surged, and the sanctuary absorbed it." Mara's arc from "eyes bright with the kindled stiffness of someone unwilling to cry" to releasing resentment shows transformation, though the final shift feels slightly abrupt given the brief on-page time. The relationship pressure between protagonist and Mara drives choices effectively. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent language ("teach resentment to release," "cells remember") that occasionally edges toward diagnostic framing, though mostly dramatized through the music box ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Iren's motivation is clear and his grief-rooted goal drives actions throughout. Interiority is heavily metaphoric but remains character-specific ("he needed truth more than polished show"). The mirror-making craft and grief anchor embodied choices, though internal contradiction is minimal—he proceeds methodically without significant wavering. The final choice to "let it move and belong" rather than trap the dream earns a modest shift in stance, but the cost feels more stated than viscerally enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mender's interiority is concrete and textured—"quartz because a shard sits where my left eye once looked"—and micro-choices (kissing the air before using the ribbon) reveal values under pressure. The motivation to bridge generational wisdom threads through repair work and the remembered daughter without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional duty and personal grief, embodied in the pocket ribbon. The kids function as secondary pressure that forces on-page demonstration rather than abstraction, though their voices occasionally blur together.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The curator's interiority is concrete and specific ("brightened disquiet humming in my ribs"), and embodied choices appear throughout—refusing direct inheritance, using the cameo in a non-prescribed way, meeting the young woman on a "third road." However, the protagonist's agency reads more as philosophical attention than decisive action under contradictory pressure. The final choice to capture "the breath of the orchard" rather than a face feels thematically coherent but lacks visible friction or internal contradiction in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear interiority through botanical grammar and careful resourcefulness that constrains choices (trading "calyx for caveats"). The motivation to find the unlearned lessons library drives on-page decisions, though the time traveler's arc feels thinner—his key realization ("never learned to apologize to himself") arrives quickly without embodied struggle. The final choice to trade "right to forget today" shows visible cost and forecloses a path. Minor slip: the traveler's emotional state reads more summarized than lived during his footnote trap.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I carried an emerald swatch card from a paint shop, edges frayed by pocket storms"), with embodied micro-choices threading the exploration. The discovery of the twin and the collaborative act of speaking names demonstrates earned internal progression. However, the motivation remains largely abstract—"chimera twin discoverer" and "recapture the lost" function more as thematic labels than dramatized wants with visible internal friction. The final choice to tell "the worst part together" arrives without prior micro-contradictions that would make the cost feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's methodical nature shapes every move—warmly methodical trait embodied in line-by-line tactile engagement with rope, gears, and archive patterns. Internal contradiction between curiosity and caution plays out when stepping through the door ("warmed my hands and my thoughts"), and the trait-driven approach to "reading patterns as if they are weather for the mind" constrains tactics throughout. The ending choice to prepare a finding aid and invite witnesses feels earned by prior archive devotion, though the final beat lacks a sharper cost or renunciation that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mapkeeper's interior landscape is distinctive—tasting metal and snow, understanding quiet as lattice rather than absence—and micro-choices (pressing the stone to ice, setting it on the drum) feel earned by prior perception. The narrator's arc from "mistook quiet for absence" to collaborative tuning with the energy beings shows genuine learning through on-page struggle. Minor slip: the energy beings remain somewhat abstract; their "hungering" is asserted more than embodied, and their dimming "to listening" lacks the physical particularity the mapkeeper receives. The final mutual discovery carries visible cost (waiting, measuring breaths) but the beings' interiority stays opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kera's interiority is concrete and embodied ("palms to the trembling panes," "tilt her senses backward as if time were shallow water"), and her retrocognitive ability shapes on-page choices (touching the prism, adjusting the shard). Internal conflict between ritual and proof is present, and the final choice to signal a return is earned through the accumulation of sensory particulars and micro-adjustments. Minor deduction: the boy who traded the shard exists only as backstory prop without on-page pressure, and some phrases ("thistle-blown hope") risk label-speak, but embodied action at closure recovers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archivist's internal life is rendered through poetic abstraction ("preemptively nostalgic…the way potters mourn a vase before the kiln") but lacks concrete embodied contradiction under pressure. The final shift—"I unbind the earlier fear, speak it into glass"—reads as a stated epiphany rather than a dramatized struggle with visible cost. Motivation is consistent but never tests competing impulses in scene; the protagonist moves smoothly from conjecture to validation without genuine friction. Interiority remains high-register and diagnostically self-aware throughout, flattening urgency at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lio's motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is clear and drives his methodical setup, but his interiority remains largely opaque—we see him chant, smile, and measure, yet contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene. Mara's cousin's disappearance adds secondary pressure, but her choice to light the fuse reads more as participation than as a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending gesture (packing slowly, "serious playfulness") suggests endurance rather than transformation, yet no prior internal conflict is dramatized enough to make that renunciation earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly particular—"I listened sideways, to light skimming barnacles"—and contradictory impulses emerge through the tension between cataloging (observational safety) and relational risk. Embodied emotion lands in gestures like "my hand kept the hinge warm" and the cicada pressing cool against skin. The final choice to "cross this mouth of water with you until the footing names itself" earns Earned Stasis through sustained causality, though the reflective density occasionally abstracts immediate pressure. Minor penalty for elevated diction at peak beats ("crossings between states were holy work") that tilts toward thematic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's claustrophobia and its embodied manifestation—"my ribs fencing with themselves"—drives micro-choices throughout (limiting doll exposure, training listening "the way gardeners train vines"). Internal contradiction appears consistently: fear of enclosed spaces versus need to master enclosed silences. The final shift from seeing the bunker as cage to recognizing "even fear can be engineered into shelter" earns the change through prior sensory work. Minor: the emotional progression reads slightly overstated in places ("walls sprinting inward"), nudging register toward elevated diction, but the perceptual signature remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The gondola operator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("rails tutored me," "fluidly logical"), with embodied perception through the storm glass and meter. The core choice—teaching the girl to space the bell's rings—shows micro-agency under pressure and alters the mother's stance. However, the protagonist's emotional arc remains stable rather than contradictory; no internal conflict complicates the helping impulse, and the resolution feels assured rather than forfeited with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maris is given clear interiority and a distinct role, but her moment-to-moment choices feel reactive rather than genuinely conflicted. The grandmother backstory provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction between competing impulses. The final act—placing her palm on the radio throne—arrives without visible struggle or cost, making the character arc feel complete by declaration rather than earned transformation. No embodied contradictions act simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Keeper's interiority leans heavily on abstract, lyric assertion ("I am the tender shadow keeper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The figure's suffocation is described but never enacted through concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses; the scar at the neck remains a static symbol. The teaching sequence offers embodied breath-work detail, yet the visitor's transformation lacks causally earned resistance or visible cost—trembling at "staying" is told, not shown through a choice that forecloses a path. Motivation reads coherent but remains at a declarative distance, capping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction—pyramid-scheme survivor now seeking transformation without exploitation—creates tension, but the interiority relies heavily on metaphoric abstraction ("concepts become physical," "grammar could rive carbon") rather than embodied emotion. The volunteering choice arrives with clear motivation (debt, anti-pyramid ethos), though the chamber sequence prioritizes atmosphere over micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The parallel-dimension texts gesture toward internal multiplicity but function more as ornament than dramatized conflict between impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to uncover hidden truth drives clear micro-choices (winding the crank, interpreting the signs, choosing to keep the tin). Interiority is often concrete and embodied through interaction with objects. However, the emotional arc feels somewhat abstract—the narrator processes discovery through metaphor ("noose," "bridge") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "keep listening" reads as thematic stance rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The knight's interiority is built through embodied perception—visor clouding, armor unsnapping—and his progression from war-bound to possibility-tending reads as earned. However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstraction ("shivering bliss," "loneliness loosened") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to tend possibility feels thematically declared more than dramatically wrestled, and the character's flaws never generate mistakes that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist POV is consistent and embodied through concrete micro-choices: opening the ledger, tying strings, packaging the button. Interior texture remains stable ("my heart breaks in archived increments") with character-particular diction. The final mailing decision carries visible cost (uncertainty about reception, the long hallway walk) and forecloses passivity. Minor deduction: some interiority edges toward poetic summary rather than immediate perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Jessa is motivated by a clear vow ("hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") and acts resourcefully throughout—fitting the key, bridging wires, jamming the relay—with visible physical stakes. However, her interiority remains abstract and label-driven: "carefully resourceful" and "stubborn custodians" are asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-hesitations under pressure. The contact's rescue and the crowd's witness feel convenient rather than earned by Jessa's prior tactical trade-offs, and no meaningful internal cost or foreclosed path registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The saxophonist's interiority is atmospheric but largely contemplative rather than contradictory; we see a sustained meditative stance shaped by past teaching, but few micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses in scene. The embodied fog-breath metaphor and the weight of the "vested hush" garment are vivid, yet the protagonist enacts a predetermined ritual more than wrestles with live options. Motivation is signaled early (hush the prophecy) and the protagonist's renunciation of sound feels earned by teacher lore, but the choice to return next season reads as acceptance rather than a forfeiture with visible internal cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Fen's interiority is often abstract and label-driven ("Mossy delight," "bound caution") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to release seeds is stated but not dramatized with visible internal conflict or trade-off in the moment; we're told he "reeled" and then trusted, but the competing impulses don't collide on the page. The progression from hoarder to releaser lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The transformation is asserted through poetic description rather than earned through scene-level struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tinkerer's progression from "predictably repaired by habit" to befriending uncertainty is earned through fire, discovery, and the underground machine work. Internal contradictions appear in embodied form: "hands wet and shaking" while improvising, "fear thinned" as breathing matches waterfall rhythm. The final shop with out-of-phase clocks and customers waiting "for the right moment" demonstrates a credible stance shift with visible cost—the protagonist now lives by rhythms instead of schedules. Minor weakness: the admiral's backstory is told rather than discovered through objects or documents that would charge the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's interiority is consistently embodied through work-specific perception ("broken ore," "wet nail") and contradictory impulses act simultaneously: the desire for precision wars with guilt over naming Mira's wildness as disobedience. The final choice to "go because balance is movement" forecloses simple redemption with visible cost. Minor deduction: some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("balance is a jealous arithmetic") rather than staying strictly grounded in sensory present, though the closure choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—"modestly fearless, or just practiced at keeping still" and the bargain to share the worst memory first. The journey from refusal ("I refused a drowning man") to integration shows earned change. Minor slip: the widow's laugh and the final laugh blur slightly in tracking, but the internal arc of pursuing joy alongside pain reads as motivated throughout. The final stance—"promising to flood when needed and stay when not"—forecloses the old evasion with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and contradictory—testing calibrated knees, looping the strap around the wrist without tightening, reading trauma responses as archive. Embodied trauma (wrists twisting apart, ribs clenching) drives micro-choices and the final boundary act of leaving the strap behind is earned by prior pressure. Minor deduction: the proprioceptive enhancement remains mostly a label rather than forcing on-page tradeoffs that constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is vivid and specific ("I follow a trail of oxidized hooks"), but motivation remains abstract—the desire to "honor overlooked histories" never faces a live on-page cost or contradiction that would force a hierarchy of values. The elder and Risa exist as evoked presences rather than dramatic pressure points; no relationship crystallizes under strain. The final "translation" beat feels declarative rather than earned through embodied struggle, and the protagonist's stance does not measurably shift or foreclose a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motives are consistent—ghosts send them, they follow—and the character demonstrates skillful observation in reading dust patterns. However, interiority remains thin; the narrator observes more than struggles. The watchmaker ghost delivers exposition rather than pressure, and the final choice to "unwind" the mechanism feels more symbolic than internally conflicted. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats are filtered through metaphor rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator's motivation is richly embodied through visceral action—loosening the press "until the resistances matched the grief"—and the internal contradiction between fidelity to system and courageous edit is dramatized. The voice remains character-particular throughout, with perception filtered through craft metaphors. The choice to destabilize the orchard is earned by the entire arc, though the Glasswright's late appearance and under-articulated position slightly weaken the relational crucible. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses sustain pressure without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Neris exhibits consistent motivation rooted in past revolutionary ideals, with embodied reflection ("defunct heart considers revolt again") and micro-choices that reveal values (presenting the shard in a sling, matching breath to storm). Internal contradiction is present but understated—revolutionary identity versus custodial duty—and the final shift feels more thematic than earned by dramatized cost. The piece leans heavily on reflective interiority; while anchored to present stimuli (the shard, the tribunal), the ~40% reflection load flattens some urgency, though it does not obscure present options.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The repairman's trait of wilting near dishonesty drives two key choices (respecting the elders' candor, naming his tools for courage), but interiority relies heavily on metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. "He felt that theft as a bruise in the harmonics" abstracts emotion when physical reaction would sharpen it. The covenant of rust receives more dramatic weight than the protagonist's internal conflict, leaving his agency partly ornamental. No major micro-choices under simultaneous contradictory impulses; the path from motive to action reads linear.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's sensory particularity (psychometry, petrichor collection) creates a consistent perceptual filter, and the choice to press the needle into the seam is embodied with consequence. However, interiority leans heavily toward atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final stance—caretaker of secrets—feels asserted more than earned through visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sculptor's interiority shows embodied emotion ("breathe the wet metal ozone that tastes like bitten nails") and the grandmother's teaching functions as motive. However, the protagonist's agency is mostly receptive—gathering, holding, following—rather than forcing difficult choices under contradictory impulses. The final decision to "reimagine the delivery" and "ask who has rope" is stated but not dramatized with visible cost or internal friction. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the layered contradiction and on-page struggle that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mural artist's interiority is grounded in concrete observation—watching glass, arranging postcards, waiting for moonlight—but the choices remain largely observational rather than high-stakes decisions. The motivation ("understand why flowers bloom at night") is treated more as contemplative quest than urgent need, so agency reads as passive witnessing. The final walk to the pavilion and the decision to "paint without asking for permission" arrives as epiphany rather than a choice forged under contradictory pressures. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (paint-stained fingers, holding the lantern low) but the protagonist's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's archival motive is clear and her commitment to "truth in tension" drives the decryption effort, but her internal contradiction never forces a costly choice—she agrees to Esteban's terms without dramatized struggle. The retrocognition device provides visceral access to Alma's world yet functions more as atmospheric overlay than constraint that complicates present action. Esteban's confession about the courier's betrayal lands with embodied weight ("closed his eyes, and the gondola rocked"), but Mara's final stance feels pre-formed rather than earned through on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is embodied through concrete choices: chalking plans on shale, setting glass jars where wells would be, coaxing algae into loops. Internal conflict operates through simultaneous impulses—remembering wishes as confetti that clogged gutters while choosing discipline over spectacle. The arrival of two women who "take places at the ropework and the kiln frames as if rehearsing memory" demonstrates relationship pressure, though their characterization remains thin. Minor deduction for the amber bottle functioning more as symbolic prop than embodied constraint on his hands-on work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oath scribe's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("memory has teeth like moths"), with contradictory impulses present: the desire to archive versus the knowledge that their work makes them complicit ("my name will be the knife"). The final choice—to witness rather than seal—is earned by the spiral of recognition through the grooves. Minor: the protagonist's agency is contemplative throughout; a single additional micro-choice under visible pressure in the middle third would have sharpened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular throughout ("grandmother's voice lives in that braid, all salt and root-cellar"). Embodied sensations anchor pressure: "Every breath I take beads the glass above with slow galaxies," "the kernel...rasps my skin with histories." The final choice to crown the hatchling with the spent cap shows earned transformation with visible cost (the cap "lighter now, because its memory has been spent"). Minor issue: the hatchling remains more symbolic cipher than individuated presence, though this serves the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is specific and controlled, with embodied choices (canceling the test, lowering mufflers, checking sensors) that reveal priorities under pressure. The stance crystallization—listening over spectacle—is earned through micro-choices throughout. Minor deduction: the reflection on "credibly curious" and "honored the solstice hush" edges toward self-congratulation without dramatized cost in those exact beats, though the broader renunciation (canceling the alarm) carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is densely particular ("I had ribs once broken by a grief I could not lift"), and the progression from isolation to teaching care is embodied through micro-choices (holding the lantern glass, opening shutters, passing the glass to the foreman). Internal contradiction appears in the paradox of strength through vulnerability, lived out in concrete gestures. The final stance—"quietly, enduringly"—earns its cost through the season's reprieve and the embodied ritual of mopping and blessing. Minor slip: the crew's turn feels slightly rushed, though the foreman forgetting the deadline supplies a visible moment of shift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is established early and her actions—tracing ownership, opening the box, arranging hives, breathing on panes—follow logically. Her interior state ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive") is shown through selective attention and gestures rather than diagnostic labels. However, the protagonist remains observational rather than choosing under meaningful internal conflict; she never faces a credible dilemma that forces competing impulses to act simultaneously. The final gesture (bowing, promising to carry weight) reads as acceptance rather than a costly choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority operates through rich, accumulative texture ("borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins"), and the final choice to return the coins demonstrates agency with visible cost. However, motivation remains largely told through poetic assertion rather than dramatized contradiction—the desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated but never tested against a competing impulse. The urn fragment exchange with Mara provides a micro-choice that tilts stance, but the protagonist's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous opposing wants acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied through concrete sensory engagement ("I listen for a way to answer gently") and contradictory impulses act in scene when the poet rises to "tend the delicate juncture between joy and its first misgiving." The poet's agency is demonstrated through micro-choices—offering the feather, kneeling to meet the boy's gaze—that foreclose the path of merely observing. Minor deduction: the father and boy remain somewhat under-individuated beyond their structural roles, though spatial choreography stays clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker's voice is distinct and consistent: embodied calm, technical precision, and philosophical stance cohere throughout. Interiority is concrete ("lungs whistled like reed flutes," "brazen calm was my only cloak") and micro-choices accumulate pressure—twine-redrawn paths, copper circuits, the diary entry proposing a pact. The terminal diagnosis drives a visible hierarchy of values (attention over fear, kinship over legacy), and the final ceremonial stance earns its weight through prior particulars. Minor: the orchard-as-character anthropomorphism occasionally flirts with personification that could feel convenient, but the pillar responses remain concretely physical (tremor, rhythm in soles) and the protagonist's embodied listening keeps the exchange grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious"), with embodied choices around the amber and pilgrimage design. However, the piece operates more as philosophical essay than dramatic character arc; the narrator's stance crystallizes rather than changes through visible cost. The envoys remain abstractions without individuated pressure. Internal contradiction appears in the setup (skeptic who refuses the dark) but doesn't drive on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coachman's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—translating bird calls, planting pods, speaking dead languages to seeds—and the veteran encounter dramatizes a credible secondary pressure with visible cost ("the scent fells him to quiet tears"). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between memorial duty and forward-looking gardening, shown through micro-choices like crushing dead reef to feed new growth. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak and grounds emotion in physicality ("wheels sainted with pollen," "green knuckles"). Motivation coheres across beats and the final renunciation of battle-noise for garden-signature feels earned by accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently filtered through metaphor-heavy perception ("ears were maps of old thunder"), creating a distinct voice. The motivation to find the brother drives concrete choices—assembling the phonograph, using the leaf as lens, following the map to turn the spindle—with visible forfeiture (copying letters, walking under constellations, bringing neighbors into the discovery). Internal contradiction is present but muted: grief drives the search, yet the narrator pauses to let Gable drink and gathers the community rather than hoarding the water. Embodied emotion appears in gestures like Gable's tail thumping and the narrator pressing an ear to rust, though some beats rely on metaphor over visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior landscape is richly embodied through temporally stretched shadows and the compass rose applique that grounds memory and present action. Micro-choices—laying paper, rerouting power, signing with the mother's name—reveal values under pressure. The "blessed pariah" identity is felt through isolation and the contradiction between trusted math and refused voice. Minor slip: the mother's teaching about true north borders on thesis statement but remains concrete enough to charge the final alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's "apprentice of wonder" identity provides consistent interior filtering, and Kestrel's chivalrous-thief persona is grounded in the driftwood knight confession. Internal conflict appears in "fear was a doorway I longed to open," but the piece leans toward poetic assertion over embodied contradiction—the narrator's fear never visibly complicates a choice on the page. The emotional arc from fear to embrace registers conceptually but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's internal voice is distinctive—trauma survivor wrestling with performance vs. authenticity—and the choice to "unbind" from false scripts drives meaningful movement. Embodied detail ("wrist still wore the faint ladder of scars") grounds emotion. However, interiority occasionally slips into lyric abstraction ("luminous absence taught me where to stand") that reads more poetic than character-particular. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost (coiling the red cord, marking pebbles on the chessboard), though the Custodian remains more archetype than individuated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's journey toward "understanding the shape of home" is consistent, but interiority remains abstract and metaphor-heavy rather than embodied. The seer's choices are observation-driven rather than pressure-driven; the protagonist's agency reads as guided acceptance more than active contradiction. The final realization that "buried talents are not skills but permissions" arrives as stated epiphany rather than dramatized reversal, and the cost—offering breath, leaving with a feather—feels symbolic rather than viscerally foreclosing a path. Backstory and reflection dominate without anchoring in micro-choices that alter present options.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The exiled tutor's interiority is consistently embodied through the pawn-rolling gesture and layered guilt over the prince's war. The motivation to forgive emerges through concrete action—knotting threads—rather than declaration, and the final choice ("forgive the prince, and forgive the tutor") forecloses self-hatred with visible cost (the pawn left in the tapestry). Minor deduction: the prince backstory risks becoming exposition, though it anchors present stakes. The protagonist's blindness to his own capacity for mercy until the puzzle demands it drives the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior is concrete and specific—paint on hands, throat raw from teaching games—and the desire to "refract a single truth into many" drives on-page choices that alter tactics (the poetry sessions, the final confrontation). Sister's death establishes contradictory impulses: grief mixed with defiant anger, innocence weaponized. The final stance crystallizes in "we will count you until you change shape," foreclosing passivity with visible cost (paint-stained hands, raw throat). Minor: the elders remain largely functional pressures without individuated resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interiority is concrete and embodied—holding breath underwater, greasing gloves with limefat, feeling for constellations in wounds—and micro-choices (dropping the charm into the crucible, whispering names to the mechanism) carry visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between doubt and the need to forge meaning, though it operates more as alternating states than simultaneous impulses in a single beat. The teacher's absent presence anchors motivation credibly, but the final choice to sacrifice the charm, while poignant, feels slightly pre-determined by thematic design rather than wrestling with a live alternative path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The painter's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—packing the shell, entering the cave, placing it on the pool—and the internal contradiction of "intimately aloof" shapes perception throughout. The final recognition of the stranger beneath his face and the decision to leave the canvas for the tide demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost. Interiority remains specific ("recognition finally exceeding patience") and avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the promise itself is somewhat abstract until dramatized through cave action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly specific ("jasmine…found me with a softness that felt like my name spoken into my hair"), with embodied perception filtering every sensory choice. The core motive—proving whispers work—drives micro-choices (wiping brass, humming to iron, pressing cork to lips) that accumulate pressure. Mara remains off-page until the final beats, limiting relational friction, but her arrival permits a brief embodied exchange ("I hold her elbows as if they are fragile masts") that earns the closure cost. Minor dock: Alder's interior remains opaque; his "jaw looking for argument" and final mirroring gesture hint at change but lack contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The navigator's interiority is vivid and particular—embodied detail (pressing the censer foot into palm) reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator polishes the relic "not to shine, but to persuade the past that it still has muscle," showing layered motivation. The relationship with Rowan creates genuine crucible pressure: "we measure the distance between us by the time delay, and by the number of names she can say before crying." Rowan remains largely off-page as voice only, limiting direct interplay, but the final renunciation ("I do not ask if the house still stands; I ask if their grief can breathe") forecloses reunion curiosity with visible cost and character-specific deflection.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's internal contradiction—rational method versus involuntary truth, distrust of magic versus desperate need—operates consistently under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "words poured clear...edges rounded" and "I hated that the eye was a smuggled relic, likely stolen." The choice to bury the eye beneath the truffle bed is earned by prior causality and forecloses the contraband path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the virus constraint is stated more than dramatized in early beats, and the group members (Mara, Jiro, Fen) remain functional but thinly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Old Partial's interiority is consistent and embodied through metaphor ("trusted what was missing more than what showed," "worrying puzzles the way waves worry pilings"). Motivation to decode the gesture is clear and drives sustained action across multiple beats. The borrowed-memory device introduces concrete sensory flashes that inform choice, though the mechanism leans slightly toward convenient revelation. The final choice to continue signaling beyond Mira's departure is earned by accumulated particulars and forecloses the need for external validation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's interior life is richly textured through embodied perception ("cataloged scraps of paper as if they were surviving stars") and his choices—locking the shop, following ants, installing the chip—trace directly from the sister's promise that weighs on him throughout. The shift from "lonely" as habit to active shelter-maker is earned through on-page decisions with visible social cost. Minor deduction: the sister remains offstage and the exact nature of her illness and promise could be more concrete to sharpen the internal contradiction that drives his initial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The queen's motivation to "unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" drives her ascent and binds her to the closure act, but interiority remains largely abstract—dreams "ransacked" her sleep, yet we see little embodied cost shaping micro-choices along the path. The mapmaker's presence adds pressure but his thin characterization ("night weather in his eyes") leans decorative. The final act of naming the fire and loosening the crown carries renunciation weight, yet the emotional contradiction (hypocrisy, self-deception) that would elevate the choice into the high 7s is absent; the decision reads more as ritual acknowledgment than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is clear and particularized through the reactor work, palette choices (Courage, Mercy, Patience), and the choreographed ritual with Lio. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator wants to measure presence but risks destroying its mystery through quantification—this tension surfaces in Lio's question "whether the metrics endanger the mystery." Embodied action is strong (touching the wrist, tipping vials, writing on tiles), but the final choice feels more like completion of a predetermined ritual than a decision under pressure that forecloses a live path. The piece leans heavily on metaphoric interiority ("desire is massful only when mirrored by respect") that borders on thesis-speak, and the relationship with Lio, while textured, serves more as witness than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lucid-dream-chronicler protagonist shows strong interiority through embodied perception ("jaded wonder clung to me like frost") and a consistent hierarchy of values (keeping the ledger, facing envy, refusing to be fooled). The method of "getting jealous of past selves until they spoke up" provides character-particular contradiction—envy as magnet generates multiple interior selves that pressure the present stance. The final choice to "keep the ledger…to keep the time honest" forecloses passivity with visible cost (older but kinder, accepting the bill). Minor slip: the surveyor/lover/child trio in the dream risks ornamental multiplication, though the verbs they offer ("stake…scent…play") do tilt present action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's transition from aromatherapist to clock-repair apprentice is earned through the backstory anchor ("He found me the day I could no longer swallow the oils I used to worship"), and the final choice to preserve the screw with a felt washer demonstrates micro-agency with embodied cost. Interiority is specific ("I map emotional terrain by rhythm and pause") and the reading of the midwife's emotional state through sound is well-embodied. The therapy-speak risk ("maps emotional terrain") is mitigated by concrete dramatization in the drip-reading scene, though it hovers near label territory in one or two spots.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular—crescent scars from failed glyphs, the red thread reminder—yet the embodied emotion often leans lyric rather than contradictory impulse. The moment "My fingers faltered remembering a rooftop fall" shows embodied emotion, and the choice to press the sugar pebble under the bowl's foot is a micro-choice that alters present options. The final agency (shedding the fear that words would trap) is earned by the reflective arc and the ritual pressure, though the internal conflict reads more as hesitation overcome than simultaneous contradictory drives. Interiority remains specific and avoids therapy-speak; the ending's earned stasis (accepting scars as shorelines) forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is densely specific ("byline that sold hauntings like sequins") and the apology-as-action stakes are embodied in wrist scars and trembling hands. Internal contradiction operates well: the narrator knows advice arrives "like bad weather" yet still plans to column-witness. Mara's presence and the ghost-exorcism push the narrator to micro-choices (wiring shelves, speaking the apology aloud), and the ending's partial reconciliation ("we did not forgive everything") earns the shift without therapeutic smoothness. Minor slip: Aunt Lin remains offstage voice rather than fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("wanderingly exact," "resounding hush") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. The mentor's aphorism and the dictionary consultations gesture toward characterization but never constrain a live decision with felt consequence. The final declaration "We unify by agreeing to be seen through one another" reads as thesis rather than earned shift, and no prior action forecloses a path or imposes visible price. The character witnesses and narrates but does not struggle between competing impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied pressure in the counting-backwards rituals and the micro-choices around valves and floats. The father's legacy and the mantle clock key create a layered motivational frame that drives the protagonist's stance toward boundaries and time measurement. Internal contradiction operates through the tension between wanting understanding and accepting mystery ("we measure the changes we can bear"). Minor slip: some reflection edges toward platitude ("sharpen patience"), but the hydraulic work and squinting rituals ground the arc sufficiently to hold the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal contradictions—probability professor versus compulsive gambler's daughter, responsibility versus risk—are consistently embodied through micro-choices (lighting the lantern, following the scrawls, bringing carrots). The father's characterization is vivid through sparse detail: refusing soup "to prove the house could not win," the "tired smile I knew returned like an old train." Interiority remains concrete and particular ("my pulse that kept miscounting"), and the final choice to stay and hold space together is earned by accumulated pressure. The ending stance crystallization—holding him through "widening perspectives responsibly"—feels motivated, though the phrase edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The operator's interiority is concrete and specific ("I decided to study the art of distance") and motivations are embodied through the glass harmonica disc ritual and wrong-number interventions. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between cultivated estrangement and intimate involvement, though the operator's emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we see technique more than personal cost. The widow and baker sequences demonstrate clear embodied emotion and micro-choices, but the operator's own loss ("a letter on plain paper said goodbye in three straight lines") functions more as backstory credential than present wound that complicates choices. One hairline slip: the operator's renunciation of connection feels declared rather than tested on the page with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and role-specific, with embodied emotion ("the euphoria that touches my throat is haunted by her absence"). Motivation intensifies through micro-choices (pressing the locket into the ledger, speaking her name, refusing to write her back into the roll). Internal contradiction appears when duty and grief overlap ("I can only write the ache she made useful"), and the final choice to close the locket demonstrates renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "exact flavor of duty" edges toward over-articulation but doesn't flatten the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation ("to find the cure for loneliness without calling it medicine") is concrete and drives choices—trading attention for stories, designing rumor systems. The desperately jocular affect appears in dialogue tags and beat color but remains decorative; it never constrains a choice. Internal contradiction surfaces in "felt seen only by their needs, which was close enough to love that she did not correct the difference," yet this recognition does not force a visible trade-off or forfeiture. Secondary characters (surveyor, mechanic, mother) apply fleeting pressure but serve demonstration over escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapmaker's motivation is clear and his embodied perception ("tasted its grammar ripple through his skin") anchors interiority in concrete sensation. The craft metaphor and memory of "a winter when words would not hold him" provide backstory that primes the closure choice. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; his micro-choices under pressure are few, and the final act—kneeling, tracing the tone into the ring—reads more as ritual reception than a stake-altering decision with visible cost. The grief and sorrow mentioned early never surface as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—"I took responsibility, because responsibility is something you can hold while the cosmos misbehaves"—and contradictory impulses (fatigue versus precision, heroics versus listening) drive the key repair choice. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, earning the pen-warming sequence. Minor deduction: Mara's characterization remains instrumental; her voice and agency serve primarily to anchor the narrator's arc rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is specific and lyrical, with concrete physical engagement (lifting camera, signing). However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The advisor's motivation and decisions remain opaque—she orchestrates but we never see her weigh costs or face internal conflict. The final "keep this" moment feels declarative rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's "analytically intuitive" trait drives the pattern-reading that propels the search, and the final choice to preserve rather than destroy shows earned alteration. Interior contradiction appears in the arsonist who "listen[s] to what [flames] try to say" rather than worshipping destruction. However, Mira's motivations for vandalism and self-exile remain tellingly vague, and the protagonist's voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("desire computes trajectories even numbers envy") that strains credibility under crisis pressure. The closure choice—keeping matches in water—embodies renunciation with visible cost, but the path there leans heavily on convenient discoveries rather than forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("quietly rebellious even against grief"), with embodied emotion throughout. The drumming method evolves into a fully realized micro-choice system that channels grief and agency simultaneously. Internal contradictions appear ("I would accept the blur that spelled our names together" versus survival instinct), and the final renunciation—accepting outline blur for shared presence—carries visible cost. Minor slip: Jonah remains more echo than person; his characterization lives primarily in memory rather than present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: the zodiac coin "oily from years," the whisper-vent key filed to "a question," the ability to identify walks by how "footsteps leaned or paused on rusted grating." Embodied emotion appears in the tears "bright as the aurora" and the careful folding of maps "so that sound ran downhill." The protagonist's choices—selecting vents, timing whispers, reading the courier's dragging left foot—are micro-decisions under pressure that reveal a hierarchy of values (patience over volume, kindness over dominance). One deduction: the mother's backstory about reading tides by stars feels slightly generic, and the reflection on "gentleness travels" borders on thesis-stating rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian's motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (mirror angling, shutter work, finger-raise silence). Interior contradiction appears in the tension between the vow and the urge to intervene, driving measured action. The boys are sketched lightly but their silent exchange and the older brother's near-drowning register as credible under the situational lens. Minor slip: the phrase "something older we both understood" edges toward label-only abstraction without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coach's interiority is distinctly rendered through synesthetic perception ("heard the groan of worry, the metallic clink of ambition") and embodied choices, avoiding stock phrasing. The metaphorical language ("cradle pawns and kings the way you cradle hopes") sometimes edges toward over-articulation but remains voice-consistent. The final choice to "cradle the town until it chooses itself" earns its renunciation through prior causality with visible cost (forgoing direct confrontation). Minor deduction for the tendency toward elevated register in peak moments that occasionally distances rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dock worker narrator possesses a distinct perceptual signature—"argue with the sea the way you scold a beloved child"—and embodied choices (pushing off, planting the scrimshaw). However, interiority leans heavily on declarative, therapy-adjacent phrasing: "I want to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" reads as stated thesis rather than lived contradiction. The final transformation ("I hear my true name answered") is asserted more than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the stakes around identity feel abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The performer's interior is richly contradictory—former compliance officer turned sheltering hermit—with embodied emotion in whittling, narration rituals, and the dried bouquet. The moral ambiguity is dramatized through neighbors' wariness and the inspector scene, where he neither smiles nor weeps but offers "faithful" instead of "cheerful." The micro-choices (offering the bouquet, narrating boot removal, planting carved birds) reveal a hierarchy of values scaled to grief work. Minor slip: the "emotional void he tends like an austere garden" risks slight abstraction, though subsequent whittling and narration ground it concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cloud-shadow poet has a clear motivation (to dissolve boundaries) and the "aesthetically driven" trait appears on the page, but interiority remains thin and poetic rather than embodied. The custodians are present but function as witnessing chorus without individual stake. The poet's transformation from banned speaker to boundary-dissolver is asserted through lyric summary rather than dramatized contradiction or cost-laden micro-choices under pressure. No embodied emotion or therapy-speak, but the lack of visceral struggle keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilias is portrayed through consistent action and micro-choices (the plant arrangements, the reed placement), and his colorblindness shapes his perception in specific ways ("trust lives in value, shadow, pulse, and weight"). Mara's muteness and plant-language communication create genuine constraint. However, interiority remains thin—most emotional states are asserted rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure, and the apprentice and traveler function more as conduits than sources of friction. The final "awakenings barter themselves" feels more thematic echo than earned character shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell-ringer protagonist demonstrates consistent interiority through sensory particulars ("dust listens as if preparing to confess") and makes a hierarchy of values legible through the decision to let the child ring the warning bell. The character's trait of "powerfully gentle" is embodied in concrete action—striking with patience, arranging listening—rather than merely labeled. Minor slip: the director and priest of logistics remain functional foils without applying immediate pressure that forces a micro-choice with visible cost, lowering the relationship-as-crucible score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's grief and transformation arc is embodied through concrete craft choices—trembling hands, the failed plant, designing breathing chambers—but the interiority leans abstract in key beats ("listening to intervals," "host their last instructions"). The micro-choice of pulling the cord and laying the stencil shows agency, yet the mourners remain undifferentiated and passive, reducing relational pressure. The final renunciation—keeping the observatory open—feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (staying present to grief rather than unmaking the craft entirely), though the path reads more as steady deepening than contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority remains abstract and metaphor-heavy rather than embodied; "steadily curious" and "confusion itself felt like a map my grandmother left" are asserted but not shown through micro-choices under pressure. The cartomancer is vivid in gesture (skull ring tap, card shuffle) but her decisions never narrow options or foreclose a path with visible cost—she facilitates rather than drives. The arrival of people at the end feels unmotivated by prior protagonist agency; we lack the concrete stakes or internal contradiction that would make the final gathering feel earned rather than ambient.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The historian's interiority is vivid and particular, with embodied tension in lines like "hope burning my palms through the gloves." Internal conflict operates through the method itself—staggering then gliding, refusing pattern—though the peak choice to release the cages feels slightly underearned; the hoarding impulse is named but not dramatized as a live temptation with visible cost. The voice remains consistent under pressure, but the final surrender reads more as thematic fulfillment than inevitable character necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's role as "dusk noticer" is rendered through concrete ritual (shelving dreams, screening footage) with clear interiority around the shadow's yearning. The choice to inscribe the donor's name and bind the book carries visible cost—committing attention and witness—but the action feels more like fulfillment of a cataloging duty than a decision that narrows competing options. Embodied emotion is present ("I feel the weak thrum…") yet occasionally drifts into label-speak ("luminous regret"). The shadow's arc from hunger to "bound to kindness" reads as transformation, though the protagonist's own stakes remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior is richly embodied—"fragile convictions knocked like moths against the lamp"—and agency is legible in the decision to offer repair with conditions. The handler's contradictory impulses (anger braided with compassion) act simultaneously rather than alternating. Karim's confession and the narrator's final stance foreclose paths with visible cost, though Karim's interior remains largely summary. Minor backstory (debt, prior con) anchors present choice without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to "read the stories in scars" is embodied through concrete choices (examining coffee rings, touching ivy's wound, cutting the elm) that drive the arc. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between seeking closure and opening wounds, acted out rather than summarized. The fern and ivy function as relationship pressure in the single-POV frame, forcing the protagonist to negotiate consent before reclaiming the miracle. Embodied emotion is strong ("pain salts the floor with stars"), though some therapy-adjacent phrasing ("I will listen to the stories in scars") edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal gazer's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is poetically framed but remains abstract; the character executes a psychometry reading with embodied gestures ("cradle it between my palms the way a bird might incubate an egg"), yet the interiority is largely observational rather than driven by contradictory impulses or visible internal cost. The manager trembles and watches but functions as audience more than pressure source. The ending choice to harvest clear leader and thread it through the projector is legible but feels predetermined by the premise rather than earned through on-page struggle or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation to free creativity is consistent and embodied through the instrument and aurora interactions. Internal experience is vivid—"my heart hears unspoken words," the dust that "bloomed into maps behind my lids"—but theursed gift and silent communication remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The fledglings scene offers embodied emotion, yet the protagonist's micro-choices feel preordained by the dreamlike logic rather than forged through genuine internal conflict. The final renunciation ("let the instrument rest") lands as earned stasis with visible cost, but earlier beats lack the friction that would elevate characterization into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The freight guard's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—planting sparks, kneeling in sand, refusing sleep—and his oath ("to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners") drives tactical choices with visible cost (midnight freezing in his veins, dreamlessness as price). Internal contradiction appears in his wave-function dispersal versus his kneeling solidity, and the choice to remain "dreamless" to protect fragile seeds shows restraint under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract perception ("occasionally everywhere," "smear across places") that distances emotional particularity, and the final boarding feels like resumption rather than foreclosure with newly altered stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher's interiority is consistently rendered through metaphor-dense perception, but key choices feel more symbolic than psychologically motivated—choosing to whistle back the forest's sounds reads as concept-driven rather than arising from embodied contradiction. The translocation creates pressure, but the protagonist's emotional range remains narrow; grief, wonder, and hunger are named but not differentiated in texture or bodily sensation. The final turn (returning the gear to the mouth, chewing) lands as thematic gesture rather than earned psychological shift; the wildness metaphor is told ("I am the frontier") instead of shown through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Motivation clarity suffers when the quest is declared aloud to "steady my steps" yet the subsequent beats proceed on autopilot without visible internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through poetic perception ("sea sigh turning inside my ribs"), and the search for courage shapes micro-choices throughout. The dog's return is earned by the shift from chase to patience, with visible cost in the vulnerability required. However, the guides remain largely observational facilitators rather than characters with their own contradictory impulses, and the protagonist's fear is more declared than dramatized through resisted impulses in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior is richly embodied through nerve regeneration imagery and the piano bench bolt as physical-emotional anchor. The decision to reverse the bolt pitch demonstrates contradictory impulses—need for safety versus ethical refusal—acting simultaneously in scene. The bellhop is handled with care: his gestures and tremor show constraint under duty, though his arc remains observational rather than decisively transformative. Minor: the final choice feels slightly over-articulated ("safety which murders testimony") where embodied action already conveyed the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lys's motivation to unmask the pretender is declared but her interior life remains thin; we get no embodied contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure—she simply executes her plan. The pretender's final resignation ("I suppose you will keep the dust") feels unmotivated by prior interiority; he steps from shadow fully formed without prior character work. The gardener is label-only ("regally unpretentious") without choices that test the trait. Lys's agency is real but her emotional stakes never conflict with her tactics, flattening what should be a fraught unmasking into a procedural exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior life is vivid and specific ("reefs I loved taught me to count absences"), with embodied emotion and a clear arc from grief-witness to pattern-finder. The mother relationship operates subtly through the torn atlas page and the line "I keep hearing my mother's steps inside my taps"—a felt cost without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (tapping rhythms, assembling logs, writing to council) drive the revelation forward. Minor slip: the village woman interaction feels slightly ornamental, not pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and embodied through concrete actions—sighting stars, running wire, turning the crank—though the reflective passages occasionally drift toward abstraction ("thunderous serenity," "breath is the ember's ally"). Internal contradiction appears subtly in the tension between urgency and patience, and the micro-choices (trusting the hum, speaking to the city) carry visible cost. The motivation to "discover meaning" is grounded in specific tasks, but the final choice feels more like confirmation than a path-foreclosing decision with sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's interiority is richly embodied through her plant-telepathy and insurgent stance, with micro-choices (altering the sigil's angle, choosing question over command) that reveal hierarchy of values. The council confrontation near the end carries clear status dynamics and her final refusal crystallizes a renunciation with visible cost. Minor weakness: the embryo's voice ("asking who sang, asking who would choose") leans slightly diagnostic but is quickly grounded in Mara's concrete response. The change is earned through prior causality and forecloses a path (display versus stewardship).

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Samira's interiority is deeply embodied through somatic markers—freeze, tremor in belly, iron on throat—that create contradictory impulses in real time. Her pivot from the overlook to the glasshouse is earned by her reading of her own body's wisdom, and the final act of placing the photograph under the basin forecloses display while accepting ballast with visible cost. Minor slip: Theo and the chair remain functional but thinly sketched, though they apply immediate pressure without diluting focus. The core arc—survivor learning to anchor hope in bodily realism—lands with specificity and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The portrait artist's interior life is rendered through concrete imagery (hands delaying the first line, the broken box like her chest) and her micro-choices in the tower show genuine agency under pressure. The climactic untangling sequence embodies her shift from fragmentation to focus, and the final gallery vision demonstrates earned change. However, the interiority occasionally edges toward abstraction ("luminescent ache," "fragmented reality") without full embodiment, and the middle reflective passages dilute immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The albino tracker's interiority is vivid and embodied ("serene anger sits in my chest like a coiled current"), and the grief-driven motive evolves into purposeful agency. The final choice—bracing the beam in the widened moment—is earned by the prior quest and forecloses the past with visible cost ("my bones survive with a song of hairline flares"). Minor slip: the elders remain functional props without pressure-testing the protagonist's stance; relationship dynamics are absent where they could deepen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's internal conflict is embodied through concrete choices under pressure: the trembling hands, the methodical preface-stitching, the addition of their name "like a fuse." The "courage and the doubt feeding one another like wolves" is slightly abstract but redeemed by the protagonist's sequence of micro-decisions that alter tactics (testing the ping, adding receipts, pressing send). The final tea scene with the shadow crystallizes stance through shared silence rather than declaration, earning the endurance. Minor slip: "bravely conflicted" appears as a label early without immediate embodiment, though later actions justify it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator demonstrates clear interiority with embodied contradiction—she is "senselessly perceptive" and her choices consistently foreground restraint over action, creating genuine tension when her father returns demanding participation in violence. Her micro-choices (pouring dust between them, sheathing his knife, splitting the sandbag to repair the dome) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. The father's arc from bounty hunter to student of her patience is earned through on-page choices during the storm, not summary. Minor weakness: some interiority leans slightly abstract ("engraved quiet") but remains anchored in perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cool-headed fisher is established through embodied actions (slow pulse, slack face) and concrete choices (dropping the rail spike, voicing silence). Internal contradiction appears when the echo tests him "with voices he had loved" and he must transliterate them back to breath, showing genuine struggle. The motivation to return the echo for the girl is stated but not deeply pressured on the page; the fisher's competence dominates without visible mistakes that compound. The final choice to seal and return the echo feels inevitable given his skill rather than earned through a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The newsprint heiress POV is consistently realized through embodied perception ("history pricks your palm," "orbits of regret") and her micro-choices under pressure—declining coffee, placing the pen nib, drafting the statement—all flow from her devotion to truth with her father's shadow as credible friction. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between royal metaphor ("headline princess") and janitor humility, and her final choice to draft a confession forecloses the easier path of silence with felt cost. Minor slip: the technician and Kline blur slightly in the catwalk sequence, and the outreach coordinator/intern blame-shift reads more as evasion catalog than dramatized mistake, reducing the antagonist's dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist carries clear interior contradiction—gifted translator burdened by guilt over a fatal misreading—and the final tattooing of the nephew's name crystallizes agency through craft with visible cost. Interiority is consistently embodied through amber-holding, tether-tying, and breath-into-port gestures that ground emotional states. The mix of past trauma (nephew's death) and present repair task braids motivation cleanly, though the letters-from-self device edges toward convenience in late revelation. Emotional progression from haunted guilt to provisional hush reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The whimsical chalk artist POV carries a distinct perceptual signature—listening backward, reading glances as smudges—and micro-choices (drawing the spiral, placing the gate) reveal priorities. Internal texture remains consistent through metaphoric compression ("fruit of pauses," "banister" for memory). However, the narrator's socially perceptive trait is told more than dramatized in pressure; we see observation but few contradictory impulses forcing costly trade-offs. The closure moment (pressing the flake back, walking out with "lilac unease… a forecast worth heeding") registers as acceptance but the cost feels ambient rather than a specific forfeiture tied to prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is distinctive and layered—"warm coldness" as restraint, the oath to "aberrant mercy"—and embodied through the tessera handling and the fraught exchange with the patrol leader. Internal contradiction surfaces when the narrator must rename danger to save lives, balancing radical mercy against the leader's title-heavy hunger. The final choice to show steel arms and speak gently earns the stand-down without convenience. Minor slip: the leader's recognition of his mother's fig story feels slightly rushed, but the cost—exposing the narrator's augmented body and oath—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost narrator demonstrates consistent interior texture through synesthetic perception and purposeful micro-choices (flipping the coin, coaxing echoes, rehearsing with pears). The motivation to help Rowan is clear and embodied through concrete actions rather than abstract desire. Rowan's arc from despair to renewed agency is earned through the discovery sequence, though her interiority remains thin—we see her tears and cracked hands but little contradictory impulse. The ghost's renunciation (leaving the coin, drifting back) carries visible cost and forecloses direct intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied—"the feathered edges of other minds, rasping against mine"—and the microflinches and somatic markers ground the pill's effect. Mara functions as affectionate skeptic and anchor, applying immediate pressure through her consent-framed participation. The move from swallowing pills to "learning to listen with craft" is earned through the choreographed experiment and the grounding coil discovery. Minor slip: the recall notice lands as convenient setup rather than a live complication the protagonist must navigate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's sensory-mapping vocation is embodied through specific micro-choices (floating to ease joints, pressing the fossil to the wall, threading the chord through dream servers). Interiority is concrete and particular ("the limbic heat spikes," "the headband floods red and gold"), anchored in both professional idiom and embodied perception. The final choice to feed the chord into the sleepers' dream loops carries visible cost—the protagonist sits alone, logging "only half of the truth"—yet the renunciation feels earned by prior pressure. Minor repetition of "the fossil" and "the map" stems across beats prevents entry to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hourglass turner's interior life is rendered through specific sensory choices—"honeyed" light, "unearthed silence"—and the progression from curious kid to caretaker is grounded in concrete action (cataloging buttons, unsealing the echo). The motive to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" drives micro-choices throughout, particularly the decision to ring the bell and involve the town. However, the collective "we" in the final third dilutes individual psychological pressure; the protagonist's internal contradictions flatten once the community joins, and the emotional stakes of leading others into uncertain terrain receive only gestural treatment ("wary"). The ending's collective action forecloses solo rebellion with visible cost, but the felt weight of that choice—what the turner personally risks or renounces—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The burned spy's motivations are clear and embodied through physical markers (scars, the pillbox), micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, writing codes), and the renunciation/late-truth backstory that drives present action. Internal contradiction appears in "prudently daring" and the tension between early courage and late truth. The mysterious stranger's sudden appearance and minimal pushback feel convenient; his role as exposition vessel weakens interactivity. Mina exists only in reflection, but her influence constrains present choices and the pillbox becomes a tactical object, so the reflection anchors adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive and embodied through concrete actions (withdrawing the needle, trembling hands that still hold the stitch). The journey from paralyzed accumulation to decisive simplification is earned through micro-choices at the ford. The coachman remains observant rather than fully developed, but his function as catalyst is clear. Minor deduction: the bride remains abstract, a destination rather than a presence that complicates choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The potter protagonist is rendered through distinct perceptual filters ("slow enough to hear clay explaining itself") and embodied ritual ("fingers steady, my breath slow"), but motivation remains largely contemplative observation rather than high-stakes choice. The tests with slip and dust are micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy, yet they carry minimal personal cost—the windbreak's leaf and moth's trust feel more like confirmation than consequence. Internal contradiction is absent; the narrator moves through discovery without competing impulses that would deepen pressure. Azra functions as historical presence rather than on-page pressure, limiting relationship crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior life is textured and embodied—"wistfully pragmatic" drives micro-choices, and the father's memory anchors present action without summaries. Contradictory impulses surface when the protagonist guards hope yet leaves it for others to trip over, showing complexity. The final choice to install the light is earned through prior beats (waiting for the petal, retrieving the tooth, nudging the mesh), and the cost is legible: vulnerability exposed on the roof, inheritance risked. Minor slips: some emotional states are labeled rather than dramatized under peak stress, and secondary characters remain functional but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's stance ("contemporary of extinct species") reads as conceptual claim rather than lived trait; interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("taste of emotion felt sapped by the salt of persistence") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The vow to "coexist without pretending they were still here" offers a stance shift, but prior choices remain sparse—turning the sundial and walking aisles are gestures, not pressure-tested decisions that foreclose paths. Motivation is articulated late and resolved through declaration rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is lyric and specific ("my words knew the road and my heart did not"), with embodied emotion through gesture and spatial movement. The shift from passive keeper to active installation-builder shows earned agency with visible cost: the public exposure of private longing. Minor slip: the woman's dust-in-hair detail feels slightly convenient as a mirror, and her silent complicity lacks friction that would deepen the reconciliation stake.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's professional interiority (charts, synthesis rack, frequency knowledge) is specific and embodied through repeated micro-choices—opening the gate valve, recruiting allies, patching the bay—each foreclosing options under pressure. Internal conflict registers in "cautiously hopeful" balanced against cosmic manipulation, and the final choice to hand the provost headphones shows contradiction (nodding to power while subverting it). However, the tricksters remain abstract antagonists without individual traits, and secondary cast (bass player, acoustics grad, custodian) lack distinct voices or conflicting agendas; they function as textured extensions of the narrator's will. Emotional progression reads as steady resolve rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, capping upward movement.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's interiority is distinctly textured through embodied claustrophobia ("my lungs took careful, measured sips") and the compass-point as both grandmother's legacy and tactical tool. Internal conflict between prudence and trespass drives micro-choices (choosing the hour, measuring breath, calibrating organ keys). The grandmother's presence charges motivation without becoming expository, and the final promise to return with music shows earned restraint rather than false resolution. Minor slip: some reflection edges toward abstraction ("Forgiveness, I learned, is another word for lingering") but recovers quickly through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lio's prosopagnosia drives a distinct perceptual signature—mapping voices, gaits, grief temperatures—that shapes his investigative method throughout. The captain's motivations arrive through dramatized breath patterns and body language rather than exposition, and the final choice (sitting, holding his wrists, confessing) is earned by Lio's methodical pressure. Internal contradiction appears when Lio "does not forgive and does not condemn" yet engineers confession through portraiture, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the captain's arc compresses rapidly in the final third, and his pivot from denial to confession could have been spread across one additional beat to deepen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's contradictory impulses—"idealistic map librarian" as "less like a weakness and more like a duty," the desire to return versus staying "one more cycle"—create genuine internal tension. Embodied emotion appears in thumb-polished nail, dampness climbing sleeves, holding the nail tighter. The final choice to stay and complete Seraphine's map earns its weight through the journals/nail causality chain, though the stakes of "reversible exile" remain somewhat abstract until Mirek's warning. Minor deduction for "nervously confident heart librarians cultivate" reading as diagnostic rather than dramatized contradiction in a pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently observant and embodied ("I feel luminous disbelief ribbon through my ribs"), but motivation remains abstract—"sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" reads as label rather than dramatized want. The hitchhiker and fiddler lack distinct internal contradiction; their roles feel archetypal rather than psychologically specific. The final choice to leave the flake is offered without visible cost or friction, reading more as ritual than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("years polishing calm until it shone"), with embodied contradiction between the inherited criminal legacy and the tech-entrepreneur present. The father's loops versus the startup's geofencing creates a strong internal conflict that drives the ending choice to scatter bills at the train. Minor slip: the courier incident and cofounder's "reputational gravity" line feel slightly under-dramatized for the weight they carry in the collapse sequence, but the core arc of circular inheritance to acceptance lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority shows authentic texture through lucid-dream chronicler vocabulary ("midnight solace," "breath letter") and embodied grief work. Micro-choices appear—opening the ledger, asking Mara to describe the stone—but the peak emotional moment ("I told her that witnessing did not pin her to the past, it braided her breath with mine for the climb") reads as diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Mara's arc from silence to speech is earned, though her brother's death arrives through exposition rather than dramatized memory that alters present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Issa's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout: "She tastes bile and iron, and then she steadies herself as if setting spear to shield." Her micro-choices under pressure are clear—kneeling, pricking her palm, loosening the rings—each action rooted in warlike discipline and earned by the teacher's betrayal. The backstory about Master Ren integrates well, anchoring her present stance without flattening momentum. Minor slip: the phrase "room inside her armor" in the penultimate beat reads slightly abstract for peak emotional clarity, but does not undercut the earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious"), and embodied emotion operates throughout ("anxious elation," "trembling joy paced by fear"). However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstract self-description and symbolic merging rather than contradictory impulses creating visible friction in concrete choices. The covenant's completion reads more as mystical fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a path with legible emotional cost, and the girl's sudden appearance lacks sufficient grounding to create relational pressure that tests the narrator's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("patch holes in the soul") is established early and drives the catacomb journey, but the character remains more archetype than individual—"reckless idealist, fiercely gentle" functions as label rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's traded future provides backstory weight, yet his presence as "laugh stumble like a foal" then "laugh ran clear" feels more symbolic than causally earned through on-page struggle. Micro-choices (kneeling to soothe roots, scribing on bone) advance the goal, but the final regraft succeeds without visible cost beyond accepting scars—a declared rather than dramatized price. Internal conflict between courage and craft is stated but not shown as simultaneous competing impulses in a single high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through tactile detail (grille cloth prickling thumb, grease on knuckles) and the contradiction between professional appraisal facts and emotional wounds remains active throughout. The "insulating emotionally with facts" method creates genuine internal conflict as the narrator calibrates each observation against shame. Minor slips: "calibrated by years on the road" edges toward summary, and the final turn ("not to redeem my name, but to discover purpose") articulates rather than dramatizes the shift. The cost of examining Abel's artifact is felt through specific sensory anchors and the letter opening "Dear Echo."

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator possesses a distinct perceptual signature—mapping cuneiform to magnetic fields, measuring transitions through "wedges" and "gradients"—with embodied choices (kneeling, humming calibration, rotating rails by a fingerwidth) that reveal methodical craft under pressure. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: haunted ambitions seek mastery yet the protagonist learns to "tune" rather than "reverse," a renunciation earned through contact with the seed and mentor's trace. The final shift from rescue to commons-building forecloses the mastery path with visible cost (accepting the mentor's absence, committing to collective listening). Minor weakness: the mentor remains abstract; her vanishing supplies motive but no on-page friction that tests the narrator's present loyalty or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The titan-gear librarian POV is internally consistent with a distinct perceptual signature—listening, cataloguing contradictions, smelting names—but remains primarily reactive rather than decisively choosing under pressure. The baker and boy arrive, are catalogued, and leave; the librarian's micro-choices (placing parcels in the creel, smelting alloys) serve others' arcs without visible cost to the librarian's own stakes. Interiority is poetic and embodied ("my gears tick with their dust") but the protagonist's deeper internal conflict or renunciation is implied rather than dramatized with a forecloses-a-path moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inspector's interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory attention ("lantern low," the pearl "warm from my skin"), and the final choice to crown the stalagmite emerges from established values ("listening for the latent radiance"). However, the protagonist operates largely alone with minimal dramatic resistance; the "tug of old doctrine" arrives in a single line without prior friction, and the decision feels more meditative than tested. Internal contradiction is present but not layered under simultaneous pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's guilt-driven motivation is embodied through concrete micro-choices (clearing the clog "one twig, one rag, one stone at a time") and the interiority is character-particular ("I sketched beauty where a warning belonged"). Internal contradiction operates throughout: the impulse to romanticize versus the discipline to "write toward self-forgiveness by doing the unglamorous maintenance." The final renunciation—carrying the chord until "it is not yours alone"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of solitary absolution with visible cost. Minor: the phrase "daringly methodical" reads slightly label-heavy when first introduced, though it's later dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking the library through measured presence. Interior experience is specific ("cautious exuberance," "heart tame and wild at once") and contradictory impulses appear in scene. However, the final choice to write the second letter feels under-earned; the protagonist's agency at closure reads more as following a revealed pattern than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward poetic abstraction in peak moments rather than visceral particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"hands practiced at weighing evidence and a heart trained to pretend" establishes her professional-emotional split early. Her internal conflict between empire complicity and ethical obligation drives the climactic choice to play and melt the violin. Embodiment is strong ("mulberry ache, a bruised scent that catches in the hinge of breath"), and the telepathic-plant trait generates micro-choices (consulting jasmine, reading coffee stains) that alter present stance. Minor slip: the director's brief appearance at the end feels underdeveloped; his "frowns like weather learning itself" is evocative but his presence doesn't meaningfully pressure the protagonist's already-completed act.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"I felt the stone listening to me back," the emerald's warmth against her palm. The mother's teaching ("our calling was not decoration but return") roots motivation in lived apprenticeship. The final choice to "stand, lucidly watchful" represents earned endurance rather than transformation, which fits the piece's Accumulative/Textural design. Minor issue: the emotional texture remains steady rather than contradictory under peak pressure, and the reflection-heavy mode occasionally abstracts rather than dramatizes ("I recognized my duty renewed").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and textured—soil under nails, the hairpin as both wound and tool—and the internal contradiction between forgiveness and grief accumulates through action. However, the piece skews heavily toward reflective summary rather than present-moment contradiction under pressure; key choices (forgiving the mother, arriving at the grotto, choosing which vines to prune) are recounted rather than dramatized. The final act with the hairpin and tendril is concrete and embodied, but it arrives after extensive meditation that flattens urgency. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the lack of on-page struggle or mistake in the present frame limits the felt cost of any single decision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is embodied through micro-choices ("her throat moves when futures test their weight") and the physical cloak of doubt provides a tactile extension of her interior state. The contradiction between her "sincerely insincere" smile and her nights of watching "maps turn neighborhoods into numbers" reveals genuine internal conflict. The final choice to sign with conditions is earned by the night-long wind-chime work and the narrator's process, showing alteration with visible cost. Minor deduction: the narrator remains more observer than agent with decisive choices, though the method itself creates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The researcher's backward aging is rendered through concrete physical detail ("gray gone to chestnut," "eyes were older"), and the narrator's choices to watch and wait are motivated by trust established early. The final vanishing carries embodied weight. However, the narrator remains largely reactive; interior contradiction is minimal, and the researcher's motivations are told rather than shown through conflicting on-page micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior world is richly textured through embodied metaphor ("letting their decays and overlaps sketch out distances") and the physicality of listening. The grandmother's presence provides specific emotional grounding. However, the piece relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the narrator's resolve remains largely static, with no visible struggle between competing wants. The final choice to "seat myself again" feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied contradictions like "I felt small, uncredentialed, and truer than the weeks I had rented cleverness from machines." The unstrapping moment dramatizes internal conflict through physical action with visible cost. Backstory fragments (grandmother's teaching, city memories) anchor in present stimuli and tilt stance via micro-choices. Minor slip: the keystone interaction lacks sufficient resistance to fully earn the final shift, though the renunciation of assistive charms provides credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—"quiet hunger was to discover the color of sound" anchors motivation in sensory specificity. The arc from hiding behind truth to "truth was no longer a wall but an open door" is earned through the underwater experience, though the final shift feels slightly hasty. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the tag "singing in my palm"), but much of the transformation occurs through poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The foreman's observation about hiding provides useful external pressure, but the protagonist's internal struggle remains largely reflective rather than conflicted in action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's role as "cast lots decision maker" is clear and specific, with embodied detail (coins clicking, breathing rituals). Interior contradiction appears in "quietly enthusiastic even as doubt flowers" and "stellar doubt keeps one finger on my heart," showing simultaneous impulses. The final choice—to sing a patient hello rather than other options—is earned by the coin pattern and carries visible cost (distilling last drops, trusting pattern over certainty). Minor weakness: some interiority leans abstract ("wavelength align with purpose") rather than concrete sensation, and the change reads more as ritual completion than profound transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reaper's interiority is dense and specific—grief embodied through the prism work, naming acts, and the snowfield memory—all showing contradictory impulses (duty versus mending distance). Motivation evolves from failure to cautious repair through micro-choices (writing "Not Leaving," then "Named"). The final naming of "Enough" earns its cost by prior causality. Minor: the voice occasionally edges toward abstract philosophizing ("fog makes cliffs feel taller") but recovers through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Nera's "earnestly naive" devotion and shift from "brittle devotion to their starched logic" to embodied action with the bell shows clear internal contradiction and growth. Her micro-choices—counting drops, aligning the crack, rubbing water along the seam—are concrete and embodied. Aro's arc from "fingers smelling of rope and apology" to choking laughter and promising restraint is credible. Minor strain: Nera's epiphany about "tepid feels like the one temperature water never resists" borders on self-aware articulation, but the metaphor stays rooted in her magic's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is grounded in embodied perception—kneeling to lift the label, standing with shadow—and the discovery of Ruth's identity creates genuine internal pressure. The shift from badge-enforcement to memorial-keeper shows contradictory impulses in scene ("the badge sits on a heart that still hears the chime"). However, the white-haired woman's arrival feels convenient, and the protagonist's internal conflict resolves too smoothly without visible cost to professional standing or personal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's interior is established through concrete actions (collecting petals in vials, adjusting the brazier) and embodied choices that reflect her discipline-versus-sentiment tension. The mother memory adds depth to her sentimental trait without therapy-speak. However, her transformation question "When does a mixture become a self" remains abstract and never concretizes into an on-page behavioral dilemma with visible cost. The final choice to wait rather than force the transformation reads more as passive deferral than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied: "my stomach becomes the canopy" anchors visceral fear without label-speak. Micro-choices under pressure—pacing words to breath, revising signals when Lio refuses—demonstrate contradictory impulses (command vs. care) that shape the crisis. The mentor's blindfold training and the watcher's erasure of self establish a consistent character arc that earns the final stance. Minor: the relationship with Lio is told more than tested on the page until the crisis, and the "defiance of relief" hug feels slightly performed rather than contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kana's internal journey from numbness to feeling is established, but the interiority relies heavily on metaphoric abstraction ("snowblind calm," "tidal alphabet") rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices—placing palms on glass, counting until memory settles—are present but read as ritualistic rather than conflicted. The clones remain undifferentiated except for Ori, whose fan kata is elegant but doesn't demonstrate internal tension or individual stakes beyond symbolic opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conductor's interior voice is vivid and particular ("urgency tastes like rain"), with contradictory impulses embodied through the devotion/eagerness paradox. Emotions are well-embodied in specific gestures (stroking pull cords "as one strokes a horse"). However, the protagonist remains more cipher than character—no genuine internal conflict emerges, and the work proceeds without visible struggle or cost-driven choice that forecloses a path. The ending renunciation ("I take nothing but the unspoken, and I only borrow that") reads as stated principle rather than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist demonstrates coherent motivation—seeking friendship with uncertainty after certainty broke them—and the guardian's "dimensional homesickness" is embodied through his conflicted watchfulness. Interior states are mostly concrete ("Every breath filled with glittering needles"), though the final renunciation ("love sometimes means not crossing a line") edges toward platitude. The waiting-as-choice sequence earns the protagonist's shift from seeker to companion, foreclosing the crossing with visible restraint. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("make friends with uncertainty") that risks label-speak, though the piece dramatizes it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and his methodical, sensitive approach is embodied through concrete actions (scraping filings, adjusting bellows, bleeding into the mix). Internal contradiction appears in "stoically sensitive" and "joy hurt," but these remain somewhat labeled rather than fully dramatized in simultaneous action. The final choice to plant the crozier and return tomorrow feels earned by the successive-approximation pattern, though the bishop's men's sudden shift ("some of their prayers learned how to ask") lacks granular causality—we don't see what micro-choice or gesture triggered their change. The cost is present (loss as "currency of renewal") but slightly abstract at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear motivation rooted in mentor's legacy, with embodied choices (building the coupling, aiming the horn). Internal contradiction appears when discarding assumptions while also clinging to mentor's method. The shift from searcher to carrier of beginnings is earned through the tuning sequence and the cave's response. Minor deduction: Sela's interior remains thin, serving primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concretely embodied through occupation-specific detail ("trained by tides and ticket stubs") and the choice to become "the hinge" is earned through prior longing and presented with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between hope and fear, embodied in the lifejacket metaphor. The final transformation—"feet thin into wake, my heart stretch into rope"—shows genuine renunciation that forecloses the protagonist's own arrival, though the lyric register occasionally abstracts emotional specificity ("resiliently positive" reads as a label applied rather than dramatized contradiction).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is distinctly rendered through architecture-as-loneliness metaphors and the specific memory of telling her lover "math was kinder than people." The decision to step into the rigging herself and confront the phantom witness shows agency under pressure. However, the realization that "geometry never protected her" arrives as clean epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path with felt cost—she simply "asks whether love might also be provable," which reads as insight without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The navigation instructor's motivation is clear and specific—learning to navigate by starlight from beneath the sea—and drives consistent choices throughout. Interiority is embodied through concrete details (the chain link as anchor for "shaking thoughts," Inea breathing "as if she will break"). The instructor's petition to the council and the careful weeks of practice show agency under pressure. However, the emotional progression remains somewhat steady rather than contradictory; the instructor's resolve never wavers or fragments under the weight of risk, missing the layered complexity that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct (the hearing aid as sensory filter, curiosity driving attendance) and embodied choices shape the climax—sitting within arm's reach, sliding the photograph, calling witnesses into purpose. Eli's internal state is less developed; his voice-in-pulse receives label treatment ("debt he cannot pay") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation (pocketing the photograph, accepting the borrowed heart's counsel) feels earned by prior causality but lacks visible struggle at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivo's interiority is concrete and character-particular: his claustrophobia is embodied through breath-counting and the caves' pressure on his ribs, and his devotion to Ada and Sorel is dramatized through ritual (mugs, names spoken aloud). The micro-choices—waiting for tidal slack, chilling then warming housings, refusing to export—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when fear "lined itself up behind duty and followed like a trained dog," showing struggle without resolution into tidy stages. Minor slip: Ada and Sorel remain vivid through their skills but lack on-page pressure to test Ivo's choices directly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation ("fetch wisdom from failure") and heartbeat-counting trait are present but largely decorative; the internal arc relies on telling rather than micro-choices under pressure. The ghost companion offers some interaction, yet the dialogue feels more like thematic echo than character-specific conflict ("remember me as something more than interference"). The death-certificate survivor backstory is recounted but never constrains present action—no visible trade-off or complication emerges from the error. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("counts tree rings and grief") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller has a distinct conceptual texture but lacks moment-to-moment embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction appears only as poetic declaration ("one hand for the bones, one for the birds, one for my heart") rather than simultaneous conflicting impulses dramatized in scene. The curse's appetite and the giving-away of private names register as told symbolic cost rather than foregrounded micro-choices with visible consequences that alter later tactics. Interiority often describes states in elevated diction ("the promise had settled in me like a quiet bruise") without grounding them in physical sensation or on-page micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete objects (arrowhead, phone) and physical action (scraping flint to willow). Interior voice maintains specificity ("do not anthropomorphize rocks" self-talk), though the backstory about Marko—while anchored in present grief—occupies substantial text without altering present choices until the final pun moment. The metamorphosis at closure (vow replacing cover) reads as earned stance-shift, but the protagonist's agency leans observational through much of the middle, with pressure supplied more by the cryptid's dialogue than by protagonist micro-choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The violinist protagonist demonstrates clear motivation and makes agency-driven choices (stopping performance to signal through music, using the locust shell, confronting the mechanical city). Interiority is often concrete ("I tuned my heartbeat by memory, thinking of the first crush of hail on tin roofs") and the final choice to continue playing tomorrow is earned through on-page pressure. However, the piece leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—the protagonist's internal conflict between sanctioned performance and rebellion is declared more than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously. The statues' transformation feels more metaphorical than psychologically grounded, and some beats read as thesis illustration rather than character-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mailman's interiority is concrete and embodied through selective perception filtered by occupation and family history ("my mother, who listened to weather"). Motivation intensifies across the arc, from routine delivery through measured escalation to the charged final gathering. The micro-choices under pressure—unsealing the storm, trading lists with the guide, maintaining courteous defiance—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Minor slip: the boy's quiet dignity and the woman's blue ledger lean slightly toward symbolic type rather than idiosyncratic behavior, but the narrator's texture remains consistent and the closure choice is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carpenter's interiority remains consistent—patient, interpretive, driven by the promise to "interpret silence as possibility"—and his embodied micro-choices (reaching without ripples, tightening screws, breathing a note) accumulate toward the ending. However, motivation is delivered primarily through reflective summary ("He had promised himself...," "He remembered the last rider...") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final choice (singing the carousel awake) lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; the carousel responds obligingly. The lack of on-page stakes friction or renunciation caps Q1 below 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian's interiority is distinctly embodied ("I tidy chalk, refill fountain pens," "the scarf tugged") and motivations are clear—seeking "the place where stories live" through concrete action. Internal contradiction appears in observed solitude balanced against patron presence, and the choice to "shelve the air" demonstrates agency under pressure. Minor deduction: the predecessor's voice sometimes merges with the narrator's reflective register, and the final return to desk duty, while thematically resonant, could show more visible cost in the choice itself.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator possesses a distinct perceptual signature—"odd-hour librarian," handling the watercolor palette with deliberate ritual—and internal contradictions emerge in the tension between cataloging (control) and porosity (release). The final choice to leave the door unlatched is motivated by prior beats, though Aria's presence operates more as luminous absence than embodied pressure. Interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("cipher of longing," "amplitude of morning") that abstracts rather than grounds emotion. The renunciation is earned but the cost reads more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's motivations remain legible—he performs his craft with patience and precision—but interiority is thin; we witness his actions without access to contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The scholar's desire to free a trapped kindness is established through backstory (the sister's ribbon), yet the peak choice (taking the curl on his tongue) reads more as ritual than a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Embodiment is present in gestures ("brushed it across the keyhole," "knelt, putting his ear to the grain") but emotional conflict is told rather than dramatized through simultaneous competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The folklorist protagonist exhibits clear interiority rooted in professional identity and personal history. Embodied emotion appears in "pilgrim's ache," breath management as a survival reflex, and the tactile engagement with the fairy ring. The final gesture—bowing to settle the debt—forecloses the wrong-name bargain with visible cost (she now knows "which promises to keep this time"), and the shadow motif tracks a persistent internal contradiction. Minor slip: some introspection verges on label-speak ("chronically curious," "pretending not to hope") without full embodiment in micro-choices under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist's interiority is concrete and particular ("reflections were the only survivors that remembered me without pity"), with embodied choices under pressure (walking backward, annotating with charcoal). The girl's motivation to rescue her brother is established through specific action (carrying the jar, matching the narrator's backward pace). Internal contradiction is present in the archivist's simultaneous authority and exile, though the final choice to mentor rather than claim heroism could have been more viscerally conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pruner's interiority is heavily abstract—"branches speak in hues the throat cannot carry"—relying on lyric assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The charge "to preserve the color of wonder" drives action, but micro-choices lack visible internal conflict; the protagonist moves through beats with near-omniscient certainty. The creative attribute is mentioned ("insatiably creative") but never constrains a choice or creates friction. Emotional progression is poetic but flat; no micro-hesitation or competing impulse dramatizes cost at the key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The restorer's motivation is established early (grounding restless spirits) and the work with the daughter shows purposeful micro-choices. Interiority is concrete in moments like "my secret is that I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones," grounding the character's investment. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; key decisions (what to do with the coffer, how to work the net) feel procedural rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The daughter's arc is clearer—she trembles, holds the knot, repeats the name—but the restorer's internal stakes never sharpen into a felt dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The map framer's perceptive, methodically curious nature is embodied through specific micro-choices: pressing the salt-warped map, waiting by the panel, counting breaths to match the henge stones. Interior contradictions emerge in the tension between professional distance ("shielded openness") and personal investment in the chapel's discovery. The final choice to leave the panel unsealed rather than secure it demonstrates earned stance crystallization with visible cost—professional protocol sacrificed for the chapel's breathing autonomy. Minor weakness: some reflection tilts abstract ("my reason for this work has always been") without immediate grounding in present stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinct—"grief made its proofs in salt and pressure," the work of untangling wires calms interior noise—and the final choice to release the snow globe is earned by the accumulated weight of the transmission and the child's stub. Embodied contradictions appear: the narrator claims analytic detachment yet seeks absolution, performs meticulous archival work yet releases the evidence. The relationship with Malik remains functional but thin, applying minimal pressure. Minor slip: "first name basis with death" reads as a label rather than a dramatized stance until the coffee-dreams line retrospectively anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The balladeer's interiority is consistently embodied through specific craft actions (clipping leads, encoding patterns) and the motivation to serve unspoken community needs creates a coherent through-line. However, internal contradiction is thin—the protagonist encounters no genuine dilemma or competing impulse that would complicate the encoding task. The ghost's reply and the protagonist's closing question gesture toward stakes, but no on-page choice forces a visible trade-off or forecloses a path with felt cost. The balladeer observes, encodes, and descends without a pivot that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout—"affectionate detachment...the way a lantern warms a cabin without singeing the maps" anchors their role and contradictory impulses. The choice to read the diary despite "guilty tremor" and the final act of placing both goggles and diary in the forgetter room demonstrates internal conflict dramatized through action. The emotional arc from curiosity through understanding to witnessed grief is embodied rather than labeled, and the servant's renunciation of deeper engagement ("limits and with ringing, and with a vow to turn away") forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor demerit: the relationship to Madam Vire is filtered entirely through reflection rather than direct interaction, which slightly reduces pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is strongly embodied through meteorological perception and grief-driven micro-choices (categorizing clouds, tying the line to absence). The motivation to prove empty spaces remember drives consistent action across beats. Minor deduction: the deceased "you" remains somewhat abstract—a collection of gestures (laughing, carrying string) rather than a fully contradictory presence whose loss reshapes specific beliefs. The final choice to wind the ribbon is earned by prior causality with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's face blindness creates a coherent perceptual filter—they misplace people but never boundaries—and drives the choice to paint sky-maps as a way to hold what they cannot recognize in faces. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between not saving the building yet giving it a knowable face. The father memory ("I never saw my father's face after the accident; it became a blank noon") feels slightly inserted rather than woven through pressure, but the vow to mirror sky for strangers grows organically from that loss. Micro-choices (whispering names, fixing gold dust where the rubbing directs) are present but carry minimal visible cost until the final note is left.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is consistently particular—speaking to rivets, translating wind tones—and interior texture remains stable through figurative density. Motivation (charting discovery "the way a baker wants bread to rise") is concrete and drives the phrasebook interpretation. However, the final choice to "fold" the luminance feels more thematic ceremony than a decision with visible cost; the narrator never faces a competing want or meaningful trade-off that would foreclose a path. Competence is unbalanced: the apprentice solves every puzzle (hopscotch angles, murmuration arithmetic, multi-lingual hum) without friction, flattening the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The locksmith's internal state is rendered through specific sensory anchors (chafed palms, cold steadying breath) and his actions demonstrate purposeful expertise rather than generic competence. His motivation to learn "the rhythm of repair" drives choices at each step, and the final instruction he leaves is earned by the work shown. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract—terms like "the art of teaching a hurt how to keep moving" read as thematic gloss rather than embodied contradiction, and we never see him genuinely struggle or make a mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The collective "we" narrator maintains a stable stance with consistent perceptual filters (orchard imagery, texture of survival). Ana's moment holding the bell offers embodied specificity, but most other characters remain undifferentiated from the choral voice. The piece lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values; the community moves as one without friction. Motivation is declared ("strangely trustworthy") rather than earned through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The adjuster's motivation is coherent and the puppet-as-companion device provides embodied emotion, but the interiority remains largely atmospheric and abstract ("bruised awe") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene. The choice at closure—to turn the key and grant reprieve—lacks a live alternative or visible cost that forecloses a path; the action reads as ritual repetition rather than a decision under pressure. Micro-choices like lifting the puppet or humming the tune add texture but do not alter tactics or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The caretaker is internally consistent—driven by debt and resentment, yet compelled to guide. Contradictory impulses appear simultaneously: "I resented it the way rust resents salt, swelling, bright, inevitable, and strangely clean." The grandmother backstory anchors method without derailing present pressure. Embodied reaction under stress ("rolled it in my palm") and the final renunciation (pressing the nut into another's hand while advising against blueprint-knowledge) earn the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's grief, guilt, and desire to reconnect with her brother are embodied and drive micro-choices throughout—her pocket chrysalis, her decision to build the bridge, her apology. Internal contradiction appears when she intellectualizes relationships as reactions to filter, then recognizes the error on the page. The brother remains underdeveloped; his thumbs-up icon and single scene limit relational pressure. Motivation coheres and the final choice—catching his elbow, releasing the chrysalis—feels earned, though the brother's forgiveness arrives quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vendor protagonist demonstrates clear interiority through transactions with moonlight and measured absence, with micro-choices visible in the act of "quantifying absence" and trading silences. The first customer's page-scar and chapter-parole setup create embodied stakes, and the protagonist's final self-incision earns the closure moment. However, the attribute "mindfully scattered" remains label-only without constraining action, and the internal contradiction between vending and seeking origin never generates visible friction or costly mistakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chef-protagonist possesses a distinctive perceptual signature (tasting memories) that filters choices and embodied experience throughout. Interiority remains concrete and particular—"my jaw clenched to keep it contained," "gratitude is a river that floods the banks at touch"—with emotion consistently embodied rather than labeled. The arc from isolation ("I wrapped my hands") to communal touch without storm is earned through the broth-making choice and visible cost (absorbing the city's grief). Minor deduction: secondary characters (boy, castellan) apply pressure but remain functional rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's characterization is established through lyric gesture—hands smelling of brass, voice folding a room—but her internal contradictions and embodied struggle remain thin. The "empathetically decisive" label is invoked rather than dramatized through simultaneous conflicting impulses. Her choices to climb, lower the weight, and signal the choir advance the plot but lack visceral cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path on the page. The councilman's swift conversion ("he nodded once, twice, tres veces") skips the friction that would test Mara's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interior voice shows distinct perceptual texture ("helix-minded engineer") and embodied grief, with micro-choices visible in the canyon apparatus assembly. The relationship with Mira is rendered through memory and artifact rather than direct interaction, which limits immediate pressure but supports the accumulative design. Internal contradiction appears in the calibration argument memory, showing want versus caution. The final vow to "modify our future by refusing to fossilize the living" earns modest cost through renunciation, though the choice remains largely cognitive rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archivist's motivation to recover forgotten combinations is clear and drives the journey, with embodied details like "pressed my boots to the ceiling" and "tucked the folio inside my jacket." However, interiority remains abstract—phrases like "prism-minded" and "latent blaze" function as labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to return is stated rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost. No secondary character pressure tests the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tree-song sculptor's interiority is rendered through embodied perception ("pressed my ear to bark and felt empathy in motion") and micro-choices (when the hedgehog nods, permission is felt to continue). Motivation is consistent—creating music in a silent world—and the character's choice to match the insulator's refusal to hurry shows a values hierarchy. Internal contradiction is minimal; the protagonist displays patient conviction without complication. Backstory is substantial (~20%) but anchored to present stimuli (studying ruins informs current tuning practice) and tilts present stance, meeting BRR expanded-mode tests.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The exiled tutor is embodied through the basalt worry stone habit and the memory of prior failure ("trusting speed"), and the student's silent understanding creates a working dynamic. However, the protagonist's choices at key moments read more as ritualized procedure than urgent internal conflict—the "thoughtfully precise" trait constrains method but doesn't force a visible tradeoff between competing impulses. The exile backstory anchors motive but remains summary; the final king-tipping gesture is legible but feels ceremonial rather than a hard-won renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's "eclectic pacifist" stance is established early through voice and project description, but interiority remains abstract—relying on theatrical declarations ("my hands tremble like stage curtains") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice to use resonance rather than force is more poetic principle than a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get metaphorical gestures but no visceral pressure that forces a hierarchy of values into legible collision.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her herbalist skills are demonstrated through concrete choices (placing the flower on the swaying platform, positioning cedar baskets). Her interior access is consistent and olfactory focus creates a distinct perceptual signature. However, the character's journey lacks meaningful internal contradiction—she remains steadfast throughout without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the ending delivers serenity without visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception ("my chest feels hollow as gourds," the tip "warms when the arches hum"), and her micro-choices under pressure—launching at the right moment, fitting the arrow tip to the wound—are motivated by her inherited legacy and drive to restore resilience. The mother's bequest (clasp and arrow tip) functions as both motive anchor and constraint that shapes the climactic action. Minor deduction: the protagonist's competence is high throughout with little struggle or mistake that compounds before resolution, slightly flattening the arc of genuine difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator's interiority is consistent and specific—meticulous, professionally distanced, shaped by forensic training. Motivation is clear (cultivating foresight after a fatal convergence), and micro-choices (pocketing the patch, mapping eddies, drafting the grid order) reveal values under pressure. The final stance is earned: the investigator moves from documenting to prescribing, transforming singular convergence from trap to safer habit. Minor: the investigator remains largely unopposed internally; competence is high, struggle felt but not deeply contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's interior is densely rendered through synesthetic perception, but motivation remains abstract—"certify wonder as essential" is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The choice to ring bells and unfetter the hush reads as fulfillment of an assigned role rather than a decision under competing pressures. Embodied contradiction is present in "oscillating repose" and the tension between sleep and vigilance, yet the final act feels ceremonial rather than earned by prior internal conflict. The council's demand and the protagonist's compliance lack friction that would reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life shows genuine contradiction—wanting to "harvest insights from failure" while staging a solitary ritual that might be self-punishment. Embodied emotion appears in the breath-holding quiet and the careful arrangement of markers, though some reflection ("I remember the cost of bravado") tilts toward summary. The final choice to "cross tomorrow, not to claim, but to witness" is earned by the flute-playing scene and the encounter with the twin-valley self, and the cost is visible: the protagonist relinquishes ownership in favor of patient witness. Minor issue: some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("hunger to patience") that slightly dilutes specificity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is present—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—but remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The operator is described through borrowed traits and mythic claims ("eyes, full of lucid turbulence") without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final exchange ("He returned my laugh, and I returned a tenderness") gestures at change but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized through specific foreclosed options. Emotional progression relies on poetic summary instead of micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courier's interiority is embodied through the pendant's vibrations and the physical weight of absence carried like the reliquary. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between proving presence and learning to release, enacted through micro-choices (lifting the pendant with two fingers, asking it to give back sharpness). The mentor's absence operates as both weight and teaching, shaping present choices without convenient resolution. Emotional progression remains credible—jittery need modulates to measured release—but the final stance feels more resolved than the established contradiction warrants at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is vividly embodied—"ballast had grown from her spine," boots wet with dew—and her actions (angling the prism, pressing the dashboard) drive the ritual. The narrator's internal journey from skepticism to recognition is earned through micro-choices: "I almost told her none" shifts to naming the father. The emotional arc lands cleanly when the narrator treats keys as sentient at the end, a tangible cost of new belief. Minor: Mara's motives remain slightly opaque; we infer dedication but never see her want tested.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spinner's internal state is conveyed through embodied action—touching the bead to steady breath, threading herself into listening posture—and her choices (arranging puzzle edges, releasing the bead rather than crossing herself) are causally motivated by grief and duty. The decision to stay and send only the bead rather than vanish forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor slip: the sister's late arrival reads slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized, and some interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("distance was nothing but how many layers of silence") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The meek blacksmith is rendered through consistent micro-choices—kneeling to wrap silk, offering memories as barter, pressing to the wall during tremors—that embody "quietly determined" without therapy-speak. Interiority is concrete: "fear a quiet animal that understood work better than panic" and "my heart counted possibilities like nails." The bartering mechanism (trading winter forge sounds, an unworn surname, childhood laughter) provides visible emotional cost that accumulates across beats. Minor slip: the elders' argument to wait is mentioned but never dramatized as pressure, leaving that potential friction unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's occupation and method are vividly specific—sensory mapping through taste, smell, vibration—grounding the character in consistent perceptual habits. Interior life remains abstract and diagnostic at key moments: "weight of unsaid names bending my balance" and "I know now the origin of my cycles" lean toward philosophical summary rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to unseal the crate and redirect voices arrives smoothly but without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose another path. Micro-choices exist (pocketing the shard, tapping it, climbing) but the peak decision feels frictionless, lacking the competing impulse that would earn the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's reticence is embodied through observation and quiet action rather than declaration, creating a consistent perceptual signature. The final choice to create "a lantern that would never burn" grows organically from the character's established values and methods. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between wanting to protect feeling and knowing automation will hollow the tower. Minor deduction: the motivation remains somewhat abstract; we see the *what* of protection clearly but the personal cost of losing this role could land harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and concrete—"my laugh betrays me, coming early, a pulse of shadowed elation at the edge of my teeth"—with embodied contradictions throughout. Her relationship with grandmother's legacy and storms shows depth, and the final renunciation (rewrapping the wick "like a child, knowing glass also needs tenderness") reads as earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the fishermen's gratitude and drone courier feel slightly external to her interior arc, diluting the protagonist-centered pressure at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The donor heart functions as an embodied internal contradiction throughout, twitching and changing stride in response to pressure. The protagonist's motivation to understand story magnetism generates consistent micro-choices (holding the wing, asking questions, adjusting perception). The dye master's decisions are filtered through observation rather than high-stakes agency, which limits his arc. Minor deduction for the ease with which the protagonist accepts the mystical framework without sustained internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("my secret motive was simple, stubborn, and embarrassingly tender"), with embodied choices like scooping dream dust, kissing envelopes shut, and trading a pin for a twig. Motivation is coherent: the desire to discover what trees witness drives the sextant reconstruction and the rooftop conversation. The final stance—accepting that "some work is finished simply by being carried to the light"—is earned by the accumulated particulars, though the arc leans more toward confirmation than transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's role as memory keeper is established through concrete actions—peeling mica, weaving threads, humming scales—yet motivation remains abstract until late. Interior contradiction appears weakly: the narrator carries "a line of fear" but this tension doesn't meaningfully complicate choices during the climactic weaving. The final release moment ("emptied and full, bound to their recovered days") gestures at earned transformation, but the cost feels more declared than dramatized through specific foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's guilt over the backward journal is embodied through concrete action (touching the driftwood map, writing the note), and her interiority carries a distinct filter ("harbor that feared ships"). However, the transformation feels too smooth—she moves from self-blame to self-acceptance without sufficient dramatized internal contradiction. The epiphany "I harmed nothing by meaning well, yet I still must mend what happened" arrives as articulated insight rather than through embodied struggle under pressure. The final choice to visit the patron's door has visible cost (she must admit error), but the emotional arc reads more as therapeutic release than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("creeping normality noticer," documenting losses), with embodied choices (untying the bell clapper, sweeping with pine). Internal contradiction appears in the confessed passivity ("never chained myself to anything") versus present action. However, the group dynamic dilutes individual agency; Maro and Keziah remain functional but underdeveloped, and the final stance reads more as collective ritual than a personal choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is consistent and textured through voice ("I thought of the apprentices and how their breaths made halos on the glass, their futures tender as moth wings"), with embodied micro-choices in the vow-assessment sequence. The apprentices remain gestural; their presence multiplies the on-page cast without distinct pressure. Internal contradiction appears in the narrator's tension between duty and doubt ("I wondered which promises would carry them, and which would ask to be forgiven"), but the final choice—to keep measuring despite uncertainty—feels more like endurance than transformation with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or therapy phrasing mars the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied: the fob recorder, the inherited moonshine route, the physical placement of objects during negotiation. Internal contradiction surfaces when she pours moonshine for the dead but refuses revenge, choosing "understanding sharp enough to thwart my future gullibility." The partner's mask-slipping and belt-buckle reflex are well-observed body language under pressure. Minor slip: some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("a comfort that let unease speak only the truth"), but the physicalized choices—letting false starts multiply, withholding the nod—earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator carries a consistent perceptual signature—tasting the world through the ring—but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("luminous skeptic," "futuristic nostalgia") rather than embodied. Naira's micro-climate trait is vivid, yet her choices feel exposition-driven rather than pressure-tested; the child with fog is ornamental. The final walk home registers as a stated shift rather than one earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. Diagnostic note: the closure choice (walking home "tasting the future") lacks the felt weight of foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's mnemonic gift is embodied through concrete details ("graphite map of last winter's faces") and drives the interior contradiction between perfect recall and creative paralysis. The grief over Lio's death motivates the descent with clear stakes, and the final choice to draw her "not to resurrect her but to rectify the direction grief has been pushing my hands" earns the shift. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-awareness ("inescapable callings do not ask permission to arrive") that reads more like thematic statement than lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's physical sensitivity to dishonesty provides a concrete internal contradiction that operates on the page ("my wrists went weak because I had paid with a lie"). The final confession sequence embodies emotional progression through specific admissions that accumulate pressure. However, the calligrapher's motivations remain largely told rather than tested through difficult trade-offs; the journey to the Ear unfolds without meaningful resistance that would force contradictory impulses to act simultaneously. The ending choice feels more like a revelation than a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's seasonally mute trait and her purpose to preserve wonder are present, but her interior contradictions and hierarchy of values remain generic. The villagers' emotional releases ("woman clutched her chest," "man slumped and stood") rely on bodily clichés rather than specific embodiment. The ending earns a renunciation (her voice dims, yet she is "fully heard") with some cost, but the interiority never achieves character-particular texture—phrases like "felt themselves honest, not perfect, but brave enough to begin" sound like therapeutic abstraction rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The android's interior life is vivid and contradictory—nostalgic for a childhood it never had, haunted by simulated toys, seeking resolution of "inner static" through concrete action. Micro-choices accumulate: greeting storms "like old classmates," trimming subroutines, following fire through breach. The final stance—planting packets, recognizing "fragmented wholeness" as promise—feels earned by the arc of burn and escape. Minor slip: the designer's voice ("growth is a controlled burn escape") reads slightly expository, though it anchors the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is voice-consistent and embodied ("I hear more than I speak, because the mouth fills with our own weather while the ears catch seasons"), but motivation remains largely declarative rather than tested under pressure. The curator's choices—calling for coffee, asking the inspector to wait—read as facilitative rather than revealing internal contradiction or costly trade-offs. Secondary characters (Mrs. Lin, Javi) supply information but do not pressure the protagonist's stance in ways that force a hierarchy of values. The final choice to read letters aloud lacks visible personal cost; the curator's arc is more witness than participant.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is richly particular—"calm defiance that tastes like brine," encryption as strength—but the character operates in near-total isolation with minimal micro-choices that test competing impulses. Neri appears briefly to ask questions but exerts no meaningful pressure; the protagonist's arc is a solo performance of inherited method rather than a crucible that forces trade-offs. Embodied emotion is strong in lines like "press my brow to the glass," yet the climactic liberation unfolds without on-page friction or visible cost beyond atmospheric tension. Sora's death motivates but remains backstory; no present contradiction forces the protagonist to weigh vulnerability against the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ilya's interiority is richly textured through sensory particulars (salt taste, flame lean, crystal facets), and his motivation to recover deleted memory drives micro-choices across beats. The embodied perception is strong—"air that tastes of iron rain"—and his actions (exhuming cubes, tapping the ear bone) align with his quest. However, the woman's laugh and the deleted memory remain abstract; no contradictory impulse complicates his resolve, and the final choice feels more like completion of a ritual than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The summoner remains abstract—intention and listening are asserted but no interior contradiction or embodied struggle emerges. The final action (turning the origami wing, folding a crease) reads as ritual gesture rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of poetic perception without character-particular diction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece maintains a stable, distant observational stance but does not dramatize flawed decision-making or renunciation that would earn higher credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is distinctive and embodied through specific perceptual habits ("the way you might interrogate a sleeping house by listening through the window sash"). The tutor remains enigmatic yet consistent, his patiently nimble hands and refusal to blink creating a coherent character signature. The final promise to "carry sugar and questions" emerges from the accumulation of weekly tea sessions and represents a credible commitment with relational cost. Minor slip: the tutor's reveal about being "dead" arrives late and feels more ornamental than causal, though it doesn't undermine the central relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is densely layered—"charmed skeptic," keeper of "quarantined memory"—with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) that drive the final choice. Embodied emotion appears in "bones ring," "fear once nested," and the physical act of becoming a door. The climactic decision to open "not outward, but along" earns Reina's passage through sustained interior pressure. Minor deduction: some introspective phrasing leans abstract ("translate isolation into independence") where a concrete micro-choice would sharpen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The calligrapher's interiority is specific and concrete ("calibrated treason," the mentor's unfinished work), with embodied moments (pricking finger, wrapping the thorn). However, the final choice—forgiving the unfinished and leaving one hinge closed—arrives without sufficient dramatized contradiction or visible foreclosure of a live option. The renunciation reads more as philosophic acceptance than as a decision under pressure that costs something tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and their perceptual gift is consistently shown, but interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic phrasing rather than embodied contradiction. The journey from seeking knowledge to confronting the council involves agency, but the final choice to "sing for all the stolen halves" arrives without visible internal struggle or cost that forecloses a prior path. Emotional states are declared through metaphor rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The council members remain functional obstacles without distinct pressure or credible adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied ("her voice is a bruise under my tongue, tasting like pennies and salt"), with micro-choices visible in the decision to carry the globe and speak the name. The ghost-whisperer's motivation is grounded in a hierarchy of values—truth as raft, names as salvage—shown through action. Internal contradiction emerges subtly in the line "to save her from erasure, to save myself from salvage without meaning," revealing dual stakes. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout, though the final departure lacks a visible cost that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The philosopher's choices—pinching the fray, tracing cut patterns, whistling to guide them to the widow—drive key beats with embodied perception ("brewed field tea," "puckered his lips"). The widow Yazhen's mercy-driven net-cutting is given embodied grief ("creekbed of careful grief") and a clear hierarchy of values. Minor slip: Li's interiority remains functional but less distinct under pressure. The final teaching moment (moon loops) emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the widow's apology, the elders' surprise).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's professional identity as a debunker is established early and shapes approach, but the character remains somewhat instrumental to the investigation rather than deeply contradicted by it. Internal conflict is present in the choice to write truth versus leave names out, but this arrives late and resolves quickly. Klay is well-drawn through gesture and speech ("spoke them the way a man clutches a heating stone"), applying meaningful pressure at the end. The final micro-choice—agreeing to omit names—feels slightly convenient rather than forced by visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrator remains consistent in voice and motivation (conducting broadcasts, orchestrating resistance), but interiority is largely absent—we see actions and declarations without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Kestrel's choices (standing under the portico, taking the hit) arrive without visible internal conflict or cost-laden hesitation. The piece tells us about emotional stakes ("starved," "lonely visionary") but rarely dramatizes them through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final collaboration between narrator and Kestrel is asserted rather than earned through on-page tension or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vagrant penny poet's motivations are coherent and drive micro-choices across the narrative—selecting jars, following the fox, offering the music box jar to children with specific instructions. Interiority remains concrete and particular ("I figured if the storm took me, it would at least take a town's vocabulary stitched into one breath"). The final choice to promise "more bridges in bottles" emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the storm risk, the jar given away), though the protagonist's reflective mode occasionally edges toward articulate epiphany rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. Minor deduction for the late vow that "settled differently" reading as tidy self-awareness rather than messy internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and profession-specific, filtered through lighthouse-engineer perception. The Collector's transformation feels slightly telescoped—his weeping arrives without sufficient prior micro-choices to earn the scaffolding collapse metaphor. The protagonist's own shame ("miswired the beacon") surfaces cleanly but resolves too tidily within the hum without visible cost or ongoing friction. Embodied contradictions are present but the final renunciation by the Collector lacks the ambivalence that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"sculpt patience from impatience, beginning with my own restless pulse" embodies the internal struggle. The decision to demonstrate the lunar window to the council and later lead the expedition shows agency under pressure. However, the secondary characters (Kerr, the council, the dogs) remain functional instruments rather than fully realized presences; Kerr's arc from skepticism to acceptance feels telescoped rather than earned through visible micro-choices. The final stance crystallization is legible but arrives through summary more than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The investigator's interior voice is concrete and character-particular, with contradictory impulses embodied through action (unclipping the earpiece, calling journalists despite career warnings). The choice to file an unaltered report and summon witnesses emerges from prior causality with visible cost (career risk, defiance of the director). Reflection is extensive but consistently anchors in present stimuli—lantern, gouges, grate—and drives micro-choices that alter stance. Minor slip: the great-grandmother's lantern wisdom risks sliding toward thematic assertion rather than lived contradiction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The chaplain's interior life is richly drawn through contradictory impulses—wanting to help Hector while wrestling with whether mercy can be earned. Embodied emotion appears in concrete moments: "hands that quivered but did not excuse itself," the watching for "small bright changes." The apprenticeship plan demonstrates a meaningful choice that forecloses simple advocacy with visible cost (time, reputation risk). Minor slip: Mara's interiority occasionally blurs into the chaplain's perceptual register without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sera's voice is distinct and consistent—scrappy, defiant, curious—but interiority relies heavily on metaphor and declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to ring the bell reads as inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page. Motivation is clear (yearning algorithm, bell-ringing destiny) but the protagonist's agency at the climax feels more like completing a prophesied task than wrestling with competing wants. Minor: pronoun and subject tracking remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("I wanted, more than rules allowed, to find where deleted files go"), with embodied choices under pressure. The decision to lie and descend into forbidden archives shows clear agency with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present—professional duty versus ethical imperative—though the protagonist's competence could have been tested more sharply. Minor deduction: the final renunciation ("let deletion be a home") feels slightly under-motivated given the intensity of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied ("sap on my gloves," the shard cutting the thumb as "reminder not to posture"), with micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. However, the peacekeeper role edges toward archetype without sufficient internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene—most decisions flow smoothly from the mentor's lesson rather than creating visible friction between competing impulses. The envoys' transformation occurs too quickly without sustained resistance, undercutting the cost of their promises. Backstory about the mentor and crystal fragment functions well within BRR allowance, anchoring present choices without flattening momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict between seeking ending and discovering solace is concrete and embodied, particularly through the parasol tip as "tuning fork" and hands preferring "ropes to pens." Micro-choices accumulate meaningfully: postponing the appointment "not as surrender but as a seamstress's pause." The piece occasionally edges toward poetic abstraction ("vocabulary of loss, the consonants of collapse"), but the protagonist's renunciation at closure—choosing to trawl again tomorrow—forecloses the scheduled death with visible cost (remaining a tourist, living in suspension). The change is earned through the disaster work teaching her "the notes."

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sentinel's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("keeper of pauses," the burned letter edge as "small, instructive lightning"), and the wine-to-relationship parallel structures credible counseling without therapy-speak. The traveler's arc from hoarded silence to the phone call is earned through micro-choices (tracing the letter edge, walking loops while speaking). Internal contradiction appears when the sentinel admits former pride and renunciation, visible in the bonfire memory. The final refusal to give a name is character-consistent endurance with cost—remaining anonymous after connection—though the traveler's shift feels slightly compressed given the time window.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator demonstrates some embodied interiority through micro-choices (listening sideways, cinching ropes), but remains largely observational. Lio shows consistent traits (strangely honest, trauma-informed vigilance from the tyrant incident), yet her choices feel more illustrative than genuinely pressured—the scar revelation adds texture but doesn't alter present stakes. The woman's forty-winter question and the child's laughter are held at a distance; we never see their micro-choices under the clearing's pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; the narrator accepts guidance without visible cost or resistance that would deepen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied ("tremble that travels with devotion"), with micro-choices shaped by professional expertise. However, the protagonist remains observational throughout; Ole and Marta make brief appearances but the archivist never faces a meaningful internal conflict or contradiction that forces a difficult trade-off. The ending choice to close the case "lighter than when I arrived" reads as completion rather than renunciation with visible cost. Competence dominates; struggle remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scholar's interiority is concrete and particular—"hands folded as if not to bruise the quiet," his pang at "court" as if "the room might pronounce a sentence upon sentences." Motivation is consistent and tested: the drive to decode growth in silence culminates in the testimony, a renunciation of certainty that forecloses easy proof with visible cost. Minor deduction: some reflection reads decorative rather than decision-shaping ("memory and hope braided with a kind of weathered innocence" does not alter present tactics). The final choice—offering listening over harvest—earns the stance through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness is embodied through on-page actions (writing chalk instructions, arranging driftwood) that constrain his choices with visible cost. Interior experience remains concrete and character-specific ("He could almost hear his mother turning pages somewhere long before his birth"). The final renunciation—obeying his future instruction not to rewind—demonstrates earned endurance with conceptual cost. Minor slip: the attribute occasionally feels more asserted than dramatized in micro-choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied through the repair work, with concrete sensory anchors (the leaf recording, governor floating loose). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between holding and listening, and Lina's departure provides emotional weight that complicates the present task. The final choice to send frames "to Lina if she was watching" earns its renunciation with visible cost, though some reflection edges toward abstraction ("forgiveness I could not name").

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("decisively kind is not a mood but a practice"). Ruth's handling of the vinyl shard shows embodied emotion and contradiction throughout. The reconciliation between Ruth and Lena is earned through prior tension, though Lena's transformation arrives quickly. Minor deduction for the narrator's agency being primarily facilitative rather than conflicted at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist shows clear interiority through purposeful micro-choices: winding the Archivist, building the ritual model, refusing to "take" from the shadows. The renunciation at closure—"relearn my own craft through what I now refuse to take"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses extraction with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "a light weight leaves my ribs," though some passages lean toward label-speak ("my patience has teeth"). The consistent trait of deliberate, non-extractive witness drives key beats and the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interior voice is distinctive—bone setting as metaphor for healing stories, doubt as kindness—and micro-choices (easing the thrush, admitting the winter misjudgment) embody contradictory impulses. The relationship with Mara is functional but lightly sketched; her presence pressures the narrator to act but without deep status negotiation. The final choice to return the boy and tooth is motivated by the established desire to repair past error, though the cost (admitting wrongness to the father) is quieter than transformative. Embodied emotion is present ("pulse answered with a stubborn drum") but occasionally lapses into elevated abstraction ("catalog of proofs").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is rich in sensory detail and poetic texture, but lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure. The decision to "set the pearl among the sea glass and began to teach them a shared breath" arrives without visible internal conflict or trade-off. The "lost the sky" backstory anchors present stance, yet the peak moment (choosing to share the pearl rather than keep or release it) is told through process rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied contradiction is absent when stakes are highest.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is strongly embodied through particular choices—bringing the pendant, grafting moss, choosing daily labor over public speech. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: "bravery feels different with a camera turned away" versus the impulse to speak again. The narrator's watchful-dreamer stance is consistent and particularized through selective perception (drip patterns, honeyed hush). Minor slip: the grandmother's whispers "grew roots and fruit and shelter" edges toward convenient symbolic summary without dramatized cost in the grandmother's own story, but this backstory fragment remains brief and anchored to the present choice of repurposing the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The novelist's interiority is specific and lyric, with embodied stakes ("legs were shaking," "wading through pages") and contradictory impulses—sparing the girl versus erasure—but the core tension never crystallizes into a fully dramatized micro-choice under peak pressure. The abandoned characters (girl, fisherman) provide cameo pressure yet remain thin; their dialogue delivers thematic payload more than distinct personhood. Internal conflict reads more as meditation than simultaneous warring desires acting in scene. The ending gesture of forgiveness and release carries weight but arrives through assertion rather than a visible forfeiture that closes off another path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lio operates as a cipher for whimsy rather than a character with contradictory impulses under pressure. His choices—selecting a vine, placing bells, singing—are presented as graceful demonstrations of mastery without visible internal friction or cost. The village chorus and the child receive roles but no distinct interior pressure; they orbit Lio's ritual without agency. The final decision to lie down reads as ceremonial satisfaction rather than a renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is clear and concrete—finding her brother Fen through pulse-mapping—and her physicalized patience (kneeling until knees "forgot complaint") grounds her. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract; we see her listen to bark and ribs, but internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure is minimal. The final choice to move east feels more procedural than conflicted, and no visible cost forecloses a path on the page—she gathers her tools and leaves, which reads as continuation rather than renunciation or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    The locksmith remains abstract throughout—"reflective," "peripherally focused"—but these traits function as lyric assertions rather than dramatized contradictions under pressure. Interior experience consists of metaphorical claims ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") that never fracture into competing impulses when stakes tighten. The harvesting task proceeds without genuine struggle or cost that alters the character's stance; competence is declared but never tested by failure or miscalculation that compounds on the page. Embodied emotion is absent; no physical reaction, hesitation, or sensory overwhelm disrupts the measured voice even at the mechanism's repair or the season's entry into the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Fractal weaver's interiority is present but remains abstract—"boundarylessly trapped" and "orienting properly" are repeated without embodied stakes or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The widow's absence and the boy's tremor are told, not dramatized, weakening their felt cost. The valley figure's arrival offers a potential turn, but the protagonist's response is contemplative rather than conflicted, and no micro-choice forecloses a path with visible price. Motivation stays conceptual; we do not see the weaver struggle against a competing desire or limit.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The widow's interior life is strongly particularized through embodied grief—the wrist ache as memory, the craft as steadying ritual. Her micro-choices (penciling the cage, choosing the door ajar) reflect contradictory impulses: containing without trapping, holding without choking. The renunciation of spectacle for private ritual reads earned, with visible cost in her solitary practice. Minor slip: "useful is not cold" edges toward self-aware thesis statement rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior voice is specific and patterned ("regret is a soft tool in a place that worships torque"), but her key choice—to restart the carousel—lacks embodied contradiction in the moment of decision. The negotiation with the ghost proceeds through collected stories rather than enacted hesitation or visible cost that forecloses a live alternative. The fifteen-year-old vow paid as tribute arrives late and feels more like currency than an on-page struggle that alters present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's curiosity and functional creativity are shown through concrete actions—touching railings, sketching routes, threading carnival tubing—but her interiority remains somewhat abstract and label-driven ("questions keep clicking like distant thermal relays"). The progression from puzzling to acting to inviting others demonstrates agency, yet the emotional texture stays in a narrow register of patient determination without embodied contradiction or visceral stakes. The final choice to invite the community feels earned by the fountain's success but lacks a visible personal cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The introverted clock scribe's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied desire shown through "excruciatingly gentle" handling of instruments and breath. The micro-choices—smuggling the bell, stroking its lip "the way the tide strokes a pier"—reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (carrying a bell that "did not ring and did not need to") earns Earned Stasis with visible cost: the dream is reunited but transformed. Minor slip: the introspection occasionally edges toward abstraction ("mathematics of mercy"), but recovers quickly with tactile anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"train your darkness to measure light" shapes perception, and micro-choices like leaving the sundial visible and winding the siren reveal hierarchy under pressure. Embodied emotion surfaces in "I felt older than the river and exactly its age," a paradox that avoids diagnostic labels. The watchman's morphine dependency and the foreman's final deflation add secondary pressure. However, the protagonist's competence rarely stumbles; a moment of genuine miscalculation or hesitation would sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist exhibits clear interiority—"infinitely patient," driven by a promise to preserve knowledge—with embodied perception (breath warming tar, fulgurite against hemp). The fisherman's arc from half-amused observer to active learner is earned through shared work, though his interior remains lightly sketched. Minor slip: the phrase "refusal to abandon fidelity when the world clatters" edges toward abstraction, but choices throughout (coaxing the rope, teaching the fisherman, planting the sprig) remain concrete and motivated by the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's occupation and Mira's loss provide clear motivations, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains thin—observatory rather than contradictory. The thread-tying moment and planting gesture show micro-choices, yet the narrator's transformation into someone who "writes my own living obituary" arrives as assertion rather than earned shift. Embodiment is sporadic: "heart is a coastline rewritten by storms" leans abstract when the closure beat needs concrete cost. The piece withholds genuine flaws that would complicate the narrator's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bedraggled prince exhibits concrete interiority through embodied action—tracing patterns in condensation, scavenging a pilot light, tuning it with spoons—and his motivation evolves from mechanical servitude to a stance that refuses the Treasury's demand. Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously promises "no rebellion, only a recalibration," revealing his compromise with survival. The final choice to walk the bridges with the hatchling and offer the song as metronome is earned by prior causality, though the ending crystallizes stance more than it dramatizes a decisive alteration with sharp cost. Minor deduction for "compromise is merely survival with music," which edges toward diagnostic summary in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior is poetic but often abstracted through metaphor ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert care") rather than embodied contradiction. The boy's arrival provides relational pressure, yet his characterization remains instrumental—forearm wrapped, freckled—without autonomous motive that complicates the protagonist's project. The final choice to leave the coin singing reads as thematic closure rather than a trade-off with visible cost that forecloses an alternate path. Interiority leans toward lyric assertion ("I would rather be kept by the latter") instead of micro-choices under stress that reveal hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist shows clear internal contradiction—testing everything yet carrying a mystical lantern, fearing becoming his father while following his method—and these contradictions drive the journey. The secret told to the statue ("I feared becoming him") earns the panel's opening through genuine vulnerability. Interiority remains concrete throughout ("the taste of river water and a word half-mouthed") with embodied perception under pressure. Minor deduction for the father memory sequence, which tilts toward summary rather than fully dramatized micro-choice in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and carries concrete interiority ("old ache that makes me an otherworldly sentimentalist at last useful"), but the stranger remains largely opaque—her motivation to learn is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice to pledge teaching feels more thematic echo than earned tension; we don't see her struggle between escape tradition and staying. Embodied emotion appears sporadically but the peak beat lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is embodied through physical action (tying ribbons, carving) and carries a distinct perceptual filter shaped by craft and loss. The spectral mentorship avoids therapy-speak and operates through gesture and remembered discipline. Internal conflict between instruction and judgment is felt but could press harder at the closure moment. Micro-choices (untying the braid, cutting channels where hollows demand) earn the final shift without forcing an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The winder's internal conflict is embodied through the physical act of adjusting pendulum weights while reading inscriptions. The father's drowning and the protagonist's guilt are grounded in concrete detail (misread sky, broken rake handle), and the final choice to adjust weights and visit the ridge carries visible cost. Some interiority edges toward elevated register ("searing reverie," "hollowness I can breathe") that slightly exceeds the character's established voice under peak stress, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Rowan's interior life is richly textured with embodied contradictions—"unanswered questions" in his pocket, gardening grief to keep moss from hardening—but the motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" remains abstract and never crystallizes into a visible cost or choice that forecloses a path. The chess tutor's final game is handled with care, yet Rowan himself never faces a genuine dilemma or trade-off; he performs a ritual of understanding without any risk or change in his own stance. The renunciation or endurance needed for Earned Stasis is gestured toward but not dramatized with felt pressure. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing: "the question of why the living linger" reads like prompt scaffolding rather than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's interiority is distinctive—cartographer of ignorance, embodied through brass orreries and honest maps—and drives the core choice to offer a trellis rather than a wall. Micro-choices (lifting the quill, breathing before writing, arguing with the Council) constrain present options and the final stance is earned by the narrator's vocation. However, the Council remains largely undifferentiated pressure without distinct voices or individual stakes, and the narrator's contradiction (fear of unchecked certainty vs. desire to help) is stated more than it acts simultaneously in scene. The ending crystallizes a posture but the visible cost—what the narrator forfeits by choosing the trellis—remains conceptual rather than embodied in a specific loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's characterization is strong and specific: her professional skills as copyist translate directly into action (copying phrases, annotating margins, calibrating powder), and her choices visibly alter the room's reality. The "secretly luminous" hands and inherited phosphor from outlawed scores ground her competence in embodied detail. Internal conflict appears in "refusing to cloak her answer" versus earlier caution, and the final choice to "cloak nothing" forecloses safety with visible cost. Minor: the gathering neighbors and stranger's violin introduce secondary figures whose interiority remains sketch-level, but they function as pressures rather than full agents, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly embodied ("I powder the black until it listens") and their professional stance (drawing fast, weaving truth carefully) drives micro-choices throughout. Soren's contradictory presentation—holding the mask, telling stories that "do not meet in the middle," flinching then nodding—shows authentic ambivalence without therapy-speak. The final choice to leave the mask and name is earned by the prior pressure, though Soren's agency remains somewhat passive. Strong perceptual signature and embodied emotion lift the score, with minor penalty for limited on-page struggle in Soren's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's philosophical stance and choices under pressure read consistently through concrete micro-decisions: cleaning the cog with vinegar while reciting equations, choosing to copy rather than trade, teaching four children rather than align with factions. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between self-sufficiency and the need for transmission ("I am not a pet to gratitude" vs. teaching by night). The embodied philosopher-in-sewers conceit carries specificity, though the closure choice—keeping the cog, distributing copies, teaching children—could pressure the narrator's stance more sharply; the resolution feels measured rather than costly. Emotional states remain embodied throughout (sitting on cold floor to "agonize without drama"), avoiding therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific ("expectantly resigned...a waiting that trusted the road, not a surrender to the ditch"), and the mechanic Reza's moment of vulnerability shows earned embodied emotion. However, the cast is large for this length—teacher, mechanic, nurse, boy with headphones—and most remain sketched rather than individuated with distinct pressures. The grandmother functions primarily as backstory exposition rather than as a force that complicates present choice, and the final gathering feels more performed than earned through prior contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The chef's ability to taste memories is established and drives several micro-choices (trading grandmother's memory, tasting childhood in sweat), but interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Kye's arc from erasure to arrangement shows clearer transformation with visible cost in their tears and declaration. The therapeutic framing ("synaptic plasticity," "pathways") flirts with diagnostic label-speak but stays dramatized enough through the soup's sensory effects to avoid full penalty. Motivation remains consistent, though the final choice feels more like inevitable fulfillment than a decision that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The toll keeper's involuntary truthfulness is embodied through concrete choices (asking for "reason" as toll, revealing the riddle when asked) and the lightning-kiss origin provides visceral grounding. Mara's worry and engineering mindset come through in action and diagnosis ("algorithm had overtrained the drones"). Internal contradiction appears when the keeper balances his compulsion with the craft of preservation, and the final choice to open the lacquer box again is earned. Minor slip: Mara's laugh "without relief" while "still standing near the cliff's edge" leans slightly toward label-only emotion rather than full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—listening for "displaced objects" and "small attire of misplacement"—and their ritualistic approach (orris root, vial of hush) grounds motivation in action. However, the character lacks genuine internal conflict or contradiction; the work proceeds smoothly without stakes that test commitment or force a difficult choice. The photo discovery and object repositioning feel more like choreographed tasks than moments that reveal competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present but never contradictory or under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The telepathic statue protagonist has a distinct perceptual signature—thoughts traveling through cracks, gentle incisive kindness—but agency remains largely observational. The piece provides embodied perception (tide hears me think like a choir of rust, memory shaped like ocean light on knuckles) and the narrator facilitates communication, yet the final welcoming of nuance lacks a visible cost or forfeiture on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; the narrator flows smoothly from revelation to revelation without genuine friction or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is consistently embodied through the chalk-and-dice metaphor system, with contradictory impulses (grim optimist, "balancedly daring") acting in scene. The missed-opportunity obsession drives every micro-choice on the staircase, from proof-writing to dice-rolling. The trait "grim optimist" shapes the ending's acceptance of "boundless confinement" as both prison and path, foreclosing escape with visible cost. Minor slip: the chipped-dice motivation feels slightly mechanical in repetition, nudging toward label rather than lived contradiction in two mid-section beats.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Anya's interiority is concrete and specific—"methodically hopeful, shelving glass jars of seed and rinsed brushes like votive lamps"—but her choices operate more as ritual than as pressure-tested decisions. The visitors arrive, recognize fragments, and leave gifts in a frictionless exchange; no competing impulse or internal contradiction drives a costly choice. The ledger-keeping and final palm-glyph show persistence, but the stakes never tighten to force a renunciation or meaningful trade-off. Minor penalty: the grandmother's brush trait is told rather than discovered through Anya's embodied struggle with it.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is consistently grounded in concrete objects (emerald lens, bread, trunk), and micro-choices like teaching through edible letters show character-particular thinking. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator moves from museum-keeper patience ("waiting felt like erasure") to crossing the waterfall, a shift earned by accumulated pressure. The final stance—recognizing "history is a loaf, rising only when shared warm"—grows organically from prior actions rather than arriving as diagnosis, though the epiphany risks tipping into articulation. Embodied emotion ("green stitches, tightening my borrowed courage") keeps interiority textured under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's interiority is densely textured and particular ("counter clockwise clock maker, neatly inventive"), with choices driving the mechanism's assembly and final activation. Embodied moments appear ("I traced it with a finger, and felt dry thunder moving"), though some reflection edges toward label-speak ("bleak exhilaration"). The final renunciation—binding the yoyo to the pendulum and living "in the margins"—carries visible cost and forecloses rescue for rendezvous. Internal contradiction is present (wanting the impossible vs. needing the narrower path) but could act more simultaneously in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's motivations—confronting fear through the curse, honoring the dead ringmaster—are clear and emotionally grounded in concrete memories (pinning roses, the drowning). Interior contradictions operate simultaneously: love coexists with shame, devotion with the need to break free. The whispering advisor dissolves into "the last trick of fear" at the end, which feels unmotivated by prior cues and undermines the relationship arc; this final revelation lacks earned causality. Embodied emotion is strong throughout ("tasted metallic, like biting a battery"), but the advisor's abrupt unmasking feels like a convenient twist rather than an inevitable discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tide prophet's interiority is consistent and embodied—his listening to sap, touching the mallet, reading clouds—but agency remains thin: observation and ritual performance dominate, with no moment where contradictory impulses force a choice with visible cost. The vow anchored in loss ("unable to console a storm that took his father") arrives late and remains backstory; it does not complicate present action. Micro-choices (assigning labor to trees, adjusting to cloud tempos) exist but never foreclose a path or reveal a hierarchy of values under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cartographer's motivation is clear and sustained: grief for the lost teacher drives the gate-breaking and journey. Interiority is poetic but remains concrete through gestures like "wrapped stone" and "my mouth taste of copper." The final stance—"I carry my sunwashed dread like a cautionary map"—reflects an earned acceptance of the teacher's transformation without resolving grief, a credible renunciation with visible cost. However, the protagonist's emotional state reads smoothly processed rather than contradictory under pressure, missing the hypocrisy or self-deception that would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is defined primarily by her professional role and method ("emotionally rational," "drawing parallels") rather than embodied contradictions or visceral stakes. Her interiority reads as task-oriented exposition—"she feels her throat heat, then cools it with numbers, pages, dates"—which summarizes emotion rather than enacting it under pressure. Tomas offers a credible counterweight with worry and resistance, but his pivot to collaboration arrives without dramatized internal friction or visible cost. The closure choice (publishing as calendar, not vengeance) is stated rather than shown forecloses a live option with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The surveyor's stance is consistent—a meditative archivist trading personal connection for preservation duty—and the ink-silt ritual embodies his method. Interiority remains concrete through sensory anchors (tarnished ink smell, thumb tracing lime), but no dramatized contradiction surfaces; he enacts his purpose without friction or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "less man than listening notation" reads as thematic summary rather than a choice under pressure. Minor embodiment: "fingers burn pleasantly" lands, yet the piece withholds micro-decisions that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's traits are embodied through concrete micro-choices: testing the stamp's grain, closing the lamp to use algae light, refusing to "let rage propel the index." Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between family quarrel knowledge and professional restraint ("I called him wrong without having the proof to earn it"). The final choice to leave the headlamp off and mark the arrow toward beginnings feels earned by prior pressure. Minor deduction: the "tranquilly perceptive" label appears once without dramatized cost in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior life is rendered through vivid, embodied imagery ("dress in ache," "fingers are thin maps"), and the grief-driven motive shapes choices across the narrative. The shadow's departure and Lio's loss provide clear psychological stakes. However, the piece leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the lantern-making and crane-folding feel more like extended metaphor than moment-by-moment decision points with visible tradeoffs. The final reunion with the shadow arrives without the protagonist having to surrender a competing want on the page, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is sharply embodied—"I taste iron in my mouth, and the air thins as if the past is a vacuum pump"—and the wedding-survivor trauma constrains every choice with felt cost. The decision to withhold extraction at the closure ("this pool stays intact, a grave we refused to mine") is earned by the accumulating weight of backstory anchored to present stimuli: the geode, the valley map, the breath count. Internal contradiction operates continuously: the need to function versus the refusal to harvest trauma. Minor slip: Liyun remains underdeveloped, present mainly to enable the narrator's stance rather than applying independent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The drone pilot's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("sharp-eyed," the plan "simple enough to laugh at"), and the pilgrim's trait of being "perpetually surprised" recurs with variation. However, the relationship between pilot and pilgrim lacks real friction or status dynamics; they collaborate smoothly without contradictory impulses testing either character. The final choice—departing to follow coordinates—feels more like acceptance of a revealed map than a decision that forecloses a path with visible internal cost. Embodied emotion is present but never contradictory within a single moment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's guilt and contradictory impulses are embodied through concrete choices—pressing the watch hand, levering the slat, writing the letter—each with visible cost. Interiority is specific ("tempered regret is the only armor I own") and the final renunciation (refusing to "sell comfort" or "sell silence") forecloses the profitable path with felt weight. Minor deduction: the fisherman and Mara remain off-page, limiting relationship pressure; the protagonist's change is earned but operates largely in reflection rather than live confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied ("my chest holds their breath," weighing words), with lived contradiction (last winter's mistake still pressuring present choices). The micro-choices under pressure—asking Neris to try again with Daro's name, untethering wrists—show value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "uncommonly thoughtful" self-descriptor edges toward hedging rather than letting action prove it; some gestures (touching the drawer pull) recur without fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal contradiction—skilled navigator lost to regret—drives embodied micro-choices (one foot in the kayak, pausing at the bow). The sister encounter earns the apology through accumulated pressure rather than epiphany. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("merrily melancholic by habit," "flickering faith sputter") that softens the embodied texture, and the final paragraph's "I understood" edges toward summary. The confession beat ("I said them anyway") lands with visible cost but the reconciliation telescopes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist's interior voice is consistent and embodied ("jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke"), with clear motivation through confessed past acts. However, the character remains somewhat abstract—the fire confession arrives late and the brother appears only in thought. Micro-choices (steering by the ball, pouring the vial) show agency, but the transformation from dirty past to empathy-seeker lacks intermediate friction on the page; the procedure erases memory yet conscience "stayed wired awake" without dramatizing that contradiction's cost in a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator's grief-to-transformation arc is embodied through concrete actions (opening vials, breathing spices, pressing the fortune to tongue), and the final choice to "finish the walk into feathers" carries visible cost—abandoning human form. However, interiority leans toward lyric declaration ("Grief wants me to break; love wants me to bend") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The beloved's return as embers is vivid, but their agency remains thin; they guide rather than resist, flattening potential friction at the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cartomancer's interiority is densely embodied through contradictory impulses—joy/dread braiding, wanting to be perplexed—and the final tracing of the baby's hand over her own earns the shift toward acceptance. Emotional states avoid therapy-speak and live in concrete images: "minutes... glinting like an apology finally believed." Minor slips: the motivation for leaving the house feels slightly abstract until the ritual begins, and the midwife's advice to rest is told rather than dramatized. The arc from restless seeking to whispered promise carries visible cost (the acknowledgment of thrown-away time, the weight of future commitments).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("gravitationally lighter when happy" embodied through ship mechanics), and the shadow work creates genuine internal contradiction ("how gently spoken neglect had bruised me into silence, and how I had bruised others by echo"). The pacifist oath drives micro-choices under pressure (declining the warhead, choosing patience and stitching). Minor slip: the midwife's smile as happiness trigger feels slightly convenient, but the final renunciation—sleeping "not victorious but kept"—carries visible cost and forecloses triumphalism.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is present through sensory filters ("whispering hush pressed against her ears") and her practice of orchestrating kindness shows embodied choice. However, her competence is never genuinely threatened—every coincidence falls into place without visible struggle or error, flattening internal contradiction. The rescue unfolds through perfect execution rather than flawed agency under duress, and the boy's mother lacks any interior presence beyond "ash tears," remaining a rescue object rather than a second character with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lock sentinel shows clear interiority and embodied choice when wedging the bronze quill holder to bridge the wheel's corroded teeth. Internal texture remains consistent—"keys clinked like cool birds nesting," "my mind kept its winking hush"—with purposeful compression. However, motivational depth lacks visible internal conflict; the sentinel moves through the intrigue with calm inventiveness but no contradictory impulses testing commitment. The collective "we" dilutes individual stakes; companions arrive and depart without friction, flattening the crucible that would elevate characterization into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The eel herder's motivation is concrete—placing painted stones in mathematical sequences—and embodied through repeated action ("I scoop it with a bowl carved from driftbone"). The precognitive curse adds interior contradiction ("I feel the futures sliding too, a thousand versions of my hands shivering"), but the central relationship with "she" remains abstract; we learn only that a promise was made, not what visceral need drives the repeated attempts beyond the stated desire to "understand sacred patterns." The final choice to let go of the bowl feels earned by the accumulation of ritual, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

    Ilya's interiority is specific and embodied—"breath thin as the mountain air," tracing metal with purpose—but his arc from arrival to reading lacks a visible internal contradiction acting in scene. The final recitation feels like permission granted rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

    The protagonist's role as dueling philosopher with mechanical arm reads as ornamental – the arm clicks approval but never constrains a choice.

    The vagrant penny poet's "molts personalities monthly" trait appears as a label without constraining an on-page choice with visible cost; the narrator shifts from "ledger" to "firelight" but this change doesn't alter tactics or force a tradeoff. Mara's prison backstory and her handling of the bars ("remembers her cell, and does not speak") embodies her past through gesture, but the friendship's formation is told rather than shown pressuring present choices. Interiority is concrete and metaphor-rich ("My skull molts personalities monthly"), yet the poet's interior contradictions don't compel a difficult choice under pressure—the rebuilding proceeds steadily without internal friction forcing a costly decision.

    The pianist's interiority is distinctly rendered through concrete perceptual filters (the station's "compasses in its bones," the arbor's "bench of salt-bleached wood shaped to my back and to her absence"). Internal conflict manifests in the tension between pride that caused the quarrel and the longing that drives the musical pursuit, though the reconciliation moment lacks sufficient embodied cost—Mara's return and their laughter feel too easily won given the stakes established. The protagonist's agency is present but the final beats don't fully dramatize what is surrendered or risked to achieve reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and voice-particular ("luminous doubt that guides us toward a fidelity larger than proof"), but motivation remains largely abstract—protecting cultural memory is declared, not tested through contradictory impulses. Micro-choices (lowering the seed, reciting the treaty) advance procedure rather than revealing hierarchy of values under competing pressure. The final bite of the fruit gestures toward acceptance but lacks the embodied cost or internal contradiction that would earn a meaningful change. Competence is high; struggle registers as atmospheric rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's interiority is richly specific ("tongue heavy, the day I could have said I am sorry and did not") and embodied through ritual with the bonsai and compass.

Minor deduction: Mara remains a construct of memory without contradiction or flaws that would complicate the narrator's idealizing lens; the severance feels one-sided. The ending crystallizes renunciation and acceptance with visible cost (walking away "slowly," relinquishing control).

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a mind trained on neutron stars applying the same rigor to flood damage, with a clear, specific drive to “strip needless drama” even as grief and attachment leak through. Motivation is consistent and enacted in micro-choices (which orchids to save, how to phase repairs, the way they dry the botanist’s notes) rather than only stated. Internal contradiction—rational slope-thinking vs. the pull of mourning—is present but stays mostly implied; a slightly more pressured moment of emotional conflict could deepen this further. The relationship with the botanist is delicately drawn and believable despite minimal on-page interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation (to understand the attack and repurpose it into art and safe passage) is clear and consistent, and her identity as a glass artist shapes perception and choice throughout. Interiority is specific and character-particular, especially in how she “lets the ledger strip breathe” and reads numbers as constellations. However, emotional response to the assassination attempt and ongoing danger stays mostly in a calm, elevated register, with limited contradictory impulses or stress degradation on the page. The final stance—choosing to rebuild and continue the testament—feels earned but could carry more viscerally embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s core motive (the vow after the ferry) is clear, embodied, and drives every choice, especially the collaboration with Sura and the bell scene. Interiority is specific and textured (“my heart had become a buoy, bobbing without map nor harbor”), not generic. The relationship with Sura functions as a crucible, culminating in her wrist-touch question about whether the music is enough to keep the narrator afloat. The internal conflict—adrift survivor vs. maker of bridges—feels coherent and earns the quiet endurance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The undertaker’s motivation—“to give rest a permanent address”—is clear, consistent, and made specific through his embodied responses to signals and the dead. His contradictory impulses (weariness vs. obedience to the tapping; duty vs. shame) are dramatized rather than labeled. The climactic choice to wedge himself “between the cracked lens and the watery light” feels fully earned by the traits and history implied earlier. The only slight limit is that we glimpse his past indirectly rather than seeing one sharp, concrete prior failure to deepen his current cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The collective “we” POV and the focus on Mara, Noor, and Farid create clear, specific motivations—survival, protection through anonymity, and the hunger for recognition. The generational tension between Noor and Farid is sharp and credible, and Mara’s temperament is consistently dramatized through choices rather than labels. However, interior contradiction is mostly implied rather than felt from the inside; we rarely inhabit Noor’s or Farid’s bodies or moment-to-moment confusion directly, which slightly blunts the emotional cost. The final shifts (Noor finding the bell lighter than his doubts; Farid tasting salt) are resonant but could land even harder with a touch more embodied ambivalence earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motives and interiority are vivid and consistent, and the gradual realization about “unused love” feels earned by the ritual they enact. The friend is sketched economically but specifically (“someone who survived both fire and silence”) and his cooperation under pressure tracks. The main limitation is that internal conflict stays gentle—there’s not much live resistance in the narrator to what they discover, so the cost of change is muted. Still, the arc from seeking to understanding lands with credible emotional coloration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “discover the texture of time”—is specific, consistent, and clearly drives every choice from returning to the garden to surrendering the shard. Interiority is rich and embodied through plant, breath, and architectural metaphors rather than labels. The key turn (choosing to let the shard disintegrate and relinquishing the photographs) feels well-earned by prior beats. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is that internal contradiction (e.g., a stronger on-page pull between hoarding vs. relinquishing the past) could be slightly sharper under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivations (seeds over keys, impede without becoming a Collector) are clear, specific, and consistently drive her tactics. The chain, grandmother’s legacy, and her ambivalence about “liberator” status create real internal tension without over-explaining. Micro-choices—hooking the chain to the bench, deciding to teach the Collectors instead of stonewalling—reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The only slight limitation is that her emotional volatility under peak pressure remains very controlled, almost serenely composed, which softens messier contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is precise, consistent, and deepens credibly as we move from abstract research to the confrontation with the father. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (synesthetic perception, professional focus, salvager past), and the father–child relationship becomes the crucible where this is tested. The final choice—to accept a cold, honest tone rather than demand apology or catharsis—reads as an earned, costly endurance rather than a neat fix. Contradictory impulses (need for a blueprint vs. desire for connection) are active in the closing scene without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is sharply realized: the mix of ritualistic duty, sly professionalism, and latent vulnerability around the jar and the florist feels particular and grounded. The later recognition of the man as an older self with “a familiar, repaired grief” retrofits earlier confidence with a credible seam of past hurt. The mother’s-surgery legend as motivator is clean and helps tether the fantastical job to an emotional core. If anything, the internal tug-of-war around the risk of intervening in his own history could be made a shade more fraught on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply etched: patient, ritual-bound, stubbornly gentle, and her pledge “not to abandon the questions” motivates every choice she makes in the room. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (bookmark between teeth, tasting “old oil and library dust”) and her actions—narrating to dust, singing to the generator, counting breaths—consistently reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is quiet but present in the tension between past hail-like critique and her current, almost ascetic care for inquiry. The endurance choice at the end (staying, planning “Tomorrow I will…”) feels earned, though the emotional cost of isolation could be shaded a touch more explicitly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s fear/competence contradiction is vivid and consistent: a phobia-ridden stunt double whose body can do what her mind dreads, and this tension drives every move from threading the projector to guiding Kellan from the rotten boards. Motivation is clear—reclaim selfhood, expose Kellan, refuse to be “only the body that bruises”—and the final stance (“done being a composite”) is well-earned by prior beats. Embodied details (mapping exits, ribs “counting exits,” fear like a “hot ladder”) give emotions specificity rather than label. The choice to help Kellan rather than let him fall shows a credible value hierarchy and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to make a map of an impossible, “endless night”—is clear and consistent, and his friction with the oracle (edges vs. silence) reveals a genuine internal shift. The oracle feels specific and embodied (“grains clicked in her braids like soft teeth,” “stick that had tasted foam”) and applies direct pressure on his habits of thought. Emotional texture is mostly carried through perception and metaphor rather than explicitly dramatized conflict, which keeps the piece slightly cool. A touch more concrete, bodily response at a peak moment (e.g., when reading the map aloud) would bring this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    JN-3’s motive (“to find where thoughts come from”) is clear, particular, and consistently refracts every task, from sweeping to bowing the violin. The interiority is vivid and character-specific—mechanical yet poetic (“composure holds the dust together”), with an earned shift from pure function to stewardship. Internal conflict between quotas/haste and listening/attention is present but could be dramatized under sharper pressure to fully enter the 9-band. The final endurance choice (slowing down, choosing care over quotas) reads as an earned stasis with a quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The registrar’s interior conflict between preserving a fragile peace and risking it for transparency is specific and well-motivated, with the key beat being “If I revealed this, I would reveal myself.” Her choices (stealing the lens, staging the projection, logging a confession) clearly arise from that conflict and feel earned. Rell’s characterization is thinner but still distinct, largely through rumor and his silent, embodied response at the end. The mutual surrender to seeing at the projector lands as a credible change with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator is sharply etched: stubborn, wry, self-critical, and tender toward the maze. His history of earlier deception versus current “mended deception” gives him a credible moral contradiction that drives present choices. Body and age details (“bent shoulders,” “a man who looks like tinder”) ground his interior stakes. His endurance at the end reads as an earned stance, not a default.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hale’s characterization is vivid and particular—“obliging sky mechanic,” “icy warmth,” his patience and exactness all align with his quiet obsession to prove sideways time. His motivation is clear, threaded from the balloon accident through to the experiment, and his final easing of the lever feels like a small but earned prioritization of care over proof. The relationship with Sera is delicately sketched but legible in status and trust. The main limitation is that his internal contradiction (ambition vs gentleness) never comes under truly sharp pressure, so the cost of his choice remains subtle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musician’s interiority is specific and convincing—her anxiety, professionalism, superstition, and moral hesitation all surface in concrete choices (“The proper thing was to tell someone, but language seemed as clumsy as wet wood”). Her decision to disrupt rehearsal feels earned by the build-up of listening, decoding, and fear, with a clear value hierarchy (safety over decorum). Internal contradiction (skepticism vs. belief, obedience vs. disruption) is present but could be pushed a touch harder in the immediate pre-disruption beat. Secondary characters (conductor, house manager, ghost) function well as pressures but remain silhouettes, which is fine at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s guilt, professional rigor, and love for Luca are woven into nearly every perception and choice, giving her a vivid, specific interior life. The core decision—to finally warn the valley and expose her earlier silence—is fully motivated by the history with Luca and the swallowed truth about the glide plane. Contradictory impulses (duty to data vs. protecting Luca, donors, and her own denial) are present simultaneously rather than in neat stages. The cost of change—accepting blame and inviting public anger—is clearly felt at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Motivation is clear and compelling—she comes to the tunnel to test her mother’s confession—and every micro-choice (turning the wheel, sliding into the niche, pocketing the tag) aligns with that drive. The internal contradiction of being “religiously skeptical” yet following a “liturgy made of rust” gives her interiority nuance without overt therapy-speak. Emotional states are embodied and specific (the tag in her cheek like a coin, the beads biting her skin) rather than labeled. The final endurance—choosing to carry the truth’s weight rather than seek a ghost—is a credible earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The keeper’s motivation—to witness without judgment—pervades the piece and credibly deepens into “tending” by the end, especially in “my task deepen from writing to tending, as if the record wanted a more human ink.” Interiority is distinctive and consistent, with choices (not fleeing during the crack, leading refugees to the refuge, planting cuttings in books) aligning with this ethos. However, emotional life remains mostly in a serene, contemplative register; we rarely see sharp internal contradiction or embodied stress, even when the city cracks and refugees arrive. That limits the felt cost and keeps the character from fully three-dimensional complexity at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivations are clear and specific—Lena’s protective hope, Felix’s guardedness, and the narrator’s ethic of non-coercive care all register—and the final “not a cure, but a beginning” feels earned by prior choices. The relationship dynamics are tender but not saccharine, with small behaviors (curl, hand-holding, heel-tapping) revealing stakes. Felix’s interiority is mostly inferred rather than accessed, which slightly mutes the sense of contradiction under pressure. The narrator’s “cautious exuberance” is more stated than dramatized as an active inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The odd historian is distinct, with consistent motives (to hear and preserve what walls remember) and a clear perceptual signature, but he rarely meets resistance or contradiction that would expose deeper fault lines. His “sensitively perceptive” nature is mostly a gift, not a conflicted trait with on-page cost. The most character-revealing beat is his choice to “hold it as vibration first,” privileging embodied listening over documentation. The final stance—taking on the work of writing so “the walls could rest”—is earned but emotionally underplayed, keeping this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s role, sensibility, and method are sharply drawn and consistent, and the secondary trio each get a precise, revealing beat (the ledger with “mercy,” the empty palms, the ferryman’s stance). Motivation is clear—she wants to reframe the island’s open secrets—yet internal contradiction and felt cost are muted; she moves through the piece with confident competence more than conflict. Relationships are warm and legible but rarely stress-tested on the page. The ending’s “no sorcerer” self-definition is earned but does not close a deeply contested inner dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ruan’s characterization is vivid and coherent—his vocation as someone who “argue[s] with shadows” and decorates with silence cleanly motivates his choice to confront the demon via questions. The demon’s psychology (fear of complexity/surprise, hunger for the “flat”) is specific and non-generic, and Ruan’s rhetorical maneuvers read as deliberate tactics, not authorial puppetry. Mara is more a vessel than a fully realized interior presence, which slightly mutes emotional stakes, though her speckled wrists and exhausted voice hint at a life beyond the scene. The final shift—possession loosening because the demon reframes its hunger—feels earned by prior lines of questioning.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—to resolve “chronological homesickness” by becoming the conductor of unheard symphonies—is specific, consistent, and drives every action in the spire. Interiority is rich and particular (“each slip I pen is a folded compass pointing inward”), with embodied emotion in the cold, breath, and ascent. Internal contradiction surfaces as wanting return without retreat, and the ending accepts a costly, enduring stance: letting the tones “hold me back” instead of forcing them. Relationships are absent, but for a single-POV lyric piece the character arc feels earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s motivation and internal stakes are clear and consistent—escaping periodic eternity and the self-labyrinth—and his final renunciation of floating and embrace of “walking home like everyone else” feels earned. The interplay between his compulsion to reset and his longing to arrive gives him credible contradiction. However, emotional texture sometimes stays at the conceptual/image level (“labyrinth of self,” “periodically eternal”) rather than pushing into more concrete, character-particular embodiment of fear, shame, or desire. The relationship with the mother-memory is powerful but sketched; the emotional cost of that shard could go one notch deeper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lena’s motivation—“I need to feel again, because my students cannot find their pulses in the chairs”—is precise, embodied, and drives every choice from entering the cavern to using the drum in class. Her interiority is rendered through tactile and metaphorical perception rather than label-speak, and the guilt centered on the phonograph needle is deftly dramatized. The final change (from numbness to a fragile, risky re-sensitization) feels earned and not tidy, with a visible cost in her willingness to reopen grief. Risto is economical but vivid as a relational crucible whose silence and gestures apply pressure rather than comfort alone.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s voice and values (“meticulous storm recorder,” “for the unowned”) are sharply etched, and their patience-as-courage is consistently dramatized. Motivation is coherent—protecting unowned truth and integrity—yet internal conflict is relatively muted; they rarely feel genuinely torn, more steadfast than pressured. The late interaction with the woman in the gray coat nicely externalizes the narrator’s ethos without betraying it. The cost of that ethos is stated (“even if it costs comfort”) more than embodied, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s grief, professional identity, and “aromatically cautious” restraint produce a coherent, particular psychology that governs every choice, especially the delayed but decisive opening of the vial. Interiority stays embodied and specific (grocery-aisle floods, “door swing behind my cheekbones”) without sliding into diagnostic language. The relationship with Dr. Vale is sketched efficiently yet carries lived history through his anecdote about his father and his small, considerate gestures (offering the mask, adjusting the lamp). If anything, the internal contradiction could surface slightly earlier under more active pressure, but the final renunciation of caution in favor of clean grief feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives and ethic (“ethically playful”) are specific and consistently drive choices, especially in refusing the beings’ bargain and seeking a layered solution. The escapee’s obsession with the “second that refuses to pass” gives him a clear, embodied conflict that intersects well with the narrator’s agenda. Interiority is vivid and particular rather than generic, with values revealed through image-driven choices (braiding knots thinner, trading a poem). The only slight limitation is that the escapee remains more emblem than fully individuated person beyond his central trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motivation—to loosen the hush and “find beauty in the unfinished”—is clear and consistently dramatized through choices like answering each drop “with a note that lands close but not exact” and using the cracked bell. Interiority is mostly carried through sensory attention and action rather than explicit thought, but it still feels character-specific and embodied. The implied internal conflict between grieving what’s lost and committing to imperfect, communal sound is credible if understated. Relationships (especially with the boy and the gathered townspeople) could sharpen her contradictions a bit more, but her final refusal of perfection is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation and internal contradiction—wanting to fuse insight and empathy while staying one step back from the fire—are sharply drawn and consistently dramatized. Liora’s need for “courage enough to finish the base accord of a memorial perfume without embalming herself in grief” creates a clear relational crucible that forces both of them into risk. Micro-choices, like threading her confession into the accord “neither absolving nor accusing,” show a hierarchy of values under pressure. The only small limit is that we glimpse only one client, so we infer rather than see a wider pattern of the narrator’s flaws compounding across multiple encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The broker-narrator’s mix of logistical competence and almost mystical attentiveness (“counting cranes like stars and stars like cranes”) gives them specificity and grounds their motivation to honor invisible labor. Interiority is rich and character-particular, though internal conflict stays relatively gentle—more a quiet tension between shrewdness and tenderness than a hard dilemma. Micro-choices (carrying the envelope himself, pledging logistics, choosing “letters over trumpets”) credibly reveal values. Lena and the tuner are sketched with economical, vivid strokes that support but don’t overtake the protagonist’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to graft myself onto community”) is vivid, consistent, and drives every on-page choice, from hauling the reeds to dedicating the bench. Interiority is concrete and particular (“reeds remember every hand…,” “a luminescent ache in my chest”), not generic. The relationship with Neri functions as a crucible: their sympathy and mild teasing test the narrator’s fear of outsiderhood and midwife the final act of offering. The only minor limitation is that the narrator’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. desire to belong) are more stated than truly stressed in a hard dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to find where echoes are born—threads cleanly through every choice, from climbing the ladders to defying the guild by lifting the sluice. Interiority is rich and particular (the sketchbook “braver than my hands,” the ethics of “theft with interest”), and her professional eye shapes how she conceptualizes echoes. The internal conflict between curiosity and responsibility is present but could surface a hair more viscerally at the peak (the giant’s twitch, the watcher’s arrival). The final letting-go of the echo reads as a believable, earned endurance rather than a tidy conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conjurer’s motivation—transmuting ambiguous loss into “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and drives every choice in the ritual. Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (taxidermist’s eyes, “love is a ratio between breath and waiting”), with a credible tug between wanting proof and accepting uncertainty. The final stance—dovetailing grief with practice rather than seeking resolution—reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost. The only thing keeping this short of top-tier is that the apprentice, as a relational crucible, remains more conceptual than dramatized in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (caretaking, shy desire for visibility) are clear and consistently embodied in their routes, tools, and rituals, and Mara comes through sharply in very few lines (“eyes raw, hands steady”). The contrast between near-invisibility and the compulsion to intervene gives credible internal tension without ever being over-explained. The final choice to step from the pipe door feels earned by the prior pattern of indirect care. If anything, Mara’s interiority is mostly inferred rather than dramatized, which keeps this just short of maximal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s shift from schedule-obsessed mastery to humble stewardship is clear, textured, and convincingly motivated by repeated encounters with storms and the leaf. Interiority is specific (“notes that read like apologies,” the itch where the “glove of routine” fit) and the contradiction between wanting control and choosing to release it plays through the whole piece. Theo’s presence adds a subtle relational crucible via his question about the leaf’s intention and his “translations” for customers. The final stance—letting the leaf decide where shelter belongs—feels earned and carries a quiet but real cost in anxiety and loss of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The painter’s motivation (“to thresh meaning from experience”) is vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices—picking up the brooch, deciding to follow the rain, agreeing to paint—align cleanly with that drive. Embodied emotion comes through more in image than in explicit feeling but still reads as particular (ribs ringing “like struck brass,” hunger for meaning). Internal contradiction is relatively soft: he states hunger vs. modesty about “dressing it up,” but those tensions are not deeply dramatized in scene. The relationship with Mara is flavorful and specific, though it never truly functions as a crucible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator-guide and the pilgrim both feel specific and textured, with the clairvoyant’s self-deprecating blindness and the pilgrim’s vow to the sweeping child giving them clear, particular motives. The narrator’s mix of authority and uncertainty (“my uncertainty rings like a bowl, sweet and alarming”) gives a credible inner tension. However, the emotional risk of letting the shadow “inhabit” their shared vowel could be shaded more sharply—there’s curiosity and unease, but little sense of what the narrator stands to lose. The relationship dynamic is gentle and respectful throughout, which fits the tone but limits pressure between them.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s worldview and vocation are specific and compelling, and their choices—to listen, to fit the valve, to refuse to blow the trumpet—are motivated and consistent. Emotional texture is strong but leans more toward role and philosophy than embodied contradiction; we rarely feel them truly torn. The boy and his father serve the arc cleanly but remain lightly sketched. The final stance (“I remain the ocean-spray archivist…”) feels earned as a deepening rather than a sharp internal turn, appropriate but slightly limiting in impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motive—to answer the dare and confront the “fortress of unspoken truths”—is clear, consistent, and deepens as they begin offering their own silences as fare. Interiority is specific and character-particular (maps as “geometry of feelings”), and the key flaw—rerouting around their own truths—is dramatized rather than labeled. The offerings (father’s choked apology, lost lover, half maps) show real cost and reveal a hierarchy of values. The only limitation is the relatively gentle depiction of internal contradiction; doubt or resistance could have been foregrounded more under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance and guilt over Estera create a rich, contradictory interiority that drives every choice, especially the decision to offer up their own painful memory. Lio’s fear/desire tension around preserving his sister’s memory is sharply etched and plays directly into the central moral calculus. Emotions are embodied and specific (“the sound like surf against mussels”) rather than labeled. The closing endurance—remaining a skeptic but with a “shape” for sympathy—feels earned and costs the narrator their prior emotional safety.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The immortal narrator’s boredom, curiosity about “after goodbye,” and calculated use of Mara form a coherent, specific psychology, and their final renunciation feels earned by the setup. Contradictory impulses—wanting mutiny yet needing witnesses, craving escape yet orchestrating danger—are dramatized rather than told. Mara is sketched efficiently through her goal-driven presence and hinted loyalties. The only limit is that Mara’s inner stakes remain mostly implied, so her cost at the end is more conceptual than emotionally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions are sharply drawn: an “honest child” of a con artist who uses his tools and techniques in service of truth. Her hierarchy of values (breath vs. truth vs. petty defiance) is dramatized in micro-choices, especially when she suppresses defiance to avoid drawing police attention. Emotional texture tends to stay in controlled, conceptual language rather than raw disarray, but that coolness fits her profession and the scene’s stakes. The endurance at the end—accepting the cost of carrying names to mothers—reads as an earned stasis rooted in prior traits.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a meticulous, self-restrained archivist of vanished routines whose work and inner ethic are consistent throughout. Motivation (“to collect the textures of different times”) is dramatized via specific practices (charting the lamp, gilding pages, walking the maze) rather than just stated. Internal tension—wanting to shout at the wind vs. choosing “incandescent restraint”—is present but remains subtle, never pushed into a major on-page crisis. The endurance choice at the end feels earned, though the cost could be felt even more acutely for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s psychology is rich and specific—“a ghost with legal breath” whose need for proof collides with her refusal to trust paper—giving her a distinct, embodied inner life. Her choice not to write anything down and to carry histories “in breath and gait” is a strong, character-driven renunciation with cost. The relationship with the woman near the end adds a credible, understated shift from solitary witness to shared practice. The only limit is that her internal contradictions never face a sharply peaked moment of decision; the arc is more deepening than turning.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific, paradoxical, and consistent—“gloomy cheerfulness” and the self-described “myth buster” stance inform every choice. Motivation is clear (decode the riddle / test stories without breaking them) and evolves into a more vulnerable goal (owning the old silence with the friend). The decisive act—speaking the long-delayed apology and accepting a softer, less totalizing answer—is well prepared and carries visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that the off-page friendship remains a bit abstract, slightly muting the relational stakes of that apology.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives and contradictions—dual allegiance, duty to both spectacle and residents—are sharply etched and consistently drive choices. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“Hopeful desperation had a smell, like citrus rind squeezed over rust”), avoiding generic emotion labels. Yano and Miri are economical but effective foils whose pressure forces the narrator into a costly middle path. The final stance shift from “split” to “braid” feels earned by prior actions rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives—logging micro-impacts vs. secretly preserving the last unbranded dawn—are sharply etched and consistently drive choices. Interiority is specific (“because [the camera] forgives me for trembling”) and embodied with concrete ritual, tools, and sensory focus. The relationship with the mentor is efficiently but vividly rendered through the chemical-message inheritance, producing an earned emotional throughline. The only brake on a higher score is that simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure are more implied than actively dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s competence, sensory strategies, and plain old motivation are vivid and specific, and her bond with the drone and Jaro gives her warmth beyond the “blind genius” trope. However, she faces minimal genuine resistance; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or emotional fraying under time pressure. Her choice to keep listening and decoding feels more like steady vocation than a pressured, costly decision. The relationship with Jaro is lightly sketched but functional rather than a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to locate the rivers’ singular source against institutional skepticism—is clear, consistent, and filtered through a distinctive, dry intelligence. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“a suspicion the world has one hidden eye,” “my editors prefer tidy estuaries”), and actions (trusting the condensation, honoring the bargain with the falcon) align with that worldview. Internal tension between worry (“the wind does not snarl, which worries me more”) and stubborn confidence (“I can laugh at my own hunch and still bet the trip on it”) is well dramatized, though the ultimate cost to self remains mostly conceptual rather than felt in a deeply personal wound. The final endurance—accepting being disbelieved while standing by the discovery—reads as an earned stasis with modest but real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator and the bell tuner are sharply etched through action and image, with the tuner’s ethos emerging via how he listens, corrects, and refuses spectacle. Motivation is clear—revive communal balance through rhythm—and the narrator’s shift from outsider to keeper of time is credible. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (awe vs. skepticism/uncertainty), so the arc leans more toward initiation than struggle. Relationships are functional but not deeply conflictual, which keeps this just short of truly searing characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motive (“to harness the ephemeral,” rooted in the mother’s teaching) is vivid and consistently drives choices, especially the refusal to abandon the mission when the gauges “shouted the numbers that end journeys.” Internal conflict is strong in the net sequence, where panic fights with the learned discipline to go still and “override instinct.” Emotions are embodied in images (marionette, hawk claws, statues) rather than labels, and the final stance—risking themselves to send the hush—feels like an earned extension of earlier values. The only slight limiter is that the narrator’s flaws and potential blind spots (e.g., the cost to self vs. obligation to the living) are implied rather than sharply dramatized in a specific relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in the inherited trauma of being "the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son," which cleanly motivates his obsession with hush and mistrust of easy belief. His micro-choices (stealing the lattice, reading scuffs, following the hush, choosing “work and quiet” over howling) consistently reveal values and flaws. The final renunciation of his father’s pattern feels earned and forecloses a path with conceptual cost. The only thing holding this shy of the very top band is that emotional contradiction under peak pressure stays more lyrical than sharply dramatized in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s guilt, craft-obsession, and willingness to be tutored by a haunting all read as specific and coherent, and the ghost bride’s mix of tenderness and threat creates a vivid relational crucible. Micro-choices—inviting her instruction, confessing the “old leaving,” speaking the name—are motivated and pay off at the end. Internal conflict (love, fear of failing her twice, obligation to the trees) is present but could surface in a few more embodied, contradictory beats instead of being mostly implied. Still, the emotional and motivational throughline feels earned at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, worldview, and optimism are vividly particular, and her actions (following the sleepwalkers’ paths, “sewing” the seam open, making the tactile book) all arise from that identity. Interiority is embodied through sensory metaphors rather than labels, and her optimism is connected to a concrete practice of attention under pressure. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a palpable internal conflict or visible personal cost; she never seems genuinely torn or at risk of failing her charge. The final stance feels earned but relatively untroubled, which slightly flattens the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is sharply etched as a diaspora returnee whose “hands remembered nothing and a heart that remembered everything” gives her an immediate inner contradiction. Her warmly curious, not-quite-brave stance shapes choices like purposeful wandering and the gentle, reverent handling of the gnomon. The relationship with Aram is understated but effective, functioning as a supportive crucible that invites but never bullies change. The final reorientation of her faith and role (“not to judge the dead or the living, but to rebuild the road between them”) feels earned by the prior interior work.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is vivid and particular—a professional anonymizer who loves margins and reads chalk games as codes—so his interiority feels grounded and specific. Mira is sketched efficiently through gesture and tension (pinching the letter, scanning the arches), though she remains more vessel than fully pressured agent. Motivation is clear (protecting identity and words from surveillance), but internal contradiction is muted; the narrator never feels genuinely torn between caution and his almost romantic attachment to paper and names. The final charged pause “before a letter is mailed” registers as a stance, but the cost of that stance could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tamsin’s vocation, methods, and self-presentation as a “fool by design” are sharply drawn and consistent, and her choices (misaligning the bells rather than exposing the coup) feel distinctively hers. Her motivation to listen for “unheard stories” is dramatized through micro-choices—listening between bells, reading amended charts, nudging the pendulum. The internal conflict between her limited, nearly invisible interventions and the inevitability of the coup is there but stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied. A touch more visceral emotional texture under pressure would push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—to revisit the pre-decision moment with her brother—is clear, particular, and governs every choice, from bringing the eelgrass-bound letters to accepting the medium’s terms. Interiority is richly embodied (“air tastes like copper and lullabies,” the splinter in the doorframe grounding her urge to flee), and the internal conflict between self-protective avoidance and the need to stay in the room feels credibly knotted. The relationship with the brother is sketched through one decisive omission rather than summary psychology, which gives the on-page re-visit weight. The final renunciation of the cigarette break and the relinquishing of the letter credibly foreclose a prior self without neat moral hygiene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives and inner contradictions are vivid and specific: they’re both a professional mediator and someone with “old wounds,” and their selective withholding of information from the families feels morally fraught yet grounded. Sifa, though mostly unconscious, is deftly characterized through his “shrewdly innocent” planning and the coded cast. The final acceptance of a partial truth-telling—“not every truth heals; the cast has taught me which truths wait for safer light”—earns the closing stance and shows cost. Minor limitation: secondary figures (constable, uncle, auntie) are sketched with symbolic clarity more than full interior nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “rediscover lost joy, not a museum of ache”—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially the late renunciation of hoarding the past. Interiority is richly embodied in how she engages with tools (lanterns, projectors, jam) and setting, rather than abstract labels. The internal conflict between restoration and letting-go surfaces convincingly when the fog starts to “keep all stories” and she chooses to blur the display. A slight limitation is that we glimpse little of her flaw or blind spot beyond that central tension, keeping the arc just shy of fully multi-dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The restorer’s interiority is distinctive and coherent: listening-as-craft, the heirloom coin, and the choice to filter out tonality all root in a believable temperament. Motivation (“to exchange certainty for curiosity”) is dramatized through tactics—asking a question, clapping softly, tuning the console rather than forcing meaning. Internal conflict is subtle but present in the tension between wanting an answer and refusing to “fall into answers.” The change at the end—leaving the coin and accepting ordinariness as sufficient—feels earned, though the emotional cost remains quiet rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to stand guard over your own spark of defiance”) is clear and consistent, and Ilya is sharply etched through action and speech. However, interiority remains relatively cool and distanced; we rarely see the narrator’s contradictory impulses under acute pressure, especially during the collectors’ visit. Ilya’s charm/roguishness shows in behavior but isn’t deeply stress-tested. The piece lands more on emblematic, role-based characterization than fully embodied psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The insomniac poet has a clear, particular motive (“to photosynthesize pain into beauty”) and their choices—following the map, convening the blossoms, insisting edges can remain without blood—are consistent and revealing. Interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthetic images (“I drink the dark and exhale petals”), with insomnia and ache functioning as ongoing flaws rather than solved problems. Internal contradiction (compelled to keep vigil vs. longing for peace and rest) is present but could be sharpened in the negotiation itself. Secondary characters (Guard of Petals, blossoms-as-factions) exert real but brief pressure rather than becoming full relational crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The caretaker’s motive—to preserve forgotten names—runs cleanly through every action, and her choice not to mend the cracked chime is a precise, character-driven turn. Interiority is mostly embodied in image (“foxglove regret,” exhaustion under the mezzanine) rather than abstract labels, which works well in this register. There is a credible evolution from solitary, dutiful archivist to someone who consciously embraces damage as part of preservation, with cost in fatigue and lingering regret. The only limitation is emotional distance: her contradictions (duty vs. regret) are felt but remain slightly idealized rather than messily human.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (repairing the relationship vs. retreating into scholarship) are clear and consistently dramatized, and the micro-choices—returning, admitting the “vanishing,” proposing vows—track believably with those traits. Interiority is specific and embodied through objects (the ink well, the parchment) rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Mara works as the crucible: her guarded willingness and pointed lines (“You forgot this,” “You came back”) push the narrator into costlier honesty. The one limitation is that the inner conflict resolves a bit smoothly; there’s little on-page backsliding or real risk of failure once the vows begin.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The machinist’s motives and inner life are rich and specific—the tension between “math and mercy,” the mentor’s influence, and the ethical care embedded in their craft all read as lived rather than generic. Micro-choices (bringing the envelope, choosing to explain the schedule via story, leaving tools behind) reveal a clear value hierarchy. Internal contradiction exists but is gentle rather than harrowing; there’s little sense of genuine risk of failure or moral misstep. The closing shift to a steadier heartbeat is earned, but the cost of that steadiness remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—to protect herself and others from the dangers of traceable communication while still craving connection—is vivid, specific, and consistent, with Ezra’s request pressing precisely on that old wound. The Mara backstory is concrete and dramatized enough that her trauma feels earned, not decorative. Contradictory impulses (urge to refuse vs. attic “asking” otherwise; wanting safety vs. wanting the song carried) are present in scene and culminate coherently in her choice to send Thimble. If anything, the emotional cost of reopening to Ezra at the end could be underlined with one sharper embodied beat to hit absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to understand the father’s disappearance and the “sacred” nature of thresholds—is clear, specific, and drives every on-page choice. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“stubborn with love”), revealing contradiction between resentment and longing. The final act of crossing the cedar frame feels earned by the preceding decoding and emotional groundwork, with a legible cost in how she reframes his leaving. The only small limitation is that the father remains mostly an idea rather than a fully embodied on-page presence, which slightly narrows relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and longing (“I had come to listen because I had never belonged…”) are vivid and consistent, and the final choice to stay feels earned by their accumulated experience with Mara and the city. However, internal conflict rarely sharpens into true contradiction or difficult trade-offs; doubt is mentioned but quickly soothed rather than dramatized. Mara is atmospheric and specific but functions mainly as a gentle guide, not a source of pressure. The endurance/renunciation at the end is emotionally credible but carries only a lightly felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and sensibility are vivid and specific, and their motive—to understand disappearing paths—stays consistent and active. However, interior conflict is relatively gentle: the “cheerful as a bruise” conjecture suggests tension between protection and access, but that contradiction isn’t pushed very hard. The emotional arc is more contemplative than pressured, so the final promise to “keep what matters from turning to silence” feels earned but not costly. Micro-choices (following threads, negotiating with the bird) do reveal values, yet we rarely see the narrator genuinely torn.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The performer is sharply etched as a mind that worships efficiency and pattern, and the woman in the green coat is sketched with just enough detail (spreadsheets, “diagonals”) to feel like a real counterpoint. Motivation—“serenade monotony with creativity, but never with wasteful flourish”—is clear and governs his choices. However, interior conflict is minimal; he never seems genuinely torn or under emotional strain, so the final act of giving her the bishop, while lovely, carries modest felt cost. Relationships and status dynamics are present but stay gentle rather than crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific, with exile, loyalty to the tides, and defiance braided into every micro-choice. Her decision to risk the clerk and then invite him into “elective exile from certainty” feels fully motivated by her established values. The clerk’s shift from enforcer to participant is fast but grounded in on-page doubt (“if forgetting can be gentle”) and his embodied hesitation with the glove. There’s genuine cost in both characters stepping away from sanctioned roles, even if the external penalties remain off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glazier’s characterization is rich, specific, and consistent, with his craft, reticence (“my tongue is better with putty than petitions”), and ritual giving him a distinctive interior life. Motivation—to preserve overlooked value—clearly drives his choices in how he engages the harbor master. Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle (quiet artisan forced into a quasi-advocacy role), so the crucible is more soft than searing. The harbor master’s shift feels believable and grounded in what they witness together.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The firefighter’s guilt, competence, and desire to “translate pain” are specific and embodied in how he handles the box, remembers the owls, and speaks to Mira. His internal contradiction—pragmatic triage vs. grief over what he sacrificed—remains active through the scene and credibly motivates his final vow. The relationship with Mira works as crucible rather than romance; her questions sharpen his self-accounting and help crystallize his new stance. The closing hinge-image (“this time opening both directions”) feels earned by prior causal beats, with a visible emotional cost in accepting he can never undo the owls’ loss.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to derive “equations for hope” that can help a spiritually thinned village—stays clear and grows into communal responsibility, and the late move of naming themself a variable is an earned and affecting self-implication. Internal conflict is subtle but present: a bias toward method and neatness vs. the risk of vulnerability and relational exchange. However, the emotional texture remains serenely controlled throughout; we don’t see many messy or contradictory impulses under pressure, which keeps the psychological depth just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives—honoring the family craft while questioning its ethics—are clear and sharpen across the story, culminating in the choice to “rechart the echo” into mercy. Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than labeled, and the conflict between reverence for legacy and refusal to perpetuate harm is credibly dramatized. The final stance shift (legacy as “listening, not law”) is well earned by the earlier discoveries about the grandmother and the trapped man. A slightly deeper, more bodily registration of guilt or ambivalence at the core revelation could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The painter and Lio are distinct, memorable figures with clear motives (possibility vs loss), and the painter’s ethics around “possibility, not promise” adds welcome complexity. However, both are rendered at a mythic distance with minimal interior contradiction or embodied emotion; Lio’s grief and hope are implied more than dramatized. The relationship dynamic—painter inviting Lio’s “beat”—is strong but a bit under-pressured. The city as quasi-character is evocative, yet its transformation is more conceptual than felt through specific, conflicted individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The negotiator is sharply etched: competent, morally compromised, and bearing a specific prior harm (“the ambush I greenlit once…”) that directly informs tonight’s risk. Interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied details like the reed across the tongue and the weight of the clipboard making vows and guilt felt, not abstract. Contradictory impulses—duty to peace vs. complicity, self-preservation vs. willingness to lose her voice and role—are dramatized in scene. The final renunciation vow is fully earned by what we’ve learned of her history and values.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s amoral pragmatism and buried sentimentality are braided cleanly into motive and choice, culminating in the “narrower grace” compromise instead of the full release. Interiority is specific to their status and worldview (“I endow what the market tolerates, then sell back the virtues stamped with my name”). The internal conflict between ledger and mercy is live on the page, not summarized. The final sense of belonging to the chick gives a credible, costly tilt rather than a tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s motivation (“to defy the lullaby of conformity”) is clear, rooted in her chaste practice and refusal of transactional touch, and her micro-choices (keeping others’ whispers, unbraiding the city’s braid) align with that ethic. Her interiority is particular and embodied, especially in the way her abstinence becomes “a blade of absence sharper than desire.” The primary gap is a relative softness of on-page struggle: once she identifies the story-lock and the city’s braid, she overcomes them without much visible doubt, fear, or temptation to stop. The final endurance—accepting a widened, more burdensome purpose—reads earned but could land with sharper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Aurel’s interiority is specific and textured—“urbane calligrapher,” “hive of second thoughts,” outward serenity vs. internal agitation—and his ethical blind spot is clearly dramatized through action (carrying the stick, planning manipulative shows, then halting the launch). The shift from unilateral control to apologizing and co-writing rules feels earned and costs him ego and authority. Ferro and Miri are thinner but still individualized through a few telling gestures (Ferro’s coin-weighing gaze, Miri’s relation to the stick, Ferro inviting the moth). The relationship dynamic—trust strained, then renegotiated with explicit new rules—works credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—to honor overlooked histories and accompany the last monarch—is specific, coherent, and carried through concrete micro-choices (the triangle’s orientation, refusing to “make a god of guidance,” collapsing the frames). Interiority is rich and particular (“esoteric realist,” raised by workers, grandmother learning from seed sacks). The main limitation is that internal conflict remains relatively gentle; we don’t see much real risk of failure or serious temptation to do otherwise. Still, the final endurance/vow reads earned and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (preserving forgotten names, working through survivor’s guilt) is clear, specific, and consistently drives each choice, from entering the sanctum to risking the last braid. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“snowmelt ardor rushed through my chest”), with the craft identity (lost wax caster) deeply integrated into thought and action rather than as label. The internal conflict—self-accusation versus the need to act—is present but could surface in sharper, in-the-moment contradiction at the peak (she never truly seems in danger of turning back). The ending endurance choice (staying to keep the bellows awake) feels earned and costs her an implied outside life, though that cost could be made a touch more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Only’s motivation—to learn whether the path still “wants” them—is clear and consistently pressures their choices, and the internal shift from lonely designation (“Only”) to shared movement is earned. Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory metaphors rather than labels. There is a quiet internal conflict between fear of being discarded and desire for partnership, though it could surface in a slightly more dramatized, less conceptual way. Overall the character reads distinct and coherent within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astronomer’s frugality, “piety with proofs,” and hunger for a covenant yield a coherent, particular psychology that motivates every action. Internal contradiction is nicely embodied when “the evidence had led exactly to a gesture of faith,” showing rationalism and devotion straining against each other. His micro-choices—aligning sums to claws, whispering numbers as vows, asking the unknown to “uncloak only what a careful heart can keep”—all reveal a stable value hierarchy. The only limitation is that the character arc is more a deepening than a sharp transformation, so the cost of his final stance is felt but relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s mix of pacifist intent and unreleased rage is sharply rendered, and Mara’s hardness overlaying buried compassion (“unsure whether to draw empathy like a dagger or put both away”) gives her real dimensionality. The cellular-memory ritual externalizes their internal conflicts in embodied, specific ways. Mara’s shift from siege-mindset to accepting withdrawal feels earned rather than abrupt, with visible cost in pride and identity. A slight brush with quasi-therapeutic language (“cellular memory”) is fully dramatized, so it doesn’t undercut the emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Iren’s motive—capturing his dead wife’s dream to revive the orchard—is clear, particular, and consistently drives his choices, especially in how he bargains with the dream (“he could recreate its sky without bars”). His groundedness under pressure (breath work, counting mummified apples) reads as embodied competence rather than abstraction. Internal contradiction (capture vs. not trapping; truth vs. “polished show”) is present but mostly implied, not deeply dramatized in moment-to-moment conflict. The neighbors only appear at the end, so relationships don’t significantly pressure or transform him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives (mend the breach, honor guild ethics, bridge generations, process his daughter’s leaving) are clear and consistently expressed through specific choices like using the ribbon and engaging the kids. Interiority is rich and particular (“a terrible clamp but a wonderful reminder of pressure and gentleness”) and emotions are embodied through tools, guild language, and plant metaphors rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but quiet—more a low-grade ache than sharp contradiction—so the arc is more deepening of stance than hard turn. The endurance at the end feels earned, but the piece never quite forces him into a truly fraught trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interior life is rich, specific, and embodied (“brightened disquiet humming in my ribs”), and the narrator’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. fear of self-entrapment—are dramatized rather than explained. The core turn (refusing to take the named fruit and instead re-purposing the cameo) feels earned by earlier unease about self-cataloging and nonlinear inheritance. The relationship with the past heir is brief but vivid and reframes the narrator’s role without collapsing into sentimentality. A slight softness is that we don’t quite see the personal cost of the new stance beyond intellectual repositioning; the loss of a defined lineage could be shaded a touch more.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivations and traits (“carefully resourceful,” drawn to the library of unlearned lessons) are specific and consistently dramatized, and their choices at the contract scenes feel earned. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with concepts like “researching gaps” and “storyblood” revealing worldview under pressure. The internal conflict—duty to rescue versus desire to offload or confront personal refusals—is present but could surface more sharply in the climax. The time traveler remains more emblematic than fully realized, but he does enough work as a foil to the narrator’s competence and self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and particular, rooted in the specific wound of the erased name and the vocation of “recaptur[ing] the lost.” The chimera-twin premise becomes emotionally concrete once the twin steps out of the mirrors and shares the final task, giving the internal split real on-page presence. Motivation is coherent from start (seeking the garden) through costed closure (retelling “the worst part together”). The only limit is that contradictory impulses—fear vs. compulsion, resistance vs. need—could surface more explicitly in a few key beats for even sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archivist’s motivation and temperament are crystal-clear, and the occupational lens (“adaptable archivist,” “warmly methodical”) feels specific and lived-in. Her choices—to trust the impossible door, to interpret the braid as instruction, to aim for “alignment” rather than force—are all rooted in those traits. What’s missing for the very top band is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or emotional cost; she never feels truly torn or at risk. The endurance/change at the end reads as deepening of an already-stable stance rather than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and motive (“to find the quiet in the storm”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—following the hush, setting the stone on the drum, waiting until the promise holds—track clearly with that drive. The internal shift from mistaking quiet as absence to understanding it as lattice is well-earned and anchored in concrete experience. However, internal conflict is more stated than dramatized; we rarely feel contradictory impulses in the moment, only the before/after of her understanding. The emotional cost of failure (for her personally, not just “travelers”) stays somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kera’s motivation—to rekindle the beacon and prove coincidences have meaning—is clear, specific, and drives every choice, from taking the risk of mending the prism to decoding and answering the flare. Her interiority is textured (cautious hope, disciplined attention, refusal to curse), though more embodied emotional contradiction under peak pressure could deepen her. The retrocognitive gift personalizes how she relates to the beacon, not just as a job but as a charged relic. The final stance—choosing to “call them home” and embrace purpose—is earned and forecloses the safer path of staying in ritualistic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s motivation—to “sculpt identity from experience” while fearing dissolution into the collective—is clear, specific, and consistently pressures her choices. The flaw of being “preemptively nostalgic” is well dramatized as both burden and skill, especially in her reluctance to relinquish memories to the city. Internal conflict (hold vs. give, self vs. choir) is sustained and culminates credibly in the decision to leave a “braid of moments.” The only limiter is that all this conflict stays in a relatively narrow emotional register; we never see a truly destabilizing counter-impulse that might tempt her to refuse the collective entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s and Mara’s motives are clear, specific, and rooted in hurt (defying hopelessness; coaxing a vanished cousin home), and their choices consistently serve those drives. The story gives Lio a convincing professional interiority—his “decision by sensing” and careful measuring under pressure feel lived-in. Emotional contradiction is present but understated: his grin masking ache, serious playfulness that coexists with grief. The main limitation is that we rarely see his resolve genuinely falter or collide with a contrary impulse on the page, so the internal conflict remains low-key rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistently filtered through their tidal-pool sensibility, and their ambivalence about staying/leaving feels deeply rooted in character rather than imposed theme. Contradictory impulses—love for the shared shore, fear of the decision, a near-compulsive observational stance—are in play simultaneously. The relationship dynamic is legible even with the other character mostly silent: their fear of the answer, history as teacher, and mutual tenderness underpin the stakes. The final stance (refusing a binary decision but committing to “cross this mouth of water with you”) is well earned and clearly costs certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s claustrophobia, bunker upbringing, and trellis ritual create a specific, embodied psychology; micro-choices like “keeping the doll a nail’s width” and “limiting exposure” under pressure feel particular and credible. Contradictory impulses—needing silence yet fearing it, resenting the bunker yet honoring the father—operate simultaneously rather than in tidy sequence. The final revaluation of the father (“He gilded his hush… and I have mistaken the metal for the cage”) is earned by prior beats of memory and bodily panic. Emotional texture stays concrete (ribs fencing, walls sprinting in) rather than abstract or diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The operator’s interiority is specific and grounded in his practiced craft; his patience, attention, and “fluidly logical” mind consistently drive micro-choices (adjusting swing, dimming light, re-routing past the glass orchard). The mother and girl are sketched with economical but vivid specificity, and their grief behaviors (clutching photo, ringing bell like a rope) feel embodied. The emotional shift—from the girl’s alarmed ringing to the bell “sleeping in a pocket” and the mother’s exhale—reads as earned endurance/reconfiguration rather than a neat cure. The only limiting factor is that the operator’s own internal contradictions (cost of this vocation, any personal ache) remain implied rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maris’s motivation—protecting a human-centered throne and honoring her grandmother’s charge—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from leaving the Archives to trusting the murals and root-room. The interiority is specific (“cooled when I pretended I knew what I was doing”) and embodied, not abstract. Internal conflict is present but mild; hesitation and fear are gestured to via ancestors who hesitated, but Maris never truly struggles with the decision to claim stewardship. The final act of placing her palm on the throne is earned but could register a sharper felt cost or contradiction to land in a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Keeper’s motivation and boundaries are clear and specific—“to teach suffocating to breathe without giving back the knives it craved” is an excellent, character-particular line. The tension between tenderness and ruthless self‑protection gives the narrator credible internal conflict. The visitor is more archetypal than individuated, but their shame and hesitation (“staying felt like drowning disguised as patience”) still read embodied and real. The final act of giving away the ring and accepting ongoing solitude feels earned by the prior stance on burned bridges.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s history as a pyramid scheme survivor and their current vow “never [to] sell crushing again” give them a specific, credible psychology that drives every major choice. Volunteering for the chamber, pocketing the bolt, and dedicating the bead to the workers fund all align with this mix of guilt, idealism, and stubbornness. Interiority is vivid and particular (“sprouted from bad math and worse promises”), not generic. The internal conflict between exploiting pressure and transforming it into solidarity pays off cleanly in the closing commitment to “grow a network that is not a pyramid.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—reluctant abdicator, family guilt, curiosity, and duty all co-exist credibly (“Even mercy carries a noose when history needs a neck”). The narrator’s choices (coming to the room, agreeing to the archivist’s odd request, persisting in listening/decoding, leaving with the tin rather than seeking power) are consistent with those traits. Internal conflict is present but quiet; there’s less on-page struggle at the peak than there could be. The final endurance/renunciation—accepting the role of listener rather than ruler—feels earned and carries a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The knight’s motives and arc are clear and specific: from “not for glory, but to capture the shape of possibility” to divesting his armor and pledging to the orchard. His interior conflict between old martial oaths and this new, quieter allegiance is dramatized through concrete choices (unsnapping visor, letting orchard “unsnap” the rest). The main limitation is that his past and flaws are sketched archetypally rather than with highly individuating detail, which keeps him just short of indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is specific and credible, with a clear governing motive (“magnify small kindnesses”) that consistently shapes perception and behavior. The ethical tension between preserving privacy and returning the button is well-drawn, especially in the choice not to read the note but to note “be warm.” Emotional experience is embodied through archival metaphors rather than stock feeling words. The only minor limitation is that conflict stays mostly conceptual; we don’t see the character pushed into more self-implicating contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Jessa’s motivation—to preserve memory against state erasure—is clear, consistent, and drives each concrete choice from using the key to risking exposure at the lagoon. Her competence and “careful resourcefulness” are well dramatized in how she moves through the environment and handles the relay. What’s thinner is on-page contradiction or emotional wobble under pressure; she rarely falters or reveals a conflicted interior, which keeps her just short of fully three-dimensional. The relationship with the contact is functional rather than crucible-like, but his jeopardy still meaningfully pressures her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motive—to hush the prophecy and protect the town—is clear, consistent, and deepened by his earlier temptation toward applause. Interiority is specific and character-particular, filtered through musical and fog imagery rather than stock emotion labels. Internal conflict between wanting to play/shine and choosing self-effacing silence is credible and culminates in the “ledger of mercy” without praise. Embodied emotion is present but more metaphorical than physical, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fen’s vocation, habits, and reverence for order are rendered with specific, idiosyncratic detail, and his central conflict—store versus release—is clearly rooted in who he is (“his catalogues were towers in his mind, careful barns of feeling”). His ultimate renunciation feels earned by the accumulated pattern of listening and arranging. Emotional texture is rich if mostly implicit; a touch more embodied doubt or fear in the release moment could deepen the sense of cost. Still, the transformation reads credible and character-driven rather than purely thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to move from control to “befriending uncertainty”—is clear, consistent, and deepens as the compass demands risk (descending into the cistern, leaving the rose behind). Interiority is specific and embodied (“tested each step with a watchmaker's patience and a pilgrim's doubt”), not generic. The final endurance choice—to live as steward of this uncertain timing rather than reclaim the compass—reads earned and forecloses a return to his old life. Internal contradiction (fear vs. pull toward uncertainty) is present, though it could surface even more sharply in one or two moments of near-refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific, textured, and deeply tied to craft and guilt; we understand why they accept the father’s charge and how their perfectionism functions as both virtue and flaw. The internal conflict between “balance” and love is dramatized in lines like “What if I misnamed her wildness as disobedience, my own balance as safety, my safety as love.” The final choice—to offer a flawed, honest token and accept the father’s hatred—feels earned by the preceding moral calculus. The only small limitation is that all relational pressure is off-stage, so status and dynamic with the father are mediated rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s characterization is vivid and specific—“lost soul collector,” “modestly fearless,” haunted by the man he didn’t save and the widow’s laugh. Motivation to find and repurpose a particular laugh is clear and consistent, and interiority is rich without drifting into therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (guilt, tenderness, wariness toward joy) are dramatized through choices like detuning further and offering his worst memory first. The only constraint on a higher score is that, while the inner conflict is strong, the piece leans slightly more on lyric declaration than dramatized struggle at one or two peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is psychologically specific and embodied, with trauma responses (“my wrists try to twist apart”) functioning as both characterization and plot device. Motivation—to test this ‘upgrade’ against the possibility of mercy—is clear and consistent. Contradictory impulses (need for equations vs. distrust of prayer and memory) play out credibly in micro-choices like looping the strap but not tightening it. The final renunciation (leaving the strap, walking toward ordinariness) feels earned and carries a visible cost in relinquishing a charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—to honor overlooked labor—remains clear, consistent, and credibly rooted in the lighthouse fragment and family lineage. Interiority is specific and embodied through how they perceive light, ropes, and names, rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (reverence vs. the risk of “remembering what the city prefers forgetting”) rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of pressure on their choices. The elder functions more as a catalyst and witness than a full crucible relationship, but his presence does sharpen the narrator’s role as translator.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—to uncover what ceilings hide for the ghosts and for himself—is coherent and consistent, and his professional competence is well dramatized in how he reads dust, mechanisms, and hatches. Interiority is specific and filtered through an elevator-tech/ghost-seer worldview (“Elevators teach the truth of loads and escapes, and ghosts teach patience with what lingers.”). The ghosts apply gentle but real pressure, especially the girl and the watchmaker, though their roles are more catalytic than truly oppositional. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page clash of contradictory impulses in the narrator at the peak; he never seems deeply torn, only quietly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The operator’s motive—“to compress eternity into a moment”—is specific, persistent, and meaningfully tested by the dangerous choice to loosen the press beyond regulation. Interiority is vivid and particular, especially when the frost patterns are recognized as the very gesture once failed, tying grief and craft into one flaw. The relationship with the Glasswright gives a clear status dynamic (her warning versus their compulsion) that sharpens the choice without reducing her to a foil. The final act reads as an earned, costly attempt to repair that old failure rather than a sudden epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Neris is sharply realized: a “defunct revolutionary” whose custodial role and poetic temperament create a strong, specific interior lens. Her motives are clear and consistent—she wants the verdict to redeem a civilization and, by extension, her own failed ideals—and her tactics (the calibration, the framing of kneeling as strategy) grow naturally from that. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: a would‑be revolutionary operating through legal ritual and aesthetic argument rather than direct action. The closing image of her “defunct heart” considering revolt again feels earned by the tribunal’s events rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The repairman’s motives (reclaiming dawn; aversion to dishonesty) are crisp, embodied, and consistently drive his choices, especially in bowing to the rust covenant yet refusing to abandon the children. The internal tension between respecting balance and intervening anyway is clear, though his struggle could sharpen with one more moment of genuine doubt or risk. His emotional texture feels specific—“wilts near dishonesty” is dramatized with the constable’s smile and the elders’ confession. The arc from solitary craftsman to someone willing to violate doctrine for light reads earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s motivation—to find the place where explanations fail—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro-choices (buying the compass, using psychometry, tying the cord, taking one vial). “Sensibly eccentric” is nicely dramatized in the tension between curiosity and caution rather than left as a label. Interiority is particular and embodied (heat in calves, fingertip nerves, the hum at the seam), though outright contradiction in impulses is relatively subtle. The final stance as “caretaker… returning with a vial and an empty case” feels earned and closes off the path of pure scientific or exploitative extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, habits, and lineage (grandmother lighthouse keeper) create a distinct, embodied psyche, and her choices—to follow gulls, to work with the arch, to shift from solitary art to communal shelter—are well motivated. Interiority is textured and idiosyncratic (“tastes like bitten nails”), with emotions shown through perception and craft rather than labels. The arc from lone sculptor-deliverer to someone intent on convening others is clear and earned. What keeps this just below the top tier is the relative lack of sharp internal contradiction under pressure; she adapts almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—ostensibly to paint, secretly to understand the night-blooming flowers and how to “speak without harm”—is clear, specific, and sustained. Interiority is textured and embodied through attention to glass, petals, and color restraint rather than abstract labels. The internal shift from seeking knowledge to seeking a gentler mode of offering is well-earned by prior images and choices. The only ceiling is that we never see contradictory impulses clash in a single, pressured moment; the struggle remains consistently quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s vocation, ethics, and quiet ruthlessness about truth are sharply rendered, and Esteban’s mixture of guilt, pragmatism, and loyalty feels specific and human. The promise to “keep his contradictions intact” is a strong crucible moment that reveals both of them. Internal conflict is present but mostly articulated in thematic language rather than dramatized through a concrete, on-page hesitation or misstep. A touch more embodied struggle at the key promise beat would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistent: repudiating wishcraft by rebuilding a civilization through constraint and work. His choices—discarding comfort, erasing the shale plan, refusing to name miracles—align tightly with that motive. The endurance at the end (quietly accepting collaborators and continuing the method) feels like an Earned Stasis with cost in solitude and effort. A slight limitation is the relative lack of on-page inner contradiction; his stance is steadfast rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, temperament, and ethical code are sharply drawn and consistently motivate every action, from the meticulous cleaning of the shaving to the final choice to witness rather than bind. Internal conflict is vivid and specific (archivist vs participant, knife vs sheath) and plays out in concrete micro-choices. The recognition of his own cadence in the grooves elegantly externalizes self-implication without resorting to abstract labels. The final refusal to “be part of the weather” while accepting complicity reads as an earned, costly stance rather than a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—duty to the ark and a personal hunger to “discover the texture of borrowed time”—is specific, persistent, and cleanly tied to their actions. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“furiously tranquil,” “careful ferocities”) without sliding into diagnostic language. The main limitation is that internal conflict stays low-key; they rarely hesitate or doubt, so we see fewer contradictory impulses under pressure. The final acceptance of vow and passing on of the cap still reads as an earned stance rather than a convenient beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethos (“favor listening over noise”), and competence under pressure are vivid and consistent, and the final refusal to trigger the sirens feels fully earned. Interiority is concrete and filtered through tools and weather rather than abstracted feeling words. The main missing piece, keeping this just shy of the very top band, is sharper on-page friction between competing impulses (career risk vs. devotion to quiet) at the moment of decision; it’s implied rather than dramatized in felt contradiction. Still, the cumulative micro-choices around sensors, glue, and mufflers build a convincing, particular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The janitor’s interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent, with his grief, tenderness for machines, and chosen humility all aligning with his actions. His decision to risk exposing his private ritual to the salvage crew is a clear, motivated turn with emotional cost. Internal contradiction (wanting both solitude and connection, endurance and surrender) is woven through rather than told. Secondary characters are lightly sketched but function well as pressures rather than fully developed individuals, which is appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interior is specific and consistent: an “astonished recluse” whose impulse is to listen and carry unspoken weight rather than interpret it. Her choices—opening the box, arranging the hives, performing the wordless ritual, refusing to translate—are well motivated by that sensibility. Internal contradiction (her urge to understand vs. her refusal to break the covenant by speaking) is present but remains subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The ghosts function more as atmospheric witnesses than as active relational pressure, which slightly limits the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motive—to understand and steward the “texture of time”—is clear, particular, and consistently embodied in their perceptions. Micro-choices (preparing via adjective-maps, bringing Mara, releasing the borrowed coins) are all rooted in that motive. Internal contradiction is present but muted; the debt-payment decision lands without much visible resistance or irrationality, softening the sense of struggle. Mara and her grandmother are evocative but lightly drawn, serving function more than full relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives (“to discover beauty in the incomplete”) are specific and drive every choice, especially rising to help and sacrificing the quill-feather. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (“string sings, high and thin like a violinist testing”), with subtle internal tension between quiet observation and intervention. The boy and father are more simply drawn but still individuated through behavior and small emotional beats. The final renunciation of the feather’s first role and the acceptance of an imperfect kite feel earned and carry a quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The caretaker’s motives (legacy transmuted into interspecies respect under a death sentence) are clear, consistent, and particular, and her actions—redrawing paths, wiring trees, proposing a pact—arise cleanly from them. Interiority is textured and idiosyncratic rather than generic. The main limitation is that internal contradiction and visible emotional cost stay muted; the terminal illness frames her stance but is not sharply dramatized in on-page moments of doubt or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “luminous skeptic” and “academically rebellious” is specific, internally coherent, and expressed through choices (designing the unruly pilgrimage, refusing the lab bench alone). Interiority is vivid and embodied in sensory/scientific attention rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is that internal conflict never faces a truly sharp on-page cost; doubt and yearning harmonize rather than grind against each other under pressure. Still, the final acceptance of “exchange constant” homecoming reads as an earned, character-driven reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coachman’s vocation, guilt, and patient devotion are vivid and specific, and his micro-choices (where to plant, what to offer the veteran) track cleanly with his mission. Interiority is mostly embedded in image and metaphor rather than explicit conflict, so contradictory impulses (weariness vs duty, faith vs doubt) stay implied rather than dramatized. The veteran’s brief appearance still lands emotionally and reveals the coachman’s values under pressure. The piece leans toward emblematic rather than fully dramatized psychology, which slightly limits the ceiling at this elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Character motivation is clean and compelling—the drive to find the brother and “translate distance into closeness” is specific and consistently dramatized, with Gable as a poignant extension of that desire. The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied through perception rather than label-speak, and micro-choices (trusting the trader, experimenting with the phonograph, using the leaf, following the riddles) all track. However, internal contradiction is mostly implied rather than dramatized in scene; we don’t see a strong moment of resisting or doubting the quest. The brother remains idealized and exists largely as a voice of wisdom, so the relational crucible leans more toward elegy than active, pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to stay behind and “turn confusion into exploration”—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from refusing evacuation to rerouting the lens. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (the mother, the compass rose, the family custom), with a believable mix of pride, hurt, and scientific devotion. The pariah status provides a credible, felt cost that the character accepts rather than resolves. Internal conflict is more tonal than sharply dramatized, but the final stance (staying, sending the pattern, needing no applause) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Both Kestrel and the narrator are sharply etched through choices—Kestrel’s “chivalrous” thefts and his confession about the compass maker, the narrator’s stated fear and repeated recommitments to wonder. Internal conflict (fear vs curiosity) is concretely tested (“fear was a doorway I longed to open”) and paid off in the final stance. The relationship dynamic—his sacred playfulness against her earnest apprenticeship—acts as a crucible and evolves credibly. Depth is strong for the length, though true moral messiness and irrational backsliding are only briefly touched.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—comfort in scripted danger vs. need to face unscripted harm—are sharply rendered and drive both the stakes and the final stance (“the pretending did not help but it gave me a grammar”). Interiority is specific, embodied, and particular, with concrete markers like the ladder of scars and the memory of torn sleeves. Motivation evolves credibly from survival to the chosen, costly role of “historian of small gestures.” The Custodian’s pressure is clear but her own inner life remains mostly emblematic, which slightly limits the relational crucible dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) is vivid and consistent, and their fear of the old address versus desire for belonging produces a credible, if quiet, internal conflict. The cost of having mistaken hiding for shelter is thematically and emotionally legible, especially in “I realize my buried talents are not skills but permissions.” The seer is distinct, pressuring yet compassionate, with a coherent worldview that pushes the protagonist into risk. If there’s a limitation, it’s that the narrator’s interiority, while rich, sometimes stays at an abstract/metaphoric level rather than showing a few more concrete, idiosyncratic tells under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tutor’s guilt, self-exile, and disciplined, chess-like mind all read as specific and coherent, and his final act of tying the thread to his own wrist is fully motivated by the preceding interior struggle. Contradictory impulses—his desire to self-punish vs. his emerging commitment to mercy—are present in scene, not just summarized. The emotional journey from exile-as-penance to accepting continued life as a teacher of “the opening called mercy” feels earned and costly. A hair more embodied, less abstracted emotion at the peak choice could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives (grief over the sister, anger at the “single story,” desire to change the price of forgiveness) are specific, coherent, and enacted through concrete tactics. Interiority is vivid and character-particular, with good contradiction (mischief as both play and weapon). The elders are more symbolic than individuated, but that fits the fable-like frame without undermining pressure. The final act of public defiance feels well-earned by prior behavior and values.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to repair the engine and salvage meaning in the face of eroding acid and doubt—is clear and consistent, and his final sacrifice of the charm is well-earned. Interiority is vivid and particular (e.g., “quilts memories together from scraps of notebooks”), giving him a distinct emotional texture. Internal contradiction (fear vs. stubborn intention) is present but remains relatively subtle and could be sharpened in on-page moments of near-refusal. Still, his micro-choices under pressure track cleanly and culminate in a credible, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The painter’s motivation—fulfilling a private promise “to find a place where paint could hold time”—is clear, specific, and drives every major choice. Interiority is textured and particular (“friendly and distant…a contradiction I wore like salt”), and the final acceptance of being “held and released” reads as an earned stance rather than a tidy epiphany. The internal conflict between yearning for preservation and acceptance of erasure is present but could surface more as live, in-the-moment contradiction under pressure rather than as retrospective poise. Relationship pressure is mostly abstract (mother, townspeople, “people called me…”), which slightly limits the crucible for change.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivations—both to save Mara and to vindicate his philosophy of whispers—are clear, embodied, and consistently drive his choices, especially in refusing Alder’s horn. Interiority is rich and particular (“as if ushering a child past sleeping dogs”), and small micro-choices (when to speak, when to hold back touch) reveal values. Alder and Mara are sketched efficiently yet distinctly; Alder’s resistance and grudging mirroring give the relationship real texture. The final softening—“his eyes have the look of someone hearing a lullaby from the wrong century”—feels earned rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, history, and relationship with Rowan are sharply etched through concrete tasks and talismanic objects (the censer foot, the patched coat). Motivation—to guide people through “the geography of loss”—is consistently dramatized in the work with callers, not just stated. Internal conflict is quieter but present in choices like not asking if the house still stands, emphasizing duty over personal craving. A slightly deeper flash of self-contradiction under peak pressure could push this toward absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives (rationalism vs. need for mercy in truth) are clear, and the tension between method and contraband gives them a credible internal conflict. The involuntary truthfulness plus scientific mindset creates a distinctive, consistent personality. The burial of the eye is a well-earned stance rather than a neat epiphany. There could be slightly more embodied emotional texture under peak pressure, especially when the courier reclaims the eye.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The keeper’s motivation—to decode and deliver the dead man’s gesture—is clear, consistent, and organically intensified by his self-description as someone who “trusted what was missing more than what showed.” His interiority is particular and embodied in perception (e.g., “the darkness between beams”) rather than labels. The enduring choice to keep signaling after Mira’s apparent receipt reads as an Earned Stasis that forecloses a simpler, unburdened solitude. Internal contradiction (content in isolation yet craving purpose via others’ unfinished gestures) is implied rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this just short of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elias’s motivations are clear, specific, and continuous—from the lingering promise to his sister through the pull toward the “doorway of decisions” and finally to opening his shop as shelter. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (calipers and hunches, typesetter father, the naming of loneliness as an “error”). The final change—choosing engagement and responsibility—feels earned by the accumulated pattern of drifting and the promise. The only slight limitation is that his internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in moment-to-moment contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The queen’s motivation—relief from the “recurring dreams of bleeding starlight” and an atonement for the coronation fire—is coherent and drives every choice, culminating in her renunciation (“I unmake my unmaking”). Interiority is conveyed through image rather than explicit thought, but her contradictions (disenchanted yet still commanding, unflinching yet clearly haunted) are legible. The mapmaker functions mainly as a respectful witness, offering little counter-pressure beyond quiet support. Emotional embodiment could occasionally move beyond atmosphere into more body-specific or situational detail under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “capture the density of presence”—is vivid, particular, and consistently embodied in choices, from carrying the reactor to reweighting coefficients in chalk. The relationship with Lio is tender and specific, with details like the wrist signal and the mint-and-books breath giving the bond texture. Internal contradiction is quieter: the tension between measurement and mystery is present but mostly articulated rather than dramatized in competing impulses. The final stance (science as precise romance, metrics without loss of wonder) feels earned, though the emotional cost of Lio’s vulnerability could be sharpened further on the narrator’s side.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with jealousy, awe, and weariness all coexisting in credible tension (“If I am to be a tomb and a mouth…”). Motivation—to keep the ledger and make meaning out of chaos—underlies micro-choices like interrogating jealousy, consulting dream selves, and returning to the grave. The council of past selves is a sharp dramatization of internal conflict with distinct, if symbolic, personas. The only small limit is that the emotional cost of this vocation could be pushed into one more concrete, embodied moment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator, Isidor, and the midwife all feel specific and individuated, with the anosmic aromatherapist’s sensory reorientation giving the voice real particularity. The midwife’s mix of pride, guilt, and hope is especially sharp in “holding back a hillside” and in her insistence on preserving the screw. The narrator’s motives—listening, translating, preserving stories—are consistent and drive her choices under pressure. The only minor shortfall is that her own buried pain around losing smell is more implied than actively tested in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—to transform scars into stories and prove themself in this ritual—is clear, embodied, and consistently drives micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict between fear/hesitation and trust/surrender shows up concretely in the trembling hand, the frost choking the lines, and the decision to reach back to childish superstitions. The final reframing of scars as “shorelines” that teach “the shape of the sea” feels earned by what we’ve seen, not imposed. Elder Nam is spare but effective as a relational crucible, exerting pressure through standards and quiet mercy rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s guilt, professional cynicism, and real longing to repair harm are woven into nearly every beat, and Mara’s mix of wariness and care gives the relationship credible friction. The specific detail of “a scar my stories gave her, a map I hate to read on her wrist” makes the harm concrete and personal. The apology and promise to change the column feel earned by prior revelation rather than declared for effect. A hair more dramatized internal push-pull at the exact moment of the ritual would push this closer to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s role and motivation as “end of history witness” are clear and consistent, and the inward shift from scolding to listening is credibly seeded in the dictionary/illusion etymology. Interiority is distinctive (“wanderingly exact”) but highly cerebral; we rarely feel embodied fear, doubt, or resistance, so the emotional cost of the shift stays muted. Micro-choices—the decision to stop counting, to offer attention “like a bowl,” to place the book on the dais—track well with the arc. However, contradictory impulses under pressure (urge to judge vs. urge to unify) are more stated than dramatized in live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and character-particular; we feel a competent, anxious craftsman whose mind works in images of edges, knives, and flow. Motivation—both professional (fix the drift) and existential (understand what clocks measure)—is clear and consistent. The change at the end (accepting “razor edges” and “sharpen patience”) feels earned, though the internal conflict remains mostly contemplative rather than sharply self-opposed. A slightly stronger sense of real cost (beyond unease) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is specific and embodied—the laser button, breathing the “electrical dark,” the history of gripping vs loosening create a credible internal conflict between control and permeability. Motivation and change are well earned: their shift from “keep us whole” via hard boundaries to tuning gradients with open palms is organic. The relationship with Ren deepens under pressure and functions as a crucible, particularly in the moment when Ren looks to them to read Mira’s act as misalignment rather than crime. The only limitation is that Ren and Mira’s own flaws and contradictions remain somewhat underdeveloped compared to the narrator’s.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and specific—the blend of probabilistic thinking, filial worry, and inherited gambler-logic feels lived-in, with contradictions activated on the page (her “method” in the stacks vs. her pragmatic caretaking at the ward). Micro-choices (following the scrawls, pocketing the lantern and map, invoking the carrot code, pressing him to eat) are all clearly motivated by this mix. The father-daughter dynamic is textured, with status tilts and mutual stubbornness revealed through small negotiations about luck and food. The final poise—accepting that what she wants is “to widen perspectives responsibly enough to hold him”—reads earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The operator’s interiority is specific and grounded in vocation, with lovely details like “callers cannot meet silence without mistaking it for judgment” revealing character. Her motivation—to “teach endings how to begin”—is consistent and borne out through concrete micro-choices (who she connects, when she recedes). Internal contradiction (her own loss vs. chosen estrangement) is present but more implied than dramatized in-scene, which slightly softens impact. Still, the endurance/renunciation at the end (staying in the tunnel, polishing the disc, keeping distance) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archivist’s motivation—reknitting the covenant while living with unresolved loss—is specific, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro-choices (waiting for the “only correct hour,” deciding she can only write the ache, not the woman, back into the roll). Her inner conflict between duty and grief runs throughout without tidy resolution and culminates in an earned endurance at the end. Kellen is lightly but cleanly drawn, applying gentle pressure through questions and ritual partnership. The only small limitation is that her flaws (attachment, possible rigidity) are hinted more than sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation and contradictions are sharply etched: she’s both elusive and deeply attentive, seeking “the cure for loneliness” while refusing to name it. Her choices—trading logistics for stories, inventing the rock’s rumor, then stepping back from the center—are consistent and revealing. Emotional interiority is mostly inferred through image rather than direct thought, but it remains specific (e.g., “felt seen only by their needs, which was close enough to love”). The endurance at the end—remaining the unseen facilitator rather than claiming overt belonging—reads as an earned, costly stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mapmaker’s motivation—to find the stillpoint so he can survive and navigate overwhelming emotion—is clear, consistent, and paid off in the ending. His sensory methods and history (“after a winter when words would not hold him”) give him specificity beyond archetype. However, his internal conflict remains relatively smooth and contemplative; contradictory impulses (“you left” / “you returned”) surface but never quite force a fraught, on-page dilemma. The final change—carrying the stillness as a tool to guide others—is credible and earned, but not sharply costed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives (responsibility, exhaustion, “to thresh meaning from experience”) are specific and consistently drive choices, especially the refusal to brute-force the array a second time in favor of a “smaller kindness.” Internal conflict between godlike power and modest repair is well dramatized rather than declared. The relationship with Mara is sketched efficiently but distinctively, with her gift of the pen and later comms call reframing earlier beats. The final endurance—accepting an uncorrected but differently held past—feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to disrupt the regatta as an act of mercy for the forgotten—is clear, specific, and consistently embodied in micro-choices (recruiting workers, chalking the pier, using the camera as “baton”). The advisor is distinct, with her quiet charisma and signing shaping tactics rather than being a mere trope. Emotional texture is richly embodied in gesture and sensory detail (tingling fingers, “names that fell like rain”), not just labels. Internal conflict is relatively muted, skewing more toward quiet conviction than contradiction, but the final endurance—accepting absence as a form of presence—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (rescuing Mira/promise vs. guilt over the arson) is clear, specific, and governs every major choice, culminating in the choice to reopen a space for vulnerable memory instead of burning again. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“Patterns whisper; smoke graphs its own arguments”), with the flaw of listening to flames rather than worshiping them landing as both trait and moral axis. The relationship with Mira, though largely off-stage, feels lived-in and charged by status and trust, especially in “Because you do not worship flames; you listen to what they try to say.” If anything, Mira’s on-page emotional complexity is compressed by length; she functions more as visionary and judge than fully conflicted person in the final vault scene.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (risking herself to reach Jonah) is clear, specific, and consistently drives choices from signing the forms to consenting to deeper coherence. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“air… petals that shivered like thoughts,” “auroral sorrow”) and the quietly rebellious streak plays against fear in a credible way. The relationship with Jonah feels textured despite his physical absence, especially through the drumming habit she “borrows” and amplifies. A touch more on-the-page contradiction or momentary hesitation at the peak might deepen the internal conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator is sharply etched: competent, idiosyncratic, with a tactile relationship to metal and sound and a specific inherited worldview (“taught me to listen to iron”). Motivation (prove whispers > shouts, help the courier) is clear and drives all tactics. Internal contradiction is muted—the piece could use a touch more visible fear, doubt, or selfish impulse under pressure—but the quiet endurance at the end reads as earned stasis. Otero and the courier function cleanly as pressures rather than full characters, which fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guardian’s motivation (the vow, teaching darkness, keeping the city listening) is clear and consistently expressed through choices like refusing to speak even under pressure. Interiority is vivid and particular, filtered through ritual and image rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is underplayed—the potential tension between his vow and the urgency of saving the boy’s brother stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a live, painful conflict. The boys register more as presences and catalysts than fully pressured individuals, which keeps the relational crucible comparatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator is sharply etched: patient, attentive, ethically cautious, and their shift from “not a marcher or a mayor” to orchestrating a town-wide action feels earned. Motivation (protecting the library/grotto and the kids’ quieter selves) is clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is present but mostly implied—duty vs reluctance to coerce—rather than dramatized in a live dilemma. The kids and adults are sketched as a chorus more than individuated characters, which slightly limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is sharply etched: a hyper-competent, over-listening dock worker whose arc from solitary laborer to communal guide feels earned. Motivation (“to find freedom in embracing one's true nature”) is dramatized through specific choices—taking the skiff, planting the scrimshaw, returning to teach surrender. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“argue with the sea the way you scold a beloved child”) rather than generic. The only minor limit is that contradictory impulses under peak pressure are more implied than overtly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The performer is richly drawn through actions and objects rather than direct exposition: his past as a joy-instructor, his current tending of an “emotional void,” the whittled birds, and jars of salt all reveal a coherent, morally ambiguous psyche. His contradictory impulses—complicity vs. sheltering, performance vs. refusal to smile—are present in scene, especially with the inspector. The final endurance choice (teaching “no more forgetting”) feels earned by prior beats. I could use one or two sharper moments of embodied, in-the-body emotion under pressure to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cloud-shadow poet is rendered with a clear, specific sensibility—patient, aesthetically driven, nonviolent—and his actions consistently reflect that ethos, especially in how he paraphrases the ban into invitation. His interiority is implied more through image and method than direct thought, which mostly works but slightly flattens the sense of live internal contradiction under pressure. The custodians function credibly as a responsive chorus, though they remain archetypal rather than individuated. The final choice to act as translator of boundaries feels earned, but its emotional cost is more conceptual than personally fraught on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ilias’s motivation—to find beauty in imperfection—is clear and consistently drives his choices, especially his insistence on working with the failed phoenix and the child’s cracked prism. Emotional texture is mostly conveyed through action and image rather than direct interiority but still feels specific (his restraint around compliments, his reliance on value over color). Mara and the apprentice register as distinct presences through their plant-language dynamic, though their internal conflicts are only lightly sketched. The change by the end is a credible endurance: Ilias keeps “painting the brave cracks,” foreclosing the path of simple repair in favor of a costlier attentiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bell ringer’s worldview and temperament are specific and consistent, and her choices (inviting the child to ring, pushing back gently on the director) flow naturally from that characterization. Motivation—using sound to rebuild connection post-outage—is clear and threaded throughout. Internal contradiction is more muted than it could be; she rarely feels truly torn or at risk, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. Still, she reads as an individual rather than a type, and the final stance feels earned by what has come before.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation—transmuting grief into tending—is clear, specific, and acted on through concrete choices (designing the lockets, orchestrating the ritual, deciding to keep the observatory open). Interiority is richly embodied and idiosyncratic (“a lung paused at the top of breath,” “grammar of lungs after loss”), with a credible blend of despair and fragile purpose. The relationship with the dead wife, mediated through the stencil, adds a second emotional axis that sharpens the narrator’s conflict between unmaking their craft and repurposing it. The final stance—choosing ongoing, costly tending over withdrawal—feels earned and not tidy, with grief clearly persisting.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motive—“steadily curious,” drawn by inherited mystery—is clear and carries through the mapping work, and the cartomancer’s grounded, methodical counterpoint gives their dynamic specificity. Emotional states are mostly embodied through action and image (tape clicking, stepping from pin to pin) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than it might be for this tier; the narrator moves fairly smoothly from confusion to participation without a strongly dramatized moment of hesitation or cost. Still, the final willingness to lend “your feet” and breath to the lattice reads as an earned, character-based shift.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motives (escape from “sanctioned stories,” hunger for forbidden knowledge) are clear, specific, and drive every choice, especially the decision to release the cages. Interiority is rich and idiosyncratic, with genuine contradiction between hoarding knowledge and serving the collective. The final “betrayal” of her teachers feels earned and costs her a self-image, not just comfort. The only minor limit is that we get her in one highly elevated register, so some human roughness or pettiness under stress is hinted at but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dusk noticer’s vocation, habits, and contradictions (regret versus guardianship, endurance versus tenderness) are specific and consistently dramatized through micro-choices—engaging the shadow, choosing patience, offering to “catalog its ache.” The relationship with the shadow functions as a crucible without dialogue, with status shifting from wary observer to midwife of identity. Emotional states are embodied in concrete rituals (handling bowls, the stone, the reels) rather than label-speak. The final stance—binding the shadow to kindness while holding luminous regret—feels earned by the prior pattern of attention with a clear, quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interior conflict is rich and specific—the narrator’s braided anger and compassion (“people do not molt out of fear cleanly”) feels earned, and her final conditional offer to Karim has clear emotional cost. Her micro-choices (keeping one vial, how she frames the sanctuary as repair not hideout) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values under pressure. Karim, though mostly filtered through her, has a credible arc from con-man to someone risking humiliation by full confession. The only minor limitation is that we glimpse less of his lived contradiction in the present scene than of hers, keeping this just shy of fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—seeking “closure” by opening wounds to read scars—is specific, embodied, and drives every choice, from undergoing the procedure to cutting the elm. The internal conflict between the urge to know and the wish to avoid cruelty is credible and resolved in a nuanced way at the end (“I will seek closure, but no longer by opening”). Emotional texture is conveyed through concrete sensations (sutures, pain, vertigo) rather than labels. The only minor limitation is that we glimpse little of the narrator’s life beyond this moment, so relational or social dimensions of the flaw remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s motivation is sharply defined (“I am here to find where unused love is stored”) and their choices—requesting the strip, performing the reading, deciding what to archive—are consistent and purposeful. The manager is lightly sketched but functions well as a worried foil whose tremor and questions keep pressure in the room. Internal contradiction is limited: the crystal gazer feels more like a composed specialist than someone under genuine emotional strain, so we don’t get much in-scene self-conflict. The closing stance—gentler archival care rather than exorcism—feels earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s drive to free trapped creativity is clear, consistent, and embodied in concrete micro-choices (stepping into the arch, unlocking fear stitch by stitch). Interiority is vivid and specific, with a believable sense of cost when “a thin line of cold remained inside me.” What’s missing at a top-tier level is sharper internal contradiction under pressure—she rarely doubts, hesitates, or reveals a value conflict that complicates her mission. The keeper relationship is lightly sketched and does not significantly pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guard’s motive—to “cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners” and seek “a handful of unspent futures”—is clear, consistent, and carried through his choices, especially in offering his sleep and accepting ongoing duty. His contradiction (yearning for tiny mercies, bound to vast, lonely responsibility) is strong but remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in more granular emotional beats. The dreamlessness and superposition traits are vivid but keep him slightly archetypal rather than fully individuated. The final endurance—remaining dreamless and bound to the clock—is an earned stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation (“To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind”) is clear and consistent, and their choices—practicing listening, engaging with the tower’s test, accepting the mirror’s revelation—track cleanly from that drive. The interiority is vivid and particular, if more conceptual than bodily, with only a light sense of contradictory impulses (craving structure vs surrendering to spirals). The final shift—recognizing the gear as a tooth from their own gate and “chew[ing]”—feels earned by prior images and actions. I’d push for slightly more embodied emotional texture to reach top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—finding “where unused courage waits”—is clear and plays through each micro-choice, especially the decision to kneel and let the dog set the pace. Interiority is embodied and specific (“breathe smaller so as not to scatter” pawprints) rather than abstract. The guides are sketched mainly through function and ritual, but their gentle firmness under pressure feels consistent and characterful. The final shift—from needing a leash to co-walking by choice—reads earned and carries a real emotional cost without tipping into tidy self-therapy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to interrogate the cost of safety after surviving violence—is clear and consistently pressures every micro-choice, from accepting the bellhop’s help to how she seats the bolt. Her internal conflict between craving quiet and refusing “unpardonable silence” is dramatized, not summarized, especially around the engine choice. Embodiment (“nerve regeneration that wrote lightning under my skin”) grounds the abstract stakes in the body. The bellhop reads as a specific individual—duty-bound, quietly rebellious—despite never speaking, which sharpens the relationship dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lys’s motive and methods are sharply etched—“sunder a sentence so precisely it bled accurate silence” captures her character more than any label. The gardener and pretender register quickly and distinctly through gestures and specific metaphors (linen smile, heirloom coat). Interiority is mostly implied via action and imagery rather than explicit thought, which keeps things coolly distant but still coherent. There’s little on-page contradiction or cost in Lys herself, so the emotional arc feels precise but somewhat untested.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to understand disappearing paths, both tidal and familial—is clear, specific, and consistently informs her choices. Interiority is textured and embodied (“silted shoes,” hearing her mother’s steps in her taps) without slipping into diagnostic language. Internal conflict between scientific observation and grief over eroding stories is present but remains relatively low-temperature, which slightly softens the perceived cost of her final stance. Jun and the mother function well as relational pressures, though their on-page presence is more catalytic than crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives—seeking meaning rather than spectacle, honoring the lull while still acting—are vivid and consistent, and every choice (opera glasses over telescope, gentle restart, asking for stories) aligns with those values. Interiority is specific and embodied (“letting my soles listen,” “awkwardly confident”) rather than abstract feeling labels. There is a clear internal tension between urgency and restraint that resolves into an earned stance at the end. The only limiter is that their flaws (naïveté, possible over-romanticizing) never truly backfire on the page, so cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized: she opposes “implanted destiny” as obedience masquerading as fate and makes micro-choices (following the script yet altering one sigil) that reveal a coherent value hierarchy. Her insurgent status, age, and plant-telepathy all meaningfully color how she acts and perceives, not just how she’s labeled. Internal conflict is present but relatively understated—she never seriously wavers from her stance, so the arc is more about method than self-doubt, which keeps this just shy of the very top band. The moral courage to alter the elders’ ritual in front of the council lands as an earned, character-particular transformation of tradition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Samira’s characterization is rich, specific, and embodied: the survivor history, the crumpled photo, and her somatic freezes all cohere into a credible psyche. Her motives (safety, truthful hope, honoring the dead) clearly drive concrete micro-choices like moving the benches, facing down the chair, and where she stores the photo. Internal conflict—between her flinch response and her chosen, regulated stance—is dramatized rather than explained. The final act of tucking the photograph under the basin reads as an earned, costly renunciation/reconfiguration rather than a tidy symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s inner life is specific and embodied—the “luminescent ache,” fear of light as “a knife of reflections,” and the cracked tarot box as chest mirror a coherent psychology. Her motivation (to redesign how she sees, not just what she paints) is clear and drives every choice, from climbing the lighthouse to descending into darkness and taking on the tedious untangling. Contradictory impulses—withdrawal vs. service, prophecy vs. “only weather”—are present and resolved into a costly new stance. The only minor limitation is that no external relationship on the page tests her changes under interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tracker’s motive—“to discover why time slows in crisis” rooted in the sister’s death—is clear, persistent, and governs every choice. Interiority is vivid and particular (“serene anger sits in my chest like a coiled current”), and the final endurance choice (bracing the beam without rewriting history) feels earned. The internal conflict between grief/anger and disciplined inquiry is present but could be fractionally sharper in the exact moment of stepping back into the death scene. Overall, the character reads specific, competent, and flawed without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s interior conflict between oath and desire to expose the truth is specific, textured, and carried through to the decisive act of sending the letter. Lines like “the courage and the doubt feeding one another like wolves that refuse to starve” embody simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene, not just in summary. Her choice to sign her name and accept potential punishment makes her bravery and fear feel earned rather than declared. The shadow’s presence gives a minimal but effective relational crucible that subtly tests her stance without undercutting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s pacifism, loyalty, and buried anger toward her father are all legible and in contradiction, and her key choices (dust line, sheathing the knife, refusing his mission) grow clearly out of those tensions. The father is sketched in economical, telling strokes—“smelling of turbine smoke and an unsettled map,” hovering at the knife—so his softening at the end feels earned. The relationship functions as the crucible: their status dynamic flips from his moral authority to hers as she teaches him to “breathe with the leaves.” If anything, her internal resistance to him could show one more moment of genuine temptation to revert to his way to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fisher’s motive (to retrieve the goddess’s echo for the child) is clear and consistent, and his methodical, calm temperament is well embodied in images like “as a stone teaching water to wait.” However, interior contradiction under pressure is only lightly implied rather than dramatized; he never truly seems in danger of yielding to the echo’s hooks. His competence at “voicing silence” borders on the frictionless, so his final success, while satisfying, feels somewhat assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator is sharply etched: an heir torn between legacy, truth, and institutional loyalty, with actions (challenging Kline, stopping the deletion, drafting the statement) clearly driven by that mix. Her interiority is precise and particular (“headline princess grown into a reluctant queen,” carrying the pen that “smells like inked thunder”). Contradictory pulls—duty to the observatory, fear of scandal, inherited perfectionism from her father—play simultaneously in scene and culminate in a costly, principled choice. Secondary characters (Kline, the technician) are sketched efficiently but still feel psychologically plausible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s guilt, vocation, and ruined gift intertwine into a sharply particular psyche, with concrete, idiosyncratic embodiments (“Guilt set like frost inside my chest, a chiming that never fades”). Their motivations are consistent and grow more pressured as they move from generalized atonement to naming the nephew directly. Internal conflict—need to hush guilt vs. self-punishing vigilance—plays under most beats and informs the final “Rest now, not goodbye, but hush.” The only ceiling is that contradictory impulses rarely collide in a single, fraught on-page hesitation; the choices feel assured rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is sharply etched—a whimsical, backward-listening chalk artist whose usefulness and unease are dramatized through specific actions (e.g., “Your memory wants a banister”). Internal conflict is subtler: they’re competent in holding others’ pain yet only obliquely register their own “lilac unease,” which softens the emotional cost of their role. Relationships with others are glimpsed in charged moments rather than developed arcs, but these glimpses are vivid and character-particular. The ending endurance—a changed relationship to noise/meaning—is earned and legible without feeling pat.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motivation as a “gentle radical” with “aberrant mercy” is vivid and consistent, and micro-choices (coming to the plaza, staying for the patrol, how they speak to the leader) clearly express a hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific and embodied through images like “arms of steel” and being “retrocognitively trapped.” The patrol leader, though briefly seen, feels dimensional—his “title-heavy” weariness and hunger are convincing. The internal conflict between being bound to the past and needing to act in the present could be shaded with slightly more friction under peak pressure, but feels real enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ghost’s motive—to win Rowan an “encore” of courage—is clear, particular, and consistently expressed through his tactics with the orchard. Rowan herself is sketched mostly through poetic externalization (cracked hands, talking to exit signs, abandoned blueprint), which is vivid but keeps her interior conflict a bit distant. The ghost’s synesthetic perceptions give him a distinctive inner life, but we rarely see him under true pressure or caught between contradictory impulses. The final stance change—Rowan recommitting to her nursery plan—is earned but emotionally a shade too tidy for top-tier character work.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the narrator’s blend of awe, ethical anxiety, and bodily attunement feels lived, and Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” role is consistent and active (“Consent, she said…”). Motivation is clear—learning to handle this leaking telepathy responsibly—and culminates in a credible renunciation (no more pill) plus a chosen alternative (craft and grounding). Internal conflict is quiet but present in the tension between appetite for listening and fear of intrusion. The main limitation is that their flaws and blind spots are only lightly stressed; the piece rarely forces them into truly ugly or risky choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s vocation, sensibility, and motivations are vivid and consistent, with concrete embodied responses (heat-mapped emotions, physical navigation of the cave) revealing character under conceptual pressure. Her drive “to become the voice of the unknown” is dramatized through choices like following the “lane of sorrow” and threading the chord into the sleepers’ dreams. Internal conflict is present but relatively subtle—there’s little felt push–pull between doubt and commitment, which keeps this from an even higher band. The endurance/resolution at the end (accepting partial truth and responsibility) is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive—to challenge and reweave the town’s prophecy—tracks cleanly through their methods (cataloging buttons, opening the echo, ringing the bell). Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (“stories tucked in dust,” “tools that remember”), with consistent occupational detail. What’s missing at a highest-tier level is embodied ambivalence or felt cost; the town’s resistance and the narrator’s fear never really bite back. The final stance feels earned but a little too untroubled by doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s mix of guilt, competence, and tentative courage feels specific and lived-in, and her micro-choices (coming early, scraping the fourth line as apology, accepting the mission) align tightly with that psychology. The burn, Mina’s belief, and the idea of “unused courage” triangulate into a clear, compelling internal conflict. Contradictory impulses are present but could be dramatized more viscerally—she rarely feels on the verge of bolting or betraying herself in the moment. The contact is sketched effectively but remains more function than character.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich and specific: the narrator’s terror of erasing “beginnings” versus the desire for one clean line is dramatized rather than summarized, and the contradiction drives every micro-choice with the linen and needle. The coachman’s gentle, oblique pressure (“some crossings only begin once you accept the shape of waiting”) functions as a character crucible rather than a stock guide. The final renunciation of ornament — stitching “stay, and labor beside” — is fully earned by the prior palimpsest anxiety and carries a clear emotional cost. A minor limit is that the bride herself remains a bit abstract as a person, surfacing more as pressure than as a fully felt counterpart.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The potter’s inner life feels specific and embodied—“questions nested under my ribcage,” “slow enough to hear clay explaining itself”—and her drive to understand the oasis’ resistance to change motivates every action. Interiority and external choices align: she tests kindness, reads the land’s responses, and ultimately enacts a small ritual and leaves guidance for others. The change is conceptual and credible: she shifts from inquiry to a kind of custodial complicity with the place’s ethic. The only slight limitation is that contradiction or sharp internal conflict under pressure is muted; the arc is more serene discovery than fraught struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives are clear, specific, and embodied: she wants to bring light and gentling to a neglected stairwell while guarding her own hope. Her internal contradiction—“protected vulnerability,” hoping while “my hands keep moving”—is dramatized through micro-choices like waiting for the last petal and using scraps rather than grand gestures. Secondary characters (Theo, his mother, Mrs Gallo, Mr Alvarez) briefly but effectively reflect back facets of her desire and fear. The final endurance—accepting that the rosebush is “not done speaking” and letting the hush become a harbor—feels earned and carries quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to translate isolation into independence”) is clear, consistent, and drives each choice, especially seeking the Librarian and vowing a new stance. Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic, filtered through images of tides, stone circles, and catalog markings rather than generic emotion labels. Internal conflict—shame vs. “Tone: None,” desire for connection vs. refusal to “invent new ghosts”—is present and credibly resolved into an Earned Stasis. The only slight limit is that emotion remains largely conceptual and metaphorized, with minimal visceral embodiment under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, longing, and self-contradiction (writing others’ love while failing her own) are sharply drawn and govern every choice, especially the decision to make a public installation instead of a private plea. Embodied perception—ink-stained fingers, damp letters, the ribbon at her wrist—keeps emotion grounded. The reunion is quiet but earned by prior traits: reticence, reverence for other people’s words, and the need to act through art rather than direct speech. A slight limitation is that the lost lover’s individuality remains somewhat abstract beyond “dust in her hair.”

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to protect the station and community by outwitting the tricksters—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete technical choices rather than abstraction. Interiority is vivid and specific (“tricksters wearing vacuum for boots,” “I am cautiously hopeful because I remember something old tech people forget”), giving a strong sense of mind and ethic. Internal contradiction (fear vs. “cautiously hopeful” stance, desire to disrupt vs. commitment to bridges) is present but could be dramatized more sharply under peak pressure. The relationship with the provost is an effective late crucible, though the provost’s shift feels a touch easy, blunting visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s mix of claustrophobia, “prudently adventurous” temperament, and ethical hesitation about binding the city creates a textured, specific interiority. Her careful tactics (choosing the fallow period, counting rungs, measuring breaths) feel fully motivated by these traits. The final promise to “keep the air generous” reads as an earned stance rather than a tidy revelation. The only limit is that no secondary on-page character presses directly against her flaws in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s characterization is specific and embodied—his face blindness, reliance on rhythm and texture, and belief in portraits as “sirens of ache” all shape his tactics and worldview under pressure. The captain’s careful, rehearsed public persona fraying into halting confession is credible and well-seeded. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (Lio as “hired for portraits, never for justice, yet the two had begun to blend”), and could be sharpened slightly with one more moment of real ambivalence. Overall, the final stance—refusing to forgive or condemn—feels earned and morally costly without being tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives (reversible exile, duty to the drowned, vindicating Seraphine) are specific and consistently dramatized, and her micro-choices—petitioning too hard, taking the nail to the cliff, choosing to stay—arise cleanly from them. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“paper keeps my pulse honest,” rubbing the nail) rather than labeled. The internal conflict about leaving vs. staying is present but could tighten earlier so the final choice feels slightly more actively tortured on the page. Mirek is sketched efficiently as a secondary pressure, though the relationship dynamic could carry one more explicit moment of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Characters feel particular and emotionally credible—the bridge-song fiddler is especially vivid, and the hitchhiker’s sideways step fits the world’s logic. The narrator’s inner shift from fear to “pixelated amnesty” is legible and earned, though their internal conflict could be sharpened further under peak pressure. Relationships do apply pressure (the narrator’s relief and trust, the fiddler as guide, the hitchhiker as enigma), but status dynamics stay gentle rather than crucible-hot. The final assent to leave the flake behind is a believable, motivated choice that forecloses a more fearful stance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s layered identity—robber’s son, contrite founder, present-day caretaker—is sharply etched and internally consistent, with the father’s motel-loop wisdom credibly haunting his startup ethics. Motivation is clear (reckoning with inherited circularity), and his final choice to “walk through the markers” feels earned by what we’ve seen. Emotions are mostly embodied via objects and setting (tin, bills, rails) rather than direct labels, which suits the mode. A hairline limit is that his internal conflict, while rich, rarely degrades his composure on the page, so we don’t fully see contradictory impulses peaking in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivations and emotional throughlines are clear and specific: the narrator’s drive to decode the inscriptions is braided credibly with their need to help Mara and process Orla’s absence, and Mara’s guarded grief loosens in legible stages (“as if untied”). The “heals with words” trait is dramatized through micro-choices—asking about the sound of the collapse, reading the lines aloud to the desert team—rather than just asserted. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: the narrator’s anxiety and tenderness coexist, though the piece could push harder on moments where their need to witness clashes with Mara’s initial silence. The final renunciation—“I finally let go”—feels earned by prior beats and comes with a visible cost in shared vulnerability rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Issa’s characterization is vivid and specific—“guarded,” “of the Returning,” with an “old warlike serenity”—and her motives (to confront the truth she helped bury) are coherent and consistent. Her internal conflict between loyalty/guilt to Master Ren and commitment to truth is dramatized rather than stated, especially in the bile/iron moment before she steadies “as if setting spear to shield.” The closing shift—seeing “the room inside her armor” as not empty but ready—feels earned by prior beats. A slightly sharper sense of what concrete risk she faces in defying Ren’s magic (beyond moral cost) would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s mix of obligation, curiosity, and “anxious elation” produces a credible, specific interiority, and the final state—“still bound, but not stuck”—feels like an earned reconfiguration of that bind. The girl’s fear-shot courage is sketched efficiently through action (offering her scars, running ahead of clocks) rather than label. Internal contradiction (hound and rabbit of revelation; wanting the hour that “should never come” yet dreading it) is vivid without over-explaining. The only limiter is that we never see a serious temptation to refuse the covenant, so the final acceptance, while resonant, carries modest on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s characterization as a “reckless idealist” who learns that “courage without a craft is only noise” gives the arc credible tension and evolution, especially in light of the brother’s sacrifice. Interiority is specific, embodied through actions like soothing the roots with a family lullaby and offering herself to be read by the orchard. The relationship with the brother, though mostly mediated through the card, still feels particular and ethically charged. A slight limitation is that her flaws are named very explicitly rather than always dramatized, which dulls some ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s mix of stubborn practicality and tenderness around sound feels sharply particular, and his shame over the televised mistake grounds his choices. Interiority is embodied and specific—e.g., facts as a “railing across an inner ravine”—showing genuine contradiction between numbing himself and allowing the ache in. His relationship with Lark is sketched efficiently through status and need (she needs proof, he needs work-shaped silence), with subtle power-sharing by the end. The final decision to pursue Echo Bench for purpose rather than reputation is well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s mix of “haunted ambitions” and “kindly methodical” restraint is sharply drawn, and every action at the arbor arises from that tension. Her arc—from wanting mastery/rescue (“the rescue of a person from that slope”) to accepting a humbler, custodial role—feels fully motivated by what happens on the page. Emotional life is conveyed through concrete attention to tools and environment, not labels. The only slight limit is that we never see her pushed into truly desperate contradiction; the struggle stays contemplative rather than jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s interiority and vocation are specific and coherent—“built to file, but I learned to listen” is a sharply characterizing line. Motivation (preserving wonder, shepherding shifting identities) is clear and drives their choices with the baker and the boy. Internal contradiction exists (machine made for order choosing to honor flux) but remains more conceptual than emotionally pressured. The change at the end feels like a deepened recommitment rather than a costly shift, which slightly limits the arc’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, especially in the tension between her official role and her secret work with “abandoned hopes.” Her final choice to crown the stalagmite and alter the inspection record feels earned by that established contradiction and carries credible cost (risking doctrine, job, and identity). Embodied emotion is mostly filtered through perception of environment, but it remains concrete rather than abstract. The only small limit is that her personal backstory and blind spots are gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—truth-telling as a route to self-forgiveness without self-exoneration—is specific, credible, and drives every choice, from returning to the station to clearing the culvert by hand. Interiority is richly embodied (“mud under my thumbnails,” “my hands remembered the boy's shoulders”) and full of believable contradiction: she both seeks solace and refuses absolution. Her final stance—doing “unglamorous maintenance” and writing “as blunt as river stones”—is fully earned by prior self-deception and guilt. The busker functions as a quiet relational crucible, offering presence and judgment without easy comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The veiled dreamer’s motivation and internal contradictions are clear and coherent throughout—“cautious exuberance” vs. restraint is dramatized in choices like not tearing the sewn books. However, the character remains largely archetypal and abstract; we get rich mindset but almost no individuating life particulars or sharply rendered flaws. The final learning (“to speak by waiting, and to write by listening”) feels earned but relatively low-cost, with little sense of what is being risked or left behind. Strong interiority, but not yet at the depth or specificity expected for top-tier literary character work.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s internal conflict between professional complicity and ancestral promise is vivid, specific, and sustained from first line to last. Micro-choices (consulting plants, pouring coffee, choosing to play) all feel like pressured steps along that fault line. The final renunciation of the museum role in favor of keeping the mountain people’s promise is fully earned and carries visible cost. Emotions are embodied in idiosyncratic images rather than labels, avoiding safety-hedging around her complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation, competence, and relationship to her mother are sharply etched, and her grief is rendered through specific ritual acts rather than labels. Motivation is clear and consistent, especially around honoring her mother’s last request. Internal contradiction (professional detachment vs personal loss) is present but underplayed; the ritual proceeds almost too smoothly, with little visible risk of failure or emotional destabilization in the peak beat. The closing recommitment to duty feels earned but could carry more on-page struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The caretaker’s interiority is specific and textured: using the hairpin that represents maternal harm as a tool to heal and tend the vines is a strong, character-particular contradiction. Motivation (seeking contentment after “forgiving the unforgivable”) is coherent and inflects every micro-choice, from pruning to sparing canes. Embodied emotion is mostly carried through action and perception rather than labels. The main limitation is that conflict is largely reflective, so we rarely see her impulses clash in a live, pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s role as “conscience for hire” and Mara’s ethical bind are vivid and particular, with the cloak, shard, and chimes all revealing their inner states under pressure. Contradictory impulses (Mara’s duty vs. doubt; the narrator’s need to guide vs. refusal to absolve) are dramatized rather than summarized. The main softness is that Mara’s interiority leans more on metaphor than on a few concrete, embodied details that would individuate her further beyond archetypal “worried technocrat.” Still, the final stance—conditions instead of clean certainty—feels well earned by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s desire (to understand the researcher and his backward aging) is clear and consistent, and the tension between wanting answers now and submitting to the lesson is well-drawn. The researcher’s reserve, his “weaves truth carefully” quality, is dramatized through repeated withholding rather than simple label. Emotional experience is mostly embodied through setting-inflected perception (bones humming, stars in ribs) rather than generic labels. The final shift—accepting the lesson about vanishing and reading the iron-sand message—feels earned, though the personal cost to the narrator remains more conceptual than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motive—to learn to navigate without moving—is clear, coherent with her vocation, and governs her restraint when the pulse tugs north. Interiority is specific and embodied through ritual actions (silence, tapping, humming) rather than abstract labels. The internal conflict between the urge to chase and the discipline of stillness is dramatized (“I do not chase it… I want the world to do the walking around my stillness”). The final endurance—continuing to appraise until night, training the pulse to return—reads as an earned stasis with conceptual cost in patience and time.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motive (escaping automated cleverness to seek “the sacred in the simple”) is clear, embodied, and tested through specific micro-choices like unstrapping the assistive charms. Internal conflict between shame, dependency on tools, and longing for authenticity is present without being over-articulated. The final stance—keeping the pack but slack-strapped, writing “with absence beside me”—feels earned and forecloses a path of rented cleverness with a real cost. A slight neatness in the final emotional configuration is the only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lamplighter’s interiority is vivid and particular, with a clear flaw (“hides behind truth”) and a concrete, idiosyncratic desire (to discover the color of sound). His micro-choices—sneaking the skiff, diving alone, offering “a new truth as path”—track coherently with those traits. The final shift from hiding to listening is earned and legible as a before/after change. The only limit is that his contradictory impulses under pressure (fear vs compulsion) remain more implied than dramatized in embodied hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, worldview, and conflict between “keeping the scatter honest” and wanting to seed specific promises are sharply defined and consistently dramatized. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“chance outlives courage,” “faith…tastes like waiting with tools”), with embodied doubt and quiet enthusiasm coexisting in scene. Her final stance—choosing to maintain democratic randomness while still steering a “patient hello”—feels like an earned endurance with cost rather than a neat epiphany. The only limitation is that no other on-page character presses her, so relational crucible is absent by design.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reaper’s motivation—to name fears and mend the “distance” broken in the snowfield scene—is clear, specific, and carries through to the final act of naming their own fear Enough. Interiority is richly embodied in images (“ribs vibrate when grief leans in to listen”) rather than labels, and the contradiction between duty and heartbreak is present throughout. The closing renunciation/acceptance (claiming Enough) feels earned by prior beats of naming others’ monsters. This is a deeply realized interior arc with only the mildest risk of abstraction in places.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nera is vividly particular—“lukewarm mage,” “tepid kettle,” with mild, stubborn patience that tracks cleanly into her choices—and Aro’s regret and complicity are sharply sketched in a few lines. Motivation is coherent and specific: she believes the bell and dripping rates can mend the sea’s memory, he wants atonement for the last fish. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (her earnest naivete versus past guild scorn), more implied than actively dramatized in moment-to-moment conflict. The final renunciations (her acceptance of lukewarm power; his vow not to cast) feel earned, though not put under extreme emotional duress.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The warden’s internal conflict between enforcing the county’s erasure order and honoring communal memory is clear and consistently dramatized, especially when she radios for a pause in enforcement. Her emotional life is embodied through specific perceptions (the label “rippling something in my chest,” the bell’s “tinny laughter”) rather than abstract labels. The white-haired woman provides a subtle relational crucible that forces the narrator to acknowledge her link to Ruth and the town. The final oath reads earned, not declarative, because her earlier micro-choices—following the photos, convening the gathering—have already reoriented her role.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Her characterization is rich and specific: a disciplined, rational alchemist who is secretly sentimental, with concrete quirks like collecting petals and memories of her mother in the same orchard. The internal conflict between logic and tenderness is dramatized through micro-choices (how she adjusts the flame, whether to proceed with the final transformation). The final decision to delay the last firing feels earned by her prior worry about whether the “new self” can remain tender. Stakes remain a bit abstract and gentle rather than sharply fraught, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s mix of competence, humility, and suppressed pride is sharply drawn, and their “watcher” identity consistently drives micro-choices, especially in how they coach Lio through the buckle failure. The relationship with Lio carries history and asymmetrical power that modulates under pressure (his initial refusal vs. later trust), giving the dynamic texture. Internal conflict—between pride and self-erasure, care and command—remains live through the climax and informs the ending stance. The only thing keeping this short of the very top band is that the cost of this self-effacement, while present, could be shaded with one more concrete moment of personal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kana’s interiority is specific and textured—“ego death survivor,” “my balance finally stopped arguing,” and the fear of “snowblind calm” make her feel particular rather than generic. The central choice to vivify the brain and risk the return of feeling is well motivated by her vow to defeat numbness and the social pressure of the clones watching. Contradictory impulses (terror of blankness vs. responsibility to decide) coexist in the key moment at the jar. Secondary characters are sketched but functionally sharp, especially Ori as a moral/temperamental foil, though they don’t deepen much beyond their functions.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethos, and relationship to Mae are sharply etched and consistent, and their choices (planting the seed, designing “Seed,” resisting developers) read as motivated extensions of that core. However, interior conflict is muted; they rarely hesitate or reveal contradictory impulses, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow. The piece leans toward an idealized guardian-figure rather than a fully flawed human under strain. The final stance feels earned but relatively low-cost psychologically, limiting depth at this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conductor’s vocation, ethos, and limits (“I have learned never to keep more than necessary, and never to return it all…”) feel richly particular and motivate every choice. However, interior conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses on the page; we rarely see him waver or misstep under pressure. The “mournfully eager” paradox is strong but could be more enactment than label. Still, his micro-choices around how much laughter to restore and how to treat the machines reveal a coherent, singular character.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Both narrator and guardian have clear, specific motives—befriending uncertainty and dimensional homesickness—that reliably drive their choices, especially the joint refusal to step through the recovered window. The guardian’s role as “half cat and half catalog” and his distrust of certainty feel psychologically particular rather than archetypal. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized in scene, which slightly softens the emotional impact of the final renunciation. A touch more explicit friction in the narrator over whether to cross would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to interrupt the mills’ conscription of children—grounds every choice, and his blend of patience, severity, and tenderness feels specific rather than archetypal. “Stoically sensitive” is not just a label; it shows in how he logs failure “with a tenderness that kept shame from growing mold” and in his refusal to smile at the end. His decision to vivify absence instead of restoring the crozier is a credible, costly renunciation of conventional power. The only minor limit is that his inner contradictions are gestured to more than they are fully dramatized in direct internal conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “find the beginning in every ending”—is clear, persistent, and enacted via concrete choices (building the coupling, how and where to aim it, tasting the water). Interiority feels specific and idiosyncratic rather than generic, with the mentor and Sela grounding emotional stakes. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively soft; the narrator moves toward the experiment with little visible doubt or competing impulse. The relationship with Sela adds texture but doesn’t quite become a crucible that forces a costly relational choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s ardent attachment to liminality and service is vivid and particular (“trained by tides and ticket stubs to love the in between”), and his final renunciation feels emotionally earned. His motive—to fix the scattered timelines for his commuters and himself—remains consistent and grows into a credible self-sacrifice. Internal contradiction (wanting a destination yet choosing to be the hinge) is present, though it could be sharpened with one or two more moments of hesitation or selfish impulse. The relationship with the other self is strong but slightly under-pressured; there’s little real argument before they agree on who pays the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motives are specific and consistent—returning not for applause but to test connection in a space once built to house loneliness—and her contradiction (“math was kinder than people” vs. her elaborate architecture of intimacy) is well dramatized. Her interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (fog that “makes your footfalls consider their own echo,” the lover’s silence “like a chair”). The final shift—admitting geometry never protected her and choosing to step into the arena with the stranger—reads as an earned, costly reorientation rather than a tidy epiphany. Secondary figures stay textural rather than pressuring her directly, but that fits the design and doesn’t undercut the central arc.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to learn to navigate by starlight”) is clear, consistent, and drives concrete choices: using the chain link in class, petitioning the council, drafting the route, and ultimately leading the ascent. Interiority is specific and grounded in professional attention rather than generic feeling, and the legacy of the father’s trawler gives her a particular emotional texture. Internal tension—duty to the city’s survival vs. longing to look outward—is present but could surface in more embodied contradiction at the peak beats. Inea functions effectively as a foil, though the relationship pressure is more implied than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (“to protect vulnerable voices”) is vivid and consistent, and her choices—from following the old thread to orchestrating the small crowd at the end—align cleanly with that drive. Eli’s suicidal ambivalence is sketched efficiently through concrete details (the soaked shoes, bag of pills, the “debt he cannot pay”) and his donor-heart rain motif. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she’s both city-functionary and deeply personal mourner, following rules and dead-calls while bending them for one boy. The only thing holding this just below the very top tier is that her own vulnerability and potential failure-costs are more implied than directly dramatized in her body and thought under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ivo’s contradictions—claustrophobic yet a spelunker, terrified yet dutiful—are vividly rendered and drive his choices, especially the decision to endure the caves as an act of witness. Motivation (to stand by the unremembered) is clear and consistent, and embodied through small ritualistic actions like setting mugs and speaking names. Internal conflict is present but could be sharpened slightly under peak pressure; his fear never quite destabilizes his competence. The final shift—fear “lined itself up behind duty”—feels earned and carries a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to reclaim their miswritten life and extract “wisdom from failure”—is specific, felt, and consistently drives choices from climbing back up the mountain to accepting the ghost’s request. Interiority is rich and embodied (“I count my heartbeats constantly so the fear has numbers, not teeth”) with a clear contradiction between terror and a stubborn, almost reverent persistence. The relationship with the digital ghost has nuance (it both haunts and helps, wants to be remembered as more than interference) and shapes the final plan. The only minor limit is that their flaw set (beyond trauma and fear) isn’t tested against any truly opposing desire on the page, keeping the arc just shy of fully knotted complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s drive—to carry a dead language across its death at personal cost—is clear, specific, and remains coherent throughout. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“cracks are libraries,” “the promise had settled in me like a quiet bruise”), and their choices under pressure (feeding the diamond their own names) feel both inevitable and painful. Internal conflict between self-preservation and duty is implied more than dramatized, but the trade-off is still legible. The final endurance—accepting becoming an instrument—reads as earned stasis rather than tidy transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s grief, scientific rigor, and defensive humor are specific and consistent, and Marko’s “broken radio” return sharply motivates the quest. Interiority is vivid (“to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke”) and embodied in concrete rituals with the arrowhead. The final renunciation—letting the “stupidest pun” loose and accepting the vow—feels earned by prior contradictions between research-cover and aching loyalty. I’d only want a slightly sharper in-the-moment tug-of-war (fear vs. surrender) at the precise instant she chooses to make herself ridiculous.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—the desire “to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world” runs cleanly from the opening through the decision to descend and play. Interiority is embodied through sensory memory (hail on tin roofs, citrus, lanterns) and the locust shell, not label-speak. The main limitation is that internal conflict (fear of punishment, attachment to the “respectable tremor”) remains more implied than dramatized in the moment of risk. A slightly sharper on-page sense of danger or hesitation at the key choice would make the change feel even costlier.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courier’s interiority is specific and consistent—his “respectfully rebellious” stance, caution with the storm bottle, and method of “linking absences” all feel idiosyncratic and grounded. His choices (using the bottle, collaborating with the woman with the ledger, persisting with the vigil) are motivated by the need to heal broken promises and maintain fragile routes. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he honors rules while quietly undermining them, reveres his mother’s patience while engaging in risk. The evolution from solitary courier to co-architect of a new crossing reads as an earned, character-driven broadening rather than a sudden conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The carpenter’s motivation and temperament are vivid and consistent, especially his vow “not to hunt noise, but to interpret silence as possibility.” His persistence is dramatized through repeated dawn returns, delicate handling of objects, and the bucket-at-a-time plan, rather than just told. Internal contradiction is subtle but present—he resists spectacle even as he longs for motion and future children’s laughter. The arc is modest (endurance and commitment more than transformation) but credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The librarian’s desire “to find the place where stories live” is specific, consistent, and expressed through concrete micro-choices (learning hyperbolic geometry, using the atlas slot, shelving air). Interiority is deeply embodied in sensory and conceptual perception rather than named emotions, and the professional identity is vividly lived-in. Internal conflict is quiet but present—a tension between solitude and responsibility, ownership and service—culminating in the choice to return to the desk and “care for the geometers who do not yet know their shapes.” The only slight limiter is that contradictory impulses under peak pressure are more implied than dramatized in a sharp crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly particular—“keeper of tides, dust, and the catalog of things that want to return” immediately fuses role and psyche. Motivation (capture the dream vs honor Aria’s ethos of not trapping) is clear and comes under pressure at the lens when the dream “tests” the camera. Contradictory impulses—duty, loneliness, reverence for Aria—coexist rather than alternate, and the ending’s choice to catalog without caging reads as an Earned Stasis. The only limit at this length is that the internal conflict remains implicit rather than being stress-tested in a sharper, on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The locksmith and the scholar both feel particular and coherent, with motives rooted in fear vs. tenderness (“for every time they had folded a feeling into neatness”). Interiority is largely carried through image and action rather than explicit thought, which suits the mythic distance. The scholar’s internal contradiction—longing for release yet fearing articulation—is clear and pays off at the door, though we mostly get it in compressed, retrospective form. What keeps this just under the very top is that their micro-choices under pressure are more ritualized than conflicted, so cost is felt but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The folklorist’s motive—to reclaim stolen memories and repay old bargains—is clear, specific, and sustained, and her “hands-on” compulsion under water feels both professional and personal. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“trained in tidewriting and the empirics of rumor”), with a credible tension between caution and curiosity. Her final reconfiguration—recovering memory, standing “straighter in the water,” and bowing to the mushroom—reads as an earned shift in stance rather than a neat epiphany. The only thing holding this shy of the top band is that internal conflict never quite sharpens into a truly fraught either/or choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s interiority is vivid and particular, with a coherent mix of weariness, stubbornness, and principled gentleness (“I walk backwards when nervous…”; “I wanted to mentor resilience quietly, not heroics”). The girl is sharply etched through behavior and stance (“expression like flint and rain,” refusal to cry), and the brother’s brief emergence still feels human. Motivations are clear and aligned with choices, especially the archivist ceding credit to the girl. The main limitation is that internal contradiction under peak pressure is more implied than directly dramatized, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pruner’s motivation—to preserve wonder and tend both grief and Gray—is clear, consistent, and drives every choice, from crossing the root-bridge to offering succor instead of violence. Interiority is present through sensuous perception rather than explicit thought, which fits the mode. However, the character remains almost entirely serene and wise; we see little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle under pressure, which flattens potential complexity. The ending change reads more as fulfillment of their nature than as a costly evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s blend of craftswoman’s focus and quiet unease (“my secret is that I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones”) feels specific and grounded. Motivation is clear—this is their vocation, with hints of compulsion and inherited duty via the grandmother’s needle. The daughter is simpler but not flat; her fear and trembling participation at the last knot give her emotional contour. Change is subtle—more an earned endurance than a transformation—but the cost of holding this role is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator is sharply drawn—professionally precise, attentive to damage, motivated by “interpret[ing] silence with empathy.” Their choices (going to the chapel, refusing to wrench the handle, using patient research instead of force) all align with that core trait. Internal contradiction is present but relatively soft: curiosity versus respect never reaches a genuinely fraught impasse. The final stance—carrying the chapel’s lesson into their framing practice—feels earned, though the personal cost remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent—quietly analytic, saturated with grief, and shaped by a long intimacy with death. Micro-choices (choosing to untangle instead of cut, to document pulses, to take the globe, to write “WE HEARD YOU,” to release the globe) all align with that characterization. The internal conflict between wanting to remain analytic and being pulled into ritual and omen is credible and never over-explained. The only limiter is that the relationship with Malik remains thin as a crucible, keeping pressure mostly intrapsychic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to carry and translate “unspoken needs”—is specific, consistent, and rooted in a quiet, service-oriented temperament that feels particular rather than generic. Interiority is carried through how they perceive tools, clouds, and infrastructure rather than through abstract labels, which keeps emotion embodied in image. Internal conflict is relatively subtle (personal desire vs. collective needs; shyness vs. “bolder things”) but present and feeds into the final renunciation of purely personal asks. The endurance of their seldom-heard role, leaving the plate as a key for others, reads as an Earned Stasis with a credible, understated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interior life is richly particular: curiosity, duty, love, and restraint are all simultaneously active (“I loved her, I think, in the way a bell loves the wind that wakes it…”). The conflict between “warmly inquisitive” service and “affectionate detachment” is dramatized in the choice to read and then to obey the diary’s final instruction. Motivation stays clear and consistent—protecting Madam Vire, honoring her grief, and respecting boundaries—while still allowing a morally fraught trespass. The final endurance/renunciation in the forgetter room feels earned and carries a visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s grief-scientist persona is sharply drawn, with motivation (“prove that empty spaces remember”) consistently driving every action and metaphor. Contradictory impulses—rigorous method vs. irrational hope, proof vs. mourning—coexist in-scene, especially around tying the line “to the absence” while knowing “it is not rescue.” Emotional states are embodied through tools and procedures rather than stock feeling labels. The closing endurance (“Either way…we will have proved…”) reads as an earned, costly stance rather than a neat epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “mirror the sky inside walls” as compensation for face blindness and the loss of the father’s face—is vivid, particular, and drives every micro-choice. Interiority is rich and embodied in how they read rooms (“I never remember who has eyes like rain; I remember the way ceilings breathe”). Internal conflict is subtle but present: the tension between haste (demolition clock) and the need for extreme care in their craft. The quiet Earned Stasis at the end—choosing to give the building a face rather than try to save it—feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The apprentice’s curiosity, loneliness, and gentleness are rendered with specificity (talking to rivets, treating the light as a “guest”), and their motive is clean and consistent. Actions flow clearly from that disposition: reading the hopscotch, listening to the hum in the net, choosing to fold rather than “trap” the light. What’s missing at a top-tier level is real internal contradiction under pressure—there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost to their choices. The character endures rather than being deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The locksmith’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent—patient, listening, oriented toward gentle repair rather than conquest—and his choices (using the oil, telling the harbor story) align with that ethos. Interiority is embodied through tactile details (palms chafed, knot in his throat) rather than labels, and his professional identity feels specific rather than generic. The arc from seeking “the rhythm of repair” to carrying away “a listening” is thematically earned, though somewhat conceptual and serene, with limited felt internal contradiction or sharp cost. He remains a slightly mythic, emblematic figure rather than a fully individuated person with jagged flaws under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The collective “we” voice and the focused lens on Ana and Vine give real emotional specificity, especially in moments like Ana holding the bell “as if it were the wrist of a sick friend.” Motivations (save the orchards, trust Vine because of past rescue) are clean and consistent but lightly sketched rather than deeply conflicted. Internal contradiction is mostly implied—weariness vs. hope—rather than dramatized in on-page hesitation or dissent. The final exchange with Vine’s chalk carries cost and tenderness but still feels more thematic than rooted in a sharply individuated inner struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The adjuster’s core motive—mercy via “a slower fall, a hand beneath the chin of fate”—is specific, consistent, and governs every micro-choice in the ritual. His emotional life is embodied through tactile interaction with tools, sea, pane, and puppet rather than abstract labels. Internal conflict (duty and hope versus exhaustion and isolation) is present but remains understated, registering as a quiet ache more than a sharpened dilemma. The endurance at the end (“He has been my audience, then, for every rehearsal of the end”) feels like an Earned Stasis, though the cost could be made slightly sharper on the page to push into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s reluctance and sense of indebted duty are vivid and consistent, from “reluctant as a door” through to “giving directions empties me of myself.” Contradictory impulses—resenting being needed while still engineering the travelers’ salvation—operate simultaneously rather than in neat stages. Micro-choices (using the nut on the bird, then surrendering it to the youngest traveler) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The Earned Stasis at the end—remaining in the orchard, more emptied yet still choosing to guide—is fully motivated by what precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to atone and to translate separation into connection—is specific, consistent, and drives every concrete choice, from pocketing the chrysalis to building a responsive bridge and inviting her brother. Her flaw (treating people like controllable reactions) is dramatized, then directly confronted in the apology. The brother is sketched efficiently but feels real, with a credible mix of hurt, tentativeness, and willingness to meet her halfway. The final walk across the bridge, especially her catching his elbow and refusing to frame it as absolution, reads as an earned, costly shift rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s role as clean slate vendor with a private quest for “the place where stories begin” is specific and coherent, and the woman’s page-scar plus withheld name give her a sharply etched presence despite brief on-page time. Motivation tracks cleanly from professional function to personal risk when the narrator offers their own absence. Internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized—there’s little visible struggle before cutting into the father’s silence—so the final self-offering feels slightly too smooth for top-tier. Still, the emotional logic of both trades (her name, their father’s silence) reads earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chef’s interiority is rich and specific—his sensory experience of memories and grief reads as genuinely personal, not generic. Motivation is clear and consistent: he wants to ease the city’s pain without erasing it, and his restraint around touch shows a believable hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present but quiet (his desire to help versus the physical/emotional toll on his own body) and could be sharpened to heighten cost. Secondary characters (boy, castellan) are effectively sketched but function mostly as foils rather than full crucibles of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is vivid, idiosyncratic, and consistent—“her voice folded a room the way wheat bows to wind” shows how her sensibility drives action. Her motivation (rehabilitating a conversation / building a bridge) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: waking the choir, using the plumb line, confronting the councilman through ritual rather than argument. What’s missing at this echelon is real inner contradiction or cost; she rarely hesitates or missteps, so the arc feels more like steady unfolding than pressured change. The councilman’s brief turn provides some relational pressure but his interiority and the cost of his shift are only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motives (re-mapping grief, distinguishing self from Mira) are clear and consistently dramatized through ritualized tinkering and memory excavation. Interiority is specific and character-true—“helix-minded engineer” isn’t just a label but a lived cognition that structures every choice. The internal conflict between cautious redundancy and Mira’s audacity culminates in a credible, costly reorientation around “not fossilizing the living.” A touch more embodied reaction in the hardest memory layers could deepen the emotional cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archivist’s motivation—professional commission braided with personal “hunger”—is clear and consistently drives choices, especially the partial retreat with an avowed intent to return. Interiority is particular and embodied through perception (“numbers rustling in the mist,” “quiet bells” along the veins) rather than abstract labels. There is some internal tension between caution and compulsion, but it remains relatively smooth; contradictory impulses are present more as shading than as a sharply dramatized conflict. The final stance—accepting an incomplete haul and living with the ache to go back—reads earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sculptor’s vocation and ethos are vivid and particular—details like “apprenticed to sap and wind and patient wood” and reading alder like braille feel lived-in and specific. Motivation is clear and consistent: to create music in a silent, post-siren world through patience and listening. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (symphonic ambition vs. renunciation of grand crescendos), so the emotional stakes stay more meditative than pressured. The earned-stasis closure—returning tomorrow under the same vow—feels credible but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s characterization as an exiled, formerly overconfident tutor who has learned humility is sharply drawn and consistent, with exile and prior failure clearly motivating his painstaking method (“I had failed once, trusting speed…”). His internal conflict between fear of repeating that failure and commitment to the covenant is present but remains largely implied, never quite breaking into a sharp in-scene contradiction. The student is more gestural than fully personified yet still functions as a credible partner and moral witness, especially through her learned stillness and nonverbal choices. The final acceptance of custodianship feels earned and costs him continued vigilance under threat, though that cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to catalog silences as a pacifist alternative to force—is clear, consistent, and governs every micro-choice, especially the refusal to pry the clasp. Interiority is rich and particular (“the lamp likes applause,” “teaching my lungs to pace their miracles”), revealing a genuinely odd, specific mind. The internal conflict is quiet but present: attraction to spectacle versus commitment to gentler noise, embodied in the fireworks contrast. The final stance—accepting the empty diary and valuing the “clean hinge of their restraint”—feels earned and forecloses a more conventional hunger for narrative fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mara’s motives (testing her craft, cultivating serenity in motion, risking the village’s comfort) are specific and consistent, and her olfactory interiority feels genuinely idiosyncratic. The choice to plant the seed on the platform that “swayed hardest” is a clear value-revealing decision. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—her ambition versus communal risk could be sharpened with one more moment of genuine doubt or temptation. The late realization about ambition as a seed asking for a trellis is earned by prior beats and forecloses a more solitary, glory-seeking path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pilot’s vocation, ritual competence, and inherited promise create a specific, convincing inner life, and her micro-choices (launching at first pears, trusting the arrow tip, entering the chamber) all align with that drive. Motivation is clear and sustained, and the emotional charge around the mother’s relics is effective without sentimentality. What’s missing for a higher score is a more developed on-page contradictory impulse—she never seriously falters or doubts in the peak beat, so internal conflict remains relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The investigator’s motives and professional ethic are precise and compelling, and their methodical choices (mapping eddies, drafting the new order) clearly express character. The interiority is restrained but specific—“hazy precision” as a self-description is distinctive. What’s missing at a top-tier level is more on-page contradiction or visible emotional fracture under pressure; grief and duty are implied rather than dramatized in conflict. Still, endurance and renunciation (accepting the cost of the accident while pivoting to prevention) feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s role, desire (“to certify wonder as essential”), and ritual duties are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (when to strike, how to walk the aurora, how to “unfetter” the hush) feel rooted in that calling. Internal contradiction exists but remains fairly abstract—sleep vs. vigilance, duty vs. the seductive stillness—rather than dramatized as a sharp, felt struggle. The sculptor is powerfully evoked but more as a projected presence than a fully pressured second character. The ending offers an earned endurance/charged poise rather than a clear renunciation with visible cost, keeping this strong but not yet extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to re-approach her failure as a former guardian and “harvest insights” rather than hide it—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice from arranging driftwood to how she uses the flute. Her internal contradiction (still a “driven relic keeper” yet renouncing authority) is credible and dramatized rather than declared. The encounter with her alternate self and the decision to yield judgment to non-guardians earns the closing stance shift with visible cost: giving up ownership of the seam. The only slight limitation is that her emotional register stays mostly in one lyrical, composed gear, with little degradation or mess under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The operator and narrator are sharply etched through work habits, philosophy, and the eerie practice of borrowing traits, with motives (to quantify feeling, to help clients, to withstand the vanishing stars) consistent and particular. The cost to the operator—scratches from returned traits, risk of becoming “a bundle of types with no leading between them”—gives the interiority teeth. The narrator’s desire for “the mathematics of emotion” is embodied in on-page choices, especially consenting to the experiment that swaps their affective states. Internal contradiction is present but quiet (yearning for rigor vs. susceptibility to awe), which keeps this just shy of truly hair-raising complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courier’s interiority is vivid and particular—jitter, ethical scruples, and grief over the mentor all feel embodied in choices like lifting the pendant away at the peak moment. Motivation is clear (coaxing wonder vs. guarding against cost), and the conflict between using the tool and protecting the world’s “sharpness” is credibly held in tension. The relationship with the woman is brief but effective, giving us a focused crucible to test the courier’s values. The final stance—continuing the practice while living with absence—reads earned rather than epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara and the narrator are sharply etched: her grounded, methodical mysticism opposes his practiced skepticism in a way that feels lived-in rather than schematic. The narrator’s reluctance to admit sorrow and then to name his father is a credible, motivated progression with visible emotional cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“tasted like smoke and rain,” “a room after laughter leaves”) rather than labeled. The only minor limit is that the father’s specific history remains abstract, keeping the inner conflict just shy of devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The spinner’s longing, duty, and fear of losing the orchard are all concretely dramatized, with a clear internal conflict at the threshold (“Yet she stopped, sensing the orchard would die if she vanished”). Her choice to stay and send only the bead is fully motivated by earlier cues about sacrifice and responsibility. The emotional life is embodied more through image and action than explicit feeling labels, which works well for this mode. The relationship with the sister is mostly idealized, but the cost and depth of that bond are still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation and temperament are vivid and consistent—“my fear a quiet animal that understood work better than panic” encapsulates them well. Their choices (going underground against the elders, paying increasingly painful tithes) are clearly driven by this established nature. Internal conflict is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment contradiction. The cost of bartering memories and voice gives a credible, earned endurance arc, though a sharper on-page moment of hesitation could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s vocation and sensory worldview feel specific and embodied (“coolant smells of mint and burned dust”), and their motive—to trace the weight of withheld truth—clearly drives choices from investigation to opening the crate. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; there’s little real hesitation about releasing the voices, which slightly blunts psychological complexity at the climax. The late realization of being “built…to be a bridge” lands, but it comes as a clean reframe rather than a hard-won, contested insight. Strong, distinctive characterization, just shy of fully knotted, contradictory interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skipper’s reticence, duty, and tenderness are rendered with precise, embodied interiority (“the shape of silence a room makes when two men fail to say goodbye”). His motivation—to keep the “ache” of safety housed somewhere living rather than archived—is specific and consistent, culminating in the creation of the unburning lantern. Interiority is concrete and not generic; details like reading “the seams on a fuel drum” and the way Doyle avoids his eyes ground his emotional life. The only mild limitation is that the relationship with Doyle, while poignant, is mostly gestural rather than pressure-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority and motive are rich and specific: she is a joyful, scientifically grounded custodian whose vocation is both civic duty and inherited magic. Her accidental prophecy—laughing too soon—creates the central problem and reveals a credible flaw without melodrama. The balance of calm craft and real risk feels lived-in, though contradictory impulses under peak pressure (terror vs duty, doubt vs faith) stay mostly implied rather than dramatized in conflict on the page. The final craftsman’s faith in future storms reads earned, but the personal emotional cost could be shaded a hair more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and specific, with the donor heart embodied as “a startled bird in a nest I barely owned,” making the identity conflict feel grounded rather than abstract. Motivation (to understand why some people magnetize stories) is clear and consistently pursued through questions and attention. The dye master functions as a pressure-bearing mentor whose observations (“Your new rhythm is loud, but your questions step on tiptoe”) sharpen the protagonist’s self-contradictions. The closing shift from “patient” to “harbor” is earned by the accumulated ritual and counsel, with a believable emotional cost in accepting a receptive, echo-tuned self.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s role and motive—“a quiet trade of mops and maps” driven by the wish “to discover what trees witness”—are vivid, specific, and consistent. Interiority is textured through work habits (ledgers, envelopes, sweeping) rather than abstract feelings. However, internal conflict remains gentle; we don’t see sharply contradictory impulses under real pressure, only a steady, contemplative pursuit. The final stance feels earned but low-cost, more deepening than hard-won reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s vocation and fear are clear and consistent, and her choices (continuing the ritual despite the past failure and fear “as thin and cutting as mica”) drive the story. Interiority is vivid but more archetypal than individuated; we know her role and burden more than her idiosyncratic personality. The internal conflict—terror of another failure vs. obligation to rekindle the realm—is present but not deeply contested in on-page micro-choices; she never seriously wavers. The final endurance/emptiness beat feels earned, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s characterization is rich and specific: a “harbor that feared ships” whose guilt over a small but intimate error feels entirely her own, not generic. Her conflicting impulses—to hide, to mend, to reframe her mistake—are dramatized in choices (accepting the invitation, submitting to the library’s method, then going to the patron’s door). The silver-haired woman is lightly but effectively drawn as a steady counterpoint whose philosophy pressures Mara without erasing her. The only limit is that the story stays in a consistently gentle emotional register, so the internal struggle never quite feels jagged or risky enough for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s sensibility is rich and specific—the “creeping normality noticer” / “caretaker of thresholds” identity permeates how they move through the scene and what they confess. Motivation is clear (guilt over passive witnessing and a need to re-sanctify the ordinary), and actions—returning, tending, sharing, planning to come back seasonally—align with that. Internal conflict (activist guilt vs. gentle ritual, desire for absolution vs. suspicion of certainty) is present but mostly articulated rather than pushed into a sharp on-page dilemma. The relationships with Maro and Keziah are warm and sketched with a few deft touches, though they serve more as chorus and comrades than as real crucibles for painful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orderly records chief’s motive—“to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”—is concrete and consistently dramatized in choices to archive, to let go, and to revise metadata rather than falsify. Interiority is particular and embodied via cold, tools, and attention to minute data, not abstract emotion labels. The key internal turn (bringing their own vow under the same scrutiny they apply to others) feels earned by earlier scenes of testing and gentle judgment. The only slight limitation is that contradictory impulses (duty vs doubt, mercy vs rigor) remain implied rather than sharply dramatized in a single pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motivation is sharp and specific—she wants to capture "the sound of trust breaking," not revenge—and this anchors every choice she makes. Her curiously steadfast endurance under pressure (refusing to bolt, declining revenge) feels earned and consistent with the backstory about her father. The internal pivot from vengeance to "understanding sharp enough to thwart my future gullibility" is persuasive and rooted in scene work, not told epiphany. The only slight limitation is that contradictory impulses (vengeance vs. comprehension) are more stated than dramatized in direct on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The luminous skeptic’s motivation is clear and consistent—drawn north by doubt and curiosity—and their key choice (reading the ring, calling everyone to the spine) is earned. Interiority is particular and filtered through the taste-sense in a way that feels genuinely character-specific. The relationship with Naira is sketched efficiently and adds pressure via duty vs. skepticism, though their emotional stake in one another could deepen. The internal conflict (skepticism vs. longing to believe) is present but mostly conceptual, with limited embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is vivid and specific—“charcoal-fingered,” “gallery that always stays lit”—and the grief/creativity conflict feels lived-in rather than generic. Motivation to “uncork suppressed creativity” is clear and drives each micro-choice (descending, persisting after the lock fails, finally drawing). The internal change from paralysis to recommitment is earned and carries cost in confronting memories of Lio. There’s a touch of aphoristic neatness in a few realizations, but not enough to undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivations are vivid and consistent: a craftsperson whose body reacts to dishonesty, driven to locate “where lost conversations go” in a world where breath and words are currency. Interiority is specific and idiosyncratic (“I box up days when I am cruel,” “count which words still desire their sender”), giving her a distinct moral and sensory logic. Internal contradiction surfaces through her simultaneous professional pride, small cruelties, and hunger for truth, culminating in the confession about gilding a promise she did not believe. The closing endurance—accepting the role of honest conduit for deferred voices—feels earned, though the emotional cost of that role could be shaded a little more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is specific and memorable—“wore silence like a shawl,” seasonally mute, committed to music as non-bruising truth—and her actions track cleanly with that ethos. Her motivation (preserving wonder’s color) is explicit and embodied in her craft choices. Interiority stays mostly implied rather than conflicted on the page, so we get less live contradiction than top-tier pieces. Still, the closing moment with her palm on the melting fragment and her steady, unafraid silence feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The android’s motive—to resolve the “inner static” while honoring its archival duty—is clear, specific, and drives each choice, from opening the fear-box to staging the burn and stepping through the breach. Interiority is rich and particular (“a soft hiss like sand over glass”), with an effective contradiction between caretaker/curator and would-be escapee. The final choice to leave the dome and plant the first packet is earned by earlier ambivalence about remaining “a museum that never ends the tour,” with a visible cost in abandoning the dome. A slight limitation is that the relationship to the designer and the child-voice remains more conceptual than dramatized across an actual interaction, so that crucible is powerful but a bit one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s characterization as a listening, following-to-lead curator is vivid and consistent, and their choices (summoning benches, deferring to group memory, confronting the inspector with calm) clearly emerge from that nature. Interiority is lyric but concrete, with sensory metaphors that feel particular to this person’s vocation. Internal contradiction is relatively mild—the narrator rarely seems truly torn, which keeps the emotional range slightly narrow. Still, the final stance (keeping dawn benches ready) reads as an earned, character-specific continuation with real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—turning vulnerability into weaponized code and freeing the stored minds—is vivid and consistent, and their choices clearly drive the piece. Interiority is particular (salt, brine, rust, rhythm) rather than generic, and the relationship with Sora and Neri uses small, telling details. What’s missing for a higher band is more on-page contradiction under pressure; the narrator rarely feels genuinely torn or destabilized in the moment. Their competence goes largely untested, so the internal conflict remains more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilya’s motivation and interiority are vivid and specific—his mix of professional habit, superstitious training, and grief-driven curiosity feels lived-in and consistent. His micro-choices (following the grounds, waiting for gravity to slacken, deciding to carry the crystals to the whale) are clearly motivated and progressively bolder. Internal contradiction is present but quiet: he’s both complicit in civic forgetting and actively seeking remembrance, though this tension could be sharpened slightly. The final stance—serving as a kind of lantern lighter for memory as well as harbor—is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The summoner’s motivation—to divert the prophecy—is clear and consistently embodied in his methods, with his listening-led, modest temperament nicely implied through what he attends to. However, internal conflict is minimal; he never seriously doubts or feels torn, so his endurance at the end reads as extension rather than a charged renunciation. Emotional texture stays mostly in an elevated, contemplative register without many concrete bodily tells. The final resolve “to keep watch” feels apt but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator and tutor are vividly particular—his “never raised his voice and rarely blinked,” the sugar errand that “kept forgetting to finish,” and his practiced smile all feel lived-in and specific. Motivation (learning the language of old buildings) is clear and coherently pursued through small, ritual actions. Internal conflict is present but gentle; the narrator never feels truly torn or at risk, so the final promise, while believable, doesn’t carry a sharp personal cost. A touch more embodied ambivalence in the narrator—about ghosts, lies, or commitment—would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is richly specific—“charmed skeptic” and “keeper of proofs and improbable petals” is a precise contradiction that governs every choice. Motivation around Reina and the ethics of quarantine is clear and consistent, and the final decision to “become the door” feels earned by prior doubt and duty. Emotional states are embodied through interaction with the garden and shell rather than labels. The one limitation is that Reina, though vivid as presence, remains mostly emblematic rather than fully individuated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation is specific and consistent—balancing loyalty to their mentor, moral resistance to the empire, and a craftsman’s ethic (“calibrated treason”) gives them dimensionality. Internal conflict is present but subtle: the tension between mercy and treason, and between finishing the work and forgiving what’s left undone, feels lived-in rather than schematic. Embodied detail (the thorn pricking, the careful breath matching drips) grounds the lyricism in physical stakes. A slight limit is that, at this length, their flaws and potential for genuine error under pressure are more implied than dramatized in missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—to understand why some people echo and others swallow their names—is clear, consistent, and carries through to the confrontation with the council and the final teaching stance. Interiority is specific and sensorial (“throat tuned to hollows,” hearing “grief in crevices”), but internal contradiction is relatively underplayed; she rarely feels genuinely torn or complicit, which slightly softens the cost of her final resolve. The micro-choice where she tunes her note to the tallest councilor’s fear is an excellent, character-specific display of agency. The mother’s sacrifice and the narrator’s response are moving, but the emotional struggle around that revelation could bite deeper to feel fully crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation, temperament, and motive (“salvage something pure,” “ghosts prefer threads to nets”) are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices—coming to the shrine, placing the globe, promising to carry Leda’s name—track cleanly. Interiority is specific and embodied through sensory metaphor rather than labels. The relationship with the girl’s ghost acquires texture quickly and shifts from investigative to custodial in a believable way. The only thing keeping this short of the very top band is that her internal conflict (truth vs. erasure vs. self-salvage) is more implied than dramatized through real hesitation or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motivations are clear and particular—Li’s hunger, Yazhen’s quiet defiance, the philosopher’s devotion to “hidden effort”—and they drive every major beat, especially the choice to transform the “thief” hunt into a communal lesson. The internal conflict is more implied than dramatized (Li’s frustration with riddles, elders’ resistance) but still present. Relationships shift credibly from suspicion to collaboration, with status moving between Li, the philosopher, Yazhen, and the elders. The final communal adoption of new knots feels earned, though the emotional cost for Li personally could be slightly sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s mix of skepticism and reluctant empathy (“miracles make me itch” vs. her final concession on the names) gives her a specific, credible psychology. Klay reads as a man clinging to a story he needs to survive, with his refusal to enter the stillpoint and his shredding of letters revealing guilt and loyalty rather than exposition. Motivation is clean and consistent for both, and the final choice—tell the truth but soften the identifying details—feels earned by prior beats. The only slight limitation is that her internal conflict is largely intellectualized; we glimpse more stance than fully embodied turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and consistently expressed through choices like mentoring Kestrel and opening the “vault of ancient shadows.” Kestrel’s growth into “Prophet of Loose Ends” lands as a coherent arc though it’s mostly reported rather than deeply inhabited from the inside. There’s relatively little explicit internal conflict or embodied emotional texture under peak beats (e.g., when Kestrel is struck, we stay at a mythic distance). The final stance—remaining a “lonely visionary” offstage—feels earned but could carry more on-page emotional cost with a touch more contradiction or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motivation—to translate between generations and redeem his own “cheap” rhymes—runs cleanly through his choices, especially salvaging the music box, gifting the jar to the children, and opening specific jars during the storm. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, grounded in tactile actions (corking jars, mending labels) rather than abstract feeling labels. The internal change around redemption (“my first gleaned redemption… a quiet revision of who I could be for others”) feels earned by prior beats. The only ceiling is that his contradictory impulses under peak pressure (self-exile vs. need for community) could be dramatized a shade more sharply in-scene rather than mostly via reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s duty-bound, technically minded yet deeply feeling nature is vivid and consistent, and the Collector reads as hungry and wounded rather than flatly villainous. Micro-choices—opening the vault, choosing to demonstrate the Lens rather than fight, placing her hand on his knuckles—track cleanly with her braided motives of protection and compassion. The internal conflict between guarding the artifact and recognizing his bruised need is present in the scene, not just stated. The ending renunciation (she keeps the Lens, he leaves) feels earned and carries emotional cost for both.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to “sculpt patience from impatience” in a culture addicted to speed—is specific, consistent, and drives every major choice, from confronting the council to unyoking the dogs. Interiority feels lived-in and embodied through attention to ice, wind, and the viaduct rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Kerr is sketched economically but effectively, with status shifting from dismissal (“dream drunk”) to grudging respect. The only limitation is that internal contradiction under peak pressure (e.g., fear of failure vs conviction) could surface more viscerally at the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The investigator’s interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, with a clear hierarchy of values: professional rigor, ancestral obligation, and resistance to institutional pressure. Her contradictory impulses—wanting to stay “watchfully calm” and empirical while also honoring grief and legacy—operate simultaneously in scene, not as toggled summaries. The decisive choice to defy the director and call the union rep and journalist is fully earned by prior beats and carries an on-page career cost. A slight reliance on abstracted phrases (“controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) keeps this just shy of utterly lived-in perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The chaplain’s motivation is precise and morally specific, and his inner tension—wanting to help Hector without minimizing harm—is clear and consistent. Interiority is mostly articulated rather than embodied, but it still feels character-particular (e.g., “his apology has learned to walk”). Mara is sketched through action and demeanor more than backstory, which suits the length, though she remains slightly archetypal. The closing choice—to commit to a concrete, demanding plan rather than mere advocacy—feels earned by his earlier thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sera’s voice and motives are vividly particular—“merrily allergic to common sense,” driven by a “yearning algorithm”—and her choices clearly arise from this disposition. Internal contradiction is present but relatively soft (respect for people who “aim for dinner” vs her compulsion toward destiny), so she reads more as gloriously consistent than meaningfully torn. The closing sense of kinship with bell and sea is an earned deepening rather than a sharp turn, which fits the length but keeps the arc from fully peaking. Overall, the characterization feels publish-ready, with only a slight lack of on-page struggle under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich, specific, and ethically knotted: a “corporate memory keeper” who both tends to erasure and yearns to resist it. Her lie, unauthorized descent, and final choice to withhold Lia’s ledger are all clearly motivated by that tension between duty, curiosity, and complicity. Contradictory impulses—wanting justice, fearing surveillance, respecting Lia’s intent—coexist rather than resolving tidily. The cost of her Earned Stasis (choosing a “home rather than a punishment” for deletion) is legible as a moral wound she’ll continue to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is sharply drawn—a working peacekeeper whose humility, craft ethos, and refusal of performative neutrality consistently drive choices. Motivation is clear (translate empathy into action), and the decision to walk with both teams grounds that ideal in cost. Internal contradiction (neutrality vs intervention) is present but relatively gentle; there’s little genuine temptation to retreat into distant “watching.” The envoys are sketched economically rather than deeply individualized, but they serve the pressure well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives—coming as a euthanasia tourist yet staying to “learn the sound of approaching endings”—are specific, conflicted, and consistently dramatized through micro-choices like repeatedly postponing the appointment. Interiority is rich and embodied via sensory focus on wind, ice, and sound rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Mikko is lightly but effectively used as a crucible, pressing the narrator to articulate why they’re here and to listen differently. The final renunciation (postponing “not as surrender but as a seamstress’s pause”) feels fully earned and visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sentinel’s interiority is rich and particular—“keeper of pauses,” saving a single charred edge—so motives for listening and gentle intervention feel organic. The past misbelief about “destined mismatches” and the unsent letter give a credible fault-line that the present scene reworks. The traveler is lightly but effectively sketched via gesture and confession, though they accept guidance with minimal resistance, softening pressure. The final endurance—remaining a “reader of mist”—is an earned stance rather than a pat transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio is sharply etched—her scar, ethics, and refusal to “polish ruin into decoration” give her real dimensionality, and her honesty constrains her choices. The narrator’s interiority is thinner and largely deferential, more a finely tuned sensor than a fully conflicted agent. Motivation (to consecrate/preserve echo) is clear and consistent but rarely pulled into explicit inner contradiction or on-page dilemma. The understated shift at the end—accepting the ongoing task without worship—reads as a credible, if quiet, earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s motive—to curate an installation that can “breathe on its own” and hold communal grief—is clear, consistent, and enacted through specific choices (the spiral, the pacing, how she answers Ole). Interiority is textured and embodied (“tremble that travels with devotion”) without sliding into therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: a calm, ritualized exterior versus a deep, tremulous devotion that never fully destabilizes her. Secondary characters (Marta, Ole, the children) are economically but vividly drawn and apply real emotional pressure on the narrator’s project.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scholar’s motivation—to “decode the pattern of growth that kept threading through silence”—is clear, persistent, and enacted through concrete choices (borrowing the crystal, mapping echoes, deciding to testify). His reticence vs. obligation to speak before the custodians provides a quiet but credible internal conflict. Emotional textures are mostly implied rather than dramatized in bodily terms, but they remain consistent and character-specific. The final act of returning the crystal reads as an earned, character-true renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The junkyard prophet’s motivation—to capture the sound of growing older in the face of inevitable forgetting—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through micro-choices (chalk notes, driftwood arrows, obeying his own written commands). His precognitive forgetfulness gives him a distinctive interior logic and palpable vulnerability. The emotional life is mostly carried through image rather than explicit contradiction of impulses, so internal conflict is slightly muted rather than sharply dramatized. Still, the final endurance—following “what arrows remained and what chalk words he could still believe”—feels like an earned, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s competence, tenderness toward machines, and unresolved longing for Lina create a strong, particular interiority, with choices (e.g., “the repair was not only circuitry but posture”) clearly rooted in those traits. The internal conflict between mastery/control and the need to accept ephemerality is dramatized through how they handle the spinning clock and the leaf recording. The ending’s subtle shift—“a forgiveness I could not name” and “escape velocity from fear”—reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a flip epiphany. The only limitation is that Lina’s pressure is entirely off-page, so the relationship crucible is powerful but slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority and motive are crystal: the narrator’s “decisively kind” ethic, Ruth’s need for a controlled goodbye, and Lena’s fear of regret all drive concrete choices. The therapist’s micro-choices (calling twice, using the shard as a pick, engineering the goodbye) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Ruth’s shard-keeping as a way to “remember the sharp part” and her wish for a flawless cutoff embody credible contradictions. The reconciliation and the meticulous goodbye feel fully earned by what we’ve seen of each person.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The apprentice’s motivation (“to find where shadows go at noon”) is clear and consistently pursued through concrete choices—winding the Archivist, agreeing not to pry, building the model. Interiority is present but largely expressed via lyric observation rather than sharply dramatized internal conflict; we don’t see much genuine temptation to violate the Archivist’s warning. The renunciation at the end (to “relearn… through what I now refuse to take”) is credible and seeded, but the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally felt. The Archivist functions well as a gentle pressure rather than a fully developed counter-will.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—“forgiving skeptic,” hospital-trained bonesetter using folk magic—are integrated into every choice, from following Mara into the hedge to treating the fox. Motivation is clear and specific: repair the boy, repair the father’s trust, and repair their own earlier arrogance. The relationship with Mara and with the boy is delicately drawn through action and micro-choices rather than labels. The only restraint from an even higher score is that the emotional cost to the narrator (fear, guilt, risk) remains relatively gentle and controlled rather than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motive—to tend tidal light after losing the sky—is specific, embodied, and threads through every choice, culminating in how they handle the pearl. The internal conflict around keeping vs releasing the hush is clearly dramatized as a values trade-off (safety vs song) rather than a tidy epiphany. Interiority is concrete and particular (“learns stars through their reflections,” “listen sideways”), not diagnostic or generic. The endurance at the end—accepting being earthbound while deepening the vocation—reads as earned stasis with a felt cost rather than an easy consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s motives—to live differently after the viral confession by converting shame into sustained, practical care—are specific and consistent, and micro-choices (bringing the pendant, accepting Miri’s invitation, declining immediate further public speaking) feel earned. Internal contradiction between public “bravery” and the smaller bravery of ongoing practice is clear and active. The relationship with Miri is delicately drawn, with status and care implied through gesture (“as if my hand were a nest”). The only slight limitation is that their internal conflict never spikes into a truly pressured dilemma; it remains controlled and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflicted novelist’s motivation—to face abandoned work and “collect the shapes of different hopes”—is specific and drives every beat, from wading against the current to refusing an “easy ending.” Interiority is rich and character-particular, with self-implication (“that was not mercy, that was erasure”) and a final, earned shift toward self-forgiveness. Cameo characters apply real pressure by confronting past choices (the girl’s accusation, the fisherman’s laughter), not just decorating the scene. The only limitation is that emotional conflict stays largely on a lyric register rather than showing more degraded, messy thought under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lio’s characterization as a whimsical yet deeply competent ritualist is vivid and consistent, and his joy-inflected seriousness about obligation feels particular rather than generic. His motivation—repairing a “strained covenant with place”—is clear and carries through to his choices with the vine, the spindle, and ceding the spindle to the child. However, his internal conflict stays relatively mild; the “snag” around the vow’s direction is more a technical hitch than a value-cost dilemma. The villagers and child function effectively as a chorus and catalyst, but their individual psychologies remain mostly gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s motivation (mother’s map, missing brother, heartbeats-as-roads) is vivid and consistent, and her actions track closely with those motives. Interiority is largely embedded in ritual detail instead of explicit thought, which suits the mode but slightly mutes contradictory impulses. Her patience, reverence for objects, and long-term grief feel particular rather than generic. The closing choice to set out east with the map reads fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The locksmith’s motivation and worldview are sharp and specific, and his occupational lens (“sworn to make keys for doors that refuse to admit ordinary curiosity”) roots the voice. However, his inner life remains largely unconflicted; he moves from intention to execution with little visible ambivalence or emotional cost. The “risk” of the deeper voices is asserted but not really felt in his body or choices. The endurance/change at the end is conceptually clear but emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Fractal weaver’s motives and internal conflict—service to the valley vs. the cost of staying—are clear, specific, and consistent with the world’s rules. Emotional experience is conveyed more through metaphor than bodily detail, but the contradictions (trapped vs. chosen binding, freedom vs. circle) are legible. The final acceptance of “a circle so wide it feels boundary-lessly trapped” feels earned by prior beats of orientation and burden-measuring. A touch more concrete embodiment of stress or doubt could deepen the character further.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The widow’s interiority is specific, embodied, and driven by a clear tension between holding on and letting go (“contain what refuses containment,” door left ajar). Her micro-choices—carving the cage, deciding to place the mane and sugar inside, pocketing the finished piece—are tightly motivated by grief and craft. The relationship to the absent husband feels lived-in through concrete memories (the broken wrist, the sugar shards, his laugh). The only thing keeping this just short of the very top band is that her internal contradiction remains relatively stable rather than being tested to a breaking point on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motives and contradictions are sharply etched: she’s pulled between restarting the grind that “sanded her hopes to nubs” and letting the world go dry, and that tension persists through micro-choices (turning the wheel again, countering the ghost, paying with a cherished vow). Her interiority is specific and embodied (“regret is a soft tool in a place that worships torque”), and the ghost functions as a credible, resistant version of her. The final choice to restart the carousel and pay with a formative memory is well prepared by prior mentions of eroded ambitions and old dreams. A hair more visceral emotional fallout at the end could deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation (“to puzzle out new equations for hope”) is clear and consistently embodied through concrete engineering choices, and her competence feels specific and earned. Interiority is vivid but leans more toward assured purpose than contradictory impulses, so internal conflict remains relatively low-pressure. Her micro-choices (repurposing the sextant, rerouting panels, inviting the boy into the system) reveal values in action. The endurance-style change at the end—settled, ethically steady hope—is credible and well prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scribe’s motivation (to reconcile a forbidden musical impulse with a life of sanctioned silence) is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices with the bell feel earned by the established temperament and history. The internal contradiction—guardian of hush who longs for resonance—runs through the whole piece and resolves in an “earned stasis” where she remains the clock scribe but redefines that role. Embodied emotion is mostly carried through tactile engagement (stroking the bell, breathing with the forecourt) rather than labels, which suits her controlled nature. If anything, she reaches insight very smoothly; a slightly messier or riskier emotional beat could deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s motivation (salvaging “the truest” stories and exposing the “architecture of lies”) is clear and consistent, and their micro-choices—from following the sundial’s scratches to staging the confrontation—align with that drive. Internal conflict between “rage and a colder patience” surfaces at the key moral hinge and meaningfully shapes tactics. The watchman is sketched with a few vivid details that give him specificity and moral weight without stealing focus. The main limitation is that the emotional cost to the narrator remains more implied than embodied, keeping the arc just shy of fully piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The collector’s motive (preserving ancient methods) is clear and consistently embodied in their meticulous listening and teaching, and the fisherman has a legible mini-arc from skepticism to committed ally. Interiority is specific and rooted in concrete perception (“less book than wind, salt, and germinating chance”), not abstract labels. The relationship functions as a crucible: his council deadline presses against the narrator’s patience, forcing them into collaborative, faster decoding. Internal conflict is present but subtle; a slightly sharper sense of personal emotional risk or doubt at the climax could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and specific—“my heart is a coastline rewritten by storms”—and their motive (to map the “geography of healing”) coherently drives choices from accepting the work to deciding to stay. Mira is sketched with a few precise, affecting details (husband’s wave “without color,” the scar that catches rain) and she exerts real emotional pressure. Contradictory impulses—leaving vs. staying, witnessing vs. disappearing into others’ stories—are dramatized rather than merely stated. The final endurance choice (staying as the ships are gone) feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prince’s motives (devotion to machines vs secret hunger for beauty) are sharply drawn and consistently drive his choices, especially the refusal to surrender the egg. Interiority is specific and embodied (“my heart clattered like panicked cutlery”) rather than generic. His final stance—accepting compromise as “survival with music”—feels earned by prior realizations about their mechanical genesis. The only slight limitation is that his internal conflict rarely manifests as simultaneous, in-the-moment contradiction under direct confrontation with another character.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s characterization as an “arsonist’s daughter firefighter” is rich, coherent, and drives every choice, from her meticulous grafting to how she handles the boy’s questions. Motivation—to transform inherited harm into care—is clear and steadily embodied rather than merely asserted. The relationship with the boy is finely observed and alters both of them without slipping into sentimentality. If anything, she is a touch uniformly wise/centered, with very little visible irrationality or loss of control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s mix of empirical skepticism and quiet susceptibility to ritual (“refused to worship anything I could not test” vs. telling a statue a secret) creates lived, specific contradiction. Motivation—to wake the city by liberating memories—is clear and consistent, and the father fear/identification gives the key emotional turn weight. The realization about the father (“he had been afraid because he loved too hard”) reconfigures her stance in a way that feels earned by prior details. The only slight limitation is that internal conflict stays mostly implied rather than fully dramatized in on-page hesitation or missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The caretaker’s interiority is specific and coherent, with a clear value hierarchy around grief, inheritance, and gentleness that motivates every choice. The stranger’s backstory of “gardens burned” and her fracture-then-reform reaction at the orrery add credible counterpressure without melodrama. Internal change—the narrator moving from hoarding echoes to curating a transmissible tradition—is legible and earned. The piece could push further into simultaneous contradictory impulses under peak pressure; most conflict is reflective rather than acutely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The carver’s motive (“to discover the shape of collective grief”) is specific and persistently dramatized through her ritualistic process and choices. Interiority feels lived-in and particular—her slowness, listening, and relationship to her grandmother’s craft are convincing. Internal contradiction is present but soft (reverent patience vs. the implicit pressure to “finish what had no edge”), so peak-cost emotion could be sharpened slightly. Still, the final choice to loosen the braid and prioritize receptive hollows over declarative form reads as an earned stance with real, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    The keeper’s motivation—ethically precise maintenance of the town’s time as a form of penitence—is vivid and consistent, and his interiority is specific rather than generic. The core contradiction (his professional diligence versus his unresolved personal guilt) is dramatized in the choice about his own pellets: “Now the handle tells me to spare no pellet for my part, not yet, not before I listen.” His actions always align with this value system and flaw. The final stance—continuing to bear some weight while vowing to “keep time without cruelty”—reads as an earned, costly renunciation rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rowan’s gentleness, obsessive orderliness, and vocation as a listener are clear and consistently dramatized, and his core motive—to “discover the shape of intentions”—credibly drives every choice. The key interior turn is the decision to reinterpret the chess tutor’s final act and physically “carry the king half a square,” which is well earned by prior setup with the tapestry and case. What’s slightly missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of Rowan’s own contradiction or cost beyond quiet weariness; he reads a bit saintly and unopposed. A hint of personal stake or blind spot would deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s vocation, ethics, and temperament are clearly defined and consistently expressed through their mapping practice and their refusal to write rigid decrees. Motivation is specific—seed innovation within limits—and their choices with the Council (trellis vs. wall, civic laboratories) arise organically from that. Internal conflict is present but mild: anxiety about harming the city vs. pressure to provide certainty, without a sharply dramatized moment of near-capitulation. The final stance feels earned, though the cost of defying or disappointing the Council remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and coherent: the “diligent orchestra copyist” whose craft, caution, and quiet defiance consistently motivate her choices. Her professional mindset grounds the world’s rules (annotating lyrics, sensing where “pages wanted ink heavier”). Internal contradiction is relatively muted—she mostly embodies steadfastness rather than tension—but for this length the endurance arc reads earned. The cost of her stance is implied in the risk she takes when she “refus[es] to cloak her answer,” though that cost could be made a touch more personal or fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is sharply etched: their role, ethics, and ritualized practice feel particular and lived, and Soren reads as a distinct, wounded presence despite relatively little on-page time. His evasions (“stories that do not meet in the middle”) and fixation on the mask make his internal conflict legible without over-explaining. The final barter—he wants safety, the narrator offers a mirage and ash—feels like a credible, costly stance rather than a neat cure. The only small limit is that we glimpse the narrator’s own emotional stakes (re: their mother) only briefly at the end, so their personal cost remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s characterization is vivid, particular, and consistent: a sewer-dwelling rationalist whose choices (keeping the cog, refusing both factions, teaching children) clearly arise from his ethos. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“I trap them carefully, bellies up, to study their teeth”), and the mix of bitterness, care, and stubbornness feels earned. Internal conflict is present but quiet—he “agonize[s] without drama,” yet the cost of isolation is more implied than dramatized. The final endurance choice (to keep living below and making clocks) reads as an earned stasis with believable trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    The teacher’s interiority is specific and embodied—“expectantly resigned to the slow work of listening” is borne out in her patient, risky facilitation of the session. Reza and the nurse are sketched with economical but pointed detail, and their voiced fears feel psychologically credible. The shift in the teacher’s relationship to “expectantly resigned” by the end reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a neat epiphany. The only ceiling here is that we sense more of her vocation than of her deeper personal contradictions beyond this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Characterization is rich and specific: the chef’s memory-tasting, bartered rain-memory, and philosophy of “gentle rebellion” create a vivid psyche, and Kye’s conflict with their Quiet Diet father feels grounded. Motivation is consistent and actions track cleanly to values (opening the greenhouse, planting the seed, feeding Kye). Internal contradiction is present but muted; the protagonist’s cost (losing a core memory) lives more in concept than in dramatized ambivalence. A slightly greater sense of strain or risk in the moment of transgression would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The keeper’s blend of constraint (involuntary truth) and chosen vocation (collecting wonder) feels particular and governs his every move, while Mara’s practical worry provides a grounded counterweight. Their motives are clear and specific—restore the bees/tower, preserve wonder—not generic “save the city” heroism. The truth-compulsion meaningfully shapes their relationship and his options (he cannot simply take easy payment or offer comforting lies). Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized moment-to-moment, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s vocation and motivation (“creeping normality noticer,” wanting to know why houses feel alive) are precise and consistent, and micro-choices—what to move, what to leave, what to carry away—reveal character. Emotional life is mostly implied rather than directly dramatized, but the sense of reverence, responsibility, and quiet loneliness is still legible. There’s limited overt internal contradiction under pressure, which keeps this just below the very top tier for characterization at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator-statue has a clear, particular interior life, and their motivation—to unbraid certainties and carry nuance through the city—is consistent and active. Emotional texture is more conceptual than bodily, but still specific (“softened my edges,” “threading intent along their hairline cracks”). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (loyalty to sculptor vs. undoing his certainty) rather than dramatized as sharp, simultaneous impulses. Secondary figures like the bishop and the tin fish are vivid but lightly sketched, serving function more than deep relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s grim optimism, self-lacerating intellect, and refusal to either leap or freeze are consistently dramatized through choices (taking the bargain, endlessly rewriting the proof). Motivation—turning a missed opportunity into something “salvageable”—is clear and threads through all actions. Internal contradiction (hope vs. penance, motion vs. confinement) is active rather than summarized. The only minor limit is that we never see the other person on-page, so relational stakes stay abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Anya’s characterization is rich and embodied—her “methodically hopeful” nature is dramatized through routines (shelving seeds, keeping a ledger) rather than labels. The visitors are sketched quickly but distinctly, each revealing a different facet of what she’s trying to prove. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—her quiet fatigue vs. persistent tending—so the psychological stakes never quite bite as hard as they could. Still, her final inkless vow feels fully earned by prior behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to preserve endangered art for displaced people—is clear and consistently embodied in choices, especially the decision to defy the beekeeper’s warning and lead the crossing. Interiority is specific and textured, with fear, duty, and reverence braided rather than cleanly separated (“waiting felt like erasure”). The relationship with the children and grandmothers, though not individuated, still functions as a credible crucible that sharpens responsibility. The final shift from seeing the museum as an ark to a stage reads as an earned evolution of stance rather than an imposed epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation (bring sister home / step beyond fate) is clear and consistent, and their inventive stubbornness is dramatized through specific choices (rebuilding the clockwork, binding the yoyo to the pendulum, feeding the stone regrets). Internal contradiction—rescue versus accepting a rendezvous and new duty—is present, though more implied than fully dramatized in on-page hesitation. The relationship with the sister is eerie but affecting, with her refusal and backward speech giving their bond a specific, charged texture. The final endurance—choosing to live as keeper in reverse time with ongoing cost—feels earned by prior traits and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, specific, and consistent, especially around the intertwined motives of confronting fear and honoring the dead ringmaster (“I loved the ringmaster more than breath or water”). The protagonist’s contradiction—needing the advisor/fear while trying to destroy it—plays out in choices (entering the maze, confessing, trapping fear). Emotional embodiment is vivid and idiosyncratic (river coins in lungs, paramedic’s hands echoing in ribs). The final renunciation—thanking the advisor and walking away—feels fully earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prophet’s vocation, vow (“he swore then to barter with weather”), and method-driven agency are vivid and consistent, and his choices clearly drive the scene. His emotional life is embodied more through attentiveness to sound and environment than through explicit feeling, but it still reads as particular and human. The memory of his father adds depth and a quiet internal tension between control and humility, though contradictory impulses under peak pressure could be sharper. The closing stance—gratitude and ongoing vigilance rather than triumph—feels earned but remains subtle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive—shifting from “pretending to be patience” to acting—is clear, specific, and drives concrete choices (cracking the latch, blowing the whistle, touching the watcher). Interiority is textured through images rather than labels (“my mouth taste of copper and prayers”), though we don’t see much true in-scene vacillation once the choice is made. The cost lands as a quiet endurance rather than a sharp break: she accepts that her teacher is gone yet woven into the routes, and chooses to carry “sunwashed dread” as a tool. Depth is strong for this length and mode, but there’s room for slightly more felt friction at the peak decision.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara and Tomas both feel specific and motivated: her “fictional historian” stance and hired-in-whispers reputation are clear, and Tomas’s investment in the noble lie is credible. Their relationship functions as the core crucible, with his initial resistance and eventual cooperation dramatizing the town’s split loyalties. However, Mara’s interior conflict is lightly handled—she remains mostly assured, with only brief flashes of heat that she quickly “cools with numbers,” so the cost of her choice is more thematic than deeply emotional. A bit more embodied contradiction in her—fear of hurting people vs. compulsion to reveal—would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to measure and to “become the archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is clear, particular, and consistently expressed in both choices and perception. His internal tension between professional duty and what might be “vandalism” provides a quiet but credible conflict. “Stoically sensitive” is enacted rather than merely stated (e.g., his attentiveness to “hairline tremors of silt and memory”). The one limitation is that his internal contradiction never quite sharpens into a truly risky emotional decision, keeping the arc just shy of revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motivation—to establish “honest origins” rather than seek revenge—is precise and sustained, and the internal conflict between rage and method (“revenge writes crooked”) is cleanly dramatized. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, with professional habits (indexing, hypothesis trees) shaping emotion. The emotional temperature stays relatively cool and cerebral, so the cost of renouncing rage is more conceptual than felt in the body. Still, the final stance—choosing careful truth over family grievance—reads as earned stasis with a credible, if quiet, price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s grief, craft-identity, and abandonment by their shadow create a clear, particular psychology, with embodied emotion in images like “dress in ache” and fingers becoming “thin maps.” Motivation—to process Lio’s loss via work, tea, and cranes—is consistent and escalates naturally into the thousand-crane project. Internal contradiction (tending others’ dreams while their own will not perch; wanting light yet suffering “luminous torment”) is present but could be pushed slightly harder in direct on-page dilemma. The final acceptance—continuing lantern work with a reconfigured relationship to grief and shadow—feels earned and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s trauma, professional purpose, and ethical revulsion fuse into a very specific psyche; “drone strike wedding survivor” plus the geode as wedding gift roots everything in her history. Her conflicting motives (grant/board vs ghosts vs self-preservation) surface in concrete choices, culminating in refusing extraction and signing “unwilling to be a weapon,” which feels fully earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“taste iron in my mouth,” “the past is a vacuum pump”) rather than diagnostic. The only slight limit is that her relationship with Liyun stays thinly sketched, so the relational crucible is underused.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motive (“decode the frequency of belonging”) is clear and consistently drives choices, and the pilgrim’s long, costly stewardship of the chip reads as embodied devotion. Their relationship develops subtly through mutual dependence—pilot needs the pilgrim as anchor; pilgrim needs the pilot’s machines as interpretive tools. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized, but the pivot realization (“it can only cast the spaces”) earns the final stance. The emotional palette could afford one sharper, more embodied moment of fear or doubt to fully match the conceptual sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s guilt, professional self-disgust, and compulsion toward truth are vividly particularized (“hair shirt I earned with every forgery”). His motivation to reopen the case and confront his complicity is clear and coherently escalates toward the decision to write to Mara and refuse to “sell [his] silence.” Internal contradiction—his instinct to fabricate versus his new commitment to fact—is dramatized rather than simply told. The only slight limitation is the absence of another on-page character to actively pressure him in real time, which keeps the crucible somewhat internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The negotiator is sharply etched: patient, guilt-ridden, and rigorously committed to neutrality, with motives that clearly drive each choice. Interiority is concrete and specific (grandmother, the mothers, the ledger) rather than generic. Internal contradiction—duty vs. guilt, haste vs. care—is present but could be pressed harder at peak beats for even more dramatic friction. Neris, Bram, and Daro are efficiently but distinctly characterized under pressure, with Daro’s refusal providing the clearest crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—to face his sister and own the navigation error—flows cleanly from his history and flaws, and his contradictory impulses (avoidance vs. duty; faith vs. self-sabotage) operate simultaneously rather than in tidy sequence. The mother’s Polaris lesson and his habit of “beginning and terrible at arriving” elegantly ground his choices on the water and in the final walk home. The sister, though minimally voiced, functions as a real relational counterweight whose quiet act of closing the compass credibly alters the emotional temperature. The only thing holding this just short of the top band is that her interiority and the direct, in-scene cost to the relationship remain mostly implied rather than briefly dramatized in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s guilt, conflicted desire for a reset, and refusal of easy absolution are vivid and specific (“starting over felt like theft too”). His actions—submitting to the procedure, seeking the lake, confessing the fire, releasing the vial—cleanly align with his motivation to “kindle empathy” while preserving moral ambiguity. Interiority is concrete, image-driven, and avoids therapy-speak, with conscience and memory in productive tension. The arc lands as an earned shift toward difficult repair, not a neat redemption, though the brother thread could be pushed slightly harder as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motivation—to reforge a bond beyond death—is clear, persistent, and tested against her reluctance to metamorphose, giving the piece a strong internal crucible (“Grief wants me to break; love wants me to bend”). Interiority is particular and embodied via spices, animals, and memory, rather than abstracted emotion labels. The beloved is more an idealized presence than a fully dimensional character, but functions effectively as the pressure point on the narrator’s choices. The final choice to “live between names” and accept avian form reads earned and costly, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motives—seeking where lost time accumulates, reconciling joy and dread after birth—are precise and consistently dramatized in concrete ritual choices (climb, reading, collecting minutes). Interiority is vivid and particular, with genuine contradiction (“willingly perplexed,” longing for rest yet compelled to map the braid). The final stance—a costly vow to “spend what I learned to recover”—feels earned by prior beats. The only small limit is that the narrator’s flaws (e.g., impulse toward magical control) are not tested by any active interpersonal resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s motives—protecting the last child and opening the locked dimension without harm—are clear, consistent, and deepen as pacifism, grief, and responsibility braid together. Interiority is specific and embodied through images like “learned to hold broken things without closing a fist” and the gravitational lightness of joy. The internal conflict between the warhead’s violent solution and the narrator’s vow is credible and resolved via costly endurance rather than a neat epiphany. A slight reliance on abstract phrasing (“shadow work does not spare”) keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s characterization is vivid and particular—the “destitute philanthropist” whose currency is attention and coincidence feels fresh and internally consistent, and her calm, craftlike relation to prophecy is intriguing. Her motives for helping (to “touch change”) link cleanly to her habits of arranging tools and people in advance. The boy and mother are sketched more functionally than deeply, but they serve as credible pressure rather than props. Internal contradiction is present but quiet—she resists prophecy yet keeps sliding into it—so the arc lands as a nuanced endurance rather than a sharp transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lock sentinel’s motives (loyalty to locks vs. commitment to a quiet revolution) are clear and consistent, and his calm inventiveness is nicely dramatized in checking the sundial and repurposing the quill holder. Interiority is vivid and particular (“fear tries to giggle,” listening to what metal “means to say”) rather than generic. However, internal contradiction under real pressure is more implied than fully dramatized—things go almost too smoothly for that conflict to truly bite on the page. Secondary characters (clerks, porters, baker) remain atmospheric rather than active pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motivation is vivid and specific—the binding promise and the drive to “hear the shape of gravity in the numbers” clearly govern every choice—but internal contradiction under pressure stays more implied than dramatized in scene. The precognitive curse and the love/pattern impulse intersect nicely (“not love alone, though love weaves through it”), yet moments where competing impulses truly clash on the page are limited. The relationship with “she” is strong conceptually but she is mostly an emblem until the closing beat, so the relational crucible is a bit underused. Still, the final shared holding of the bowl feels earned by the prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ilya’s motivation—to reclaim and re-map censored language—is clear, embodied, and drives every choice from the climb to the final reading. His interiority is specific and metaphorically rich (seeing redactions as constellations) rather than generic. The internal conflict between learned silence and the urge to speak is present but mostly implied, not fully dramatized in moments of hesitation. Mara is vivid and thematically apt, but her own stakes and contradictions stay thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s motivations (commission, commitment to ceasefire, desire to “turn questions into destinations”) are clear and consistently drive choices, especially in offering the card rather than pressing the advantage. The courier’s arc from antagonist to co-conspirator is sketched efficiently through action and a few revealing lines (“his voice softer than his medals”). Emotional life is largely conveyed through metaphor and stance rather than concrete bodily sensation, which keeps some reactions slightly abstract. Still, micro-choices under pressure (refusal to humiliate, rehearsing “how to speak without corners”) reveal a credible hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Both the narrator and Mara are sharply etched through specific history (prison library, trespasser status) and present-tense choices, and their motivations—to reclaim the library as resistance and refuge—are consistent and felt. The “molts personalities monthly” trait adds texture and a hint of internal conflict, but it never fully constrains a choice, so contradiction stays thematic rather than dramatized. The relationship is the crucible for action: Mara’s quiet trauma around bars and cells and the narrator’s lyrical defiance interlock in the rebuilding. The closing shift into “keepers of doors” reads earned and character-rooted, though the emotional cost could be shaded more explicitly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pianist’s grief, guilt, and stubborn romanticism are specific and consistent, with the clock, bench, and music all reflecting his interior stakes. His agency—choosing to run the reel, to play the unfinished prelude, to ask Mara for time rather than explanations—feels motivated by that mix of longing and self-blame. Contradictory impulses (wanting Mara back, fearing causality, distrusting “crushing causality under song” yet trying anyway) are present, though not always pushed to explicit crisis. Mara is lightly but effectively etched as a counterpart rather than an equal focal character.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator’s professional role and core motive (“to protect cultural memory”) are clear and consistent, and the choice to stay when others leave gives a credible endurance-with-cost beat. Interiority is vivid but more declarative than conflicted; we’re told she lives in “luminous doubt” more than we see her pulled between incompatible impulses in the moment. Relationships with villagers and elders are sketched symbolically rather than as individuated frictions, which keeps emotional stakes somewhat abstract. Still, the final decision to remain as reality checker feels earned by the prior ritual and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s motive—finding a color to embody an unsaid apology to Mara—is specific, consistent, and quietly intensifies as the ritual proceeds. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“we spoke less so roots could hear,” “regret can be a way to tend and not to cut”). The conflict between his habitual restraint and the need to finally “speak” through the ritual is clear, though his contradictory impulses could be dramatized a bit more overtly under peak pressure. The final inward turn of the compass and his choice to let the words go where he “would not control” reads as an earned, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The neutron star researcher persona completely saturates the narrative voice, filtering the mundane tragedy of a ruined greenhouse through a unique lens of "gradients," "spin," and "decay." The choice to "strip drama" is not just a stated motive but is dramatized through the triage process, treating the disaster as a slope rather than a cliff.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The character relies on diagnostic self-definition ("I am steadily adaptive," "I am not a detective") rather than dramatized traits, which distances the reader. Motivation is explicitly stated ("I wanted to discover purpose") rather than emerging from friction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s motivation is visceral and deeply rooted in the backstory of the capsize; the "vow" to translate silence drives every on-page choice. The internal conflict—fearing the heart has become a drifting buoy vs. the active effort to "rectify distances"—is resolved with earned resonance in the final beat. Sura functions perfectly as a complementary presence, her "language of winter" enhancing the protagonist's arc without cluttering the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "weary undertaker" voice is established instantly and serves as a perfect anchor for the fable-like tone. While the protagonist's internal landscape is rich, the specific attribute "inadvertently stubborn" is told rather than dramatized, and the sudden manifestation of the "occupying" ability at the climax feels more like a convenient magic system reveal than a grounded character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara and the elders are clear archetypes, but the dialogue drifts into unnatural didacticism ("we do this to build intergenerational support"). Noor’s internal conflict resolves too smoothly ("lighter than his doubts") without sufficient on-page struggle or behavioral residue.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrator is clearly defined as an artist-shaman, but the character arc lacks friction; the friend and the spirit-woman are compliant facilitators who offer no resistance. Without contradictory impulses or reluctance, the "healing" feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The explicit "bellows stitched to ribs" suggests a visceral physical cost that is not fully dramatized in the emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct and lyrically consistent, establishing a strong fable-like interiority. However, the core motivation ("texture of time") remains slightly abstract, and the emotional anchor (the "wet bootprint") is brief, making the personal stakes feel more theoretical than visceral until the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's decision to chain himself to the bench is a masterful beat of characterization, transforming a symbol of oppression into a tactical asset. This choice validates the "chained liberator" moniker through action rather than exposition, demonstrating high agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character interiority is exceptional, filtering every emotion through the specific synesthetic condition ("greens whispered tin"). The protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in the backstory of abandonment, and the final choice to accept the "honest and cold" truth demonstrates earned maturity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist functions more as a metaphorical conceit than a fully realized character. The twist that the thief and the traveler are the same person ("the you was me") collapses the external conflict into solipsism without clarifying the psychological stakes. The "mother" motivation is introduced late and feels like an abstract plot device rather than a deeply felt bond.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is internally consistent but static, lacking the "contradictory impulses acting simultaneously" required for higher bands. The conflict is entirely retrospective (past critique vs. present safety); with the environment explicitly described as "kindly teachers," the character faces no present-tense pressure to force a revealing choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between fear and professional competence is compelling, and agency is high in the climax. However, the leap in capability—from stunt performer to cryptographer decoding a child's cast—strains credibility and feels unearned by established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scribe and oracle function effectively as archetypal vessels for the theme but lack deep internal friction or visceral exteriority. While the scribe’s shift from control ("stabbing lines") to acceptance ("summarizing silence") is coherent, it feels like a gentle instruction rather than a crucible of character. The "mildly obsessed" trait is stated as a label rather than dramatized through costly behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to find the physical origin of thought—is distinct and drives the narrative logic from the first paragraph to the final realization. Internal agency is strong; JN-3 subverts the city’s efficiency quotas not through rebellion but through a specific, character-driven choice (slowing down). The voice maintains a coherent, "remarkably composed" persona that unifies the robotic and the mystic without slipping into generic sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist has a clear, stated motivation ("thaw mistrust"), but their internal landscape is largely conveyed through atmospheric metaphor rather than grounded psychological struggle. The "shaking fingers" offer a glimpse of embodiment, but the emotional risk feels somewhat abstract compared to the heavy thematic lifting. The character functions well as a poetic observer but lacks the grit of a fully realized agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist is sharply defined not just by his role but by his internalized history of "mended deception." The confession of past lies prevents him from being a mere wise-elder trope, grounding his current resistance in specific, flawed humanity. His motivation—to prove the reciprocity of the garden—drives every on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Hale is a clearly defined protagonist with a distinct, if singular, motivation. However, the lack of internal contradiction or interpersonal friction with Sera leaves the characterization feeling somewhat static; they agree on everything, reducing the potential for "relationships as crucible." The trait "mechanically warm" acts more as a repeated label than a driver of complex behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—professional obedience versus supernatural intuition—drives a high-stakes decision (playing the discordant harmonic) that feels earned and character-specific. The "lately inspired" trait is not just a label but is dramatized as a heightened sensitivity that compels the climax, showing strong agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is deeply embodied, blending the fever state with the mechanical environment to dramatize grief. The protagonist's shift from suppression to action is earned through the tactile ritual of weighing the dust, making the internal change visible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the internal conflict between skepticism and the "liturgy" of the search is compelling. However, the self-identification as "reckless" contradicts the methodical, surveyor-like caution demonstrated in the scene; the label feels applied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist possesses a distinct, lyrical voice and a clear philosophical arc moving from recording to tending. However, the character feels somewhat archetypal and sage-like, lacking the raw, contradictory interiority or specific personal flaws that create deep emotional friction. The "human ink" realization is beautiful but arrives through observation rather than a visceral, messy struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or flaws, functioning as an idealized "wise healer" without visible vulnerability. The emotional arc for the clients is observed rather than felt through the narrator's own struggle, resulting in a static character dynamic. There is no moment where the narrator's competence is truly tested or risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The historian functions effectively as a "sensor" for the story's dense imagery, fitting the lyric mode. However, the internal landscape is somewhat static; his specific oddity and interior friction are asserted ("sensitively perceptive") rather than fully dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mei functions as a competent archetype rather than a fleshed-out character; she faces no internal doubt, contradiction, or genuine risk. Her ability to "orchestrate arrival" works instantly without friction, making her success feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned narrative victory.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary; Ruan’s specific methodology (loop pedal theology) defines his agency and worldview without exposition dumps. The antagonist is given a distinct, coherent philosophical stance ("hunger for the flat") rather than generic malice. The conflict drives a clear internal shift for the entity, earning the resolution through character-specific traits.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's specific interiority ("folded compass pointing inward") brilliantly bridges the fortune-cookie writer backstory with the conductor's present action. The ache of "chronological homesickness" is embodied in physical exertion, driving the climb with visceral motivation rather than abstract longing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lio’s arc of renunciation—trading his gravity-defying nature for a mortal arrival—is a strong, earned decisive change. However, the secondary figures (mother, lover, alternate selves) function largely as symbolic props rather than fully realized characters, slightly flattening the emotional resonance of the climax. The internal conflict is articulated clearly, though occasionally it feels more intellectualized than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory metaphor, grounding her deafness in tactile experience rather than deficit. Her motivation is clear and poignant, though her agency in the central climax is somewhat passive; she provides the tools, but Risto performs the transformative ritual. The shift from numbness to feeling feels earned by her willingness to engage rather than a hard decisional trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator is distinct, but the interaction with the follower lacks genuine emotional friction; the transition from wariness to alliance is abrupt and convenient. Dialogue feels unnatural and declarative ("my work had always been for the unowned"), serving thematic exposition rather than character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator's internal conflict—restraint versus the need to grieve—is palpable and drives the central choice. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("mnemonic, precise, and real") rather than purely embodied experience, which distances the reader slightly at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's "ethical playfulness" effectively functions as a tactical engine, driving the resolution beyond a simple binary choice. Interiority is distinct and embodied ("pockets of ash"), though the escapee functions more as a thematic mirror than a fully realized counter-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara functions more as an archetypal healer than a conflicted protagonist. Her motivation ("find beauty in the unfinished") is stated as a philosophy rather than dramatized through difficult micro-choices or trade-offs. The lack of internal friction or contradictory impulses makes her feel static despite her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—fusing insight with empathy without drowning—creates a distinct, compelling interiority. The dynamic of "selling adoption papers, not offspring" establishes a unique, emotionally resonant constraint that shapes every interaction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    Characterization relies on idealized archetypes (the soulful broker, the whimsical librarian) devoid of internal contradiction or flaws. The protagonist’s "shrewd" nature is asserted via job title but contradicted by a uniformly poetic voice and a lack of difficult, calculative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Motivation is explicitly stated ("graft myself onto community") rather than dramatized through friction or contradiction. The protagonist's "fear" is mentioned but never felt, as they meet no resistance; they function more as a vessel for the ritual than a complex character making hard choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s specific internal landscape—balancing the illustrator’s observational discipline with the reckless curiosity of a creator—is compelling. The cost of the magic (future clumsiness) is a brilliant, character-specific detail that grounds the supernatural in a lived reality. The final choice to release the echo, prioritizing the creature's nature over possession, earns the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rich and consistent, effectively blending the analytical with the mystical. The motivation—grief driven by "ambiguous loss"—is clear, though the character functions somewhat as a vessel for the central conceit rather than a fully fleshed individual making difficult trade-offs. The interaction with the apprentice offers a tender, albeit ethereal, glimpse into a relationship that defines the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal logic is meticulously rendered, with the "visibility" motive driving a high-stakes choice to shed safety at the climax. The transition from observer to participant is earned through specific actions (repairing the tape) and culminates in a decisive physical revelation that carries unmistakable cost to their anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's internal arc from rigid controller to steward is compelling and clearly charted through the "itch" of certainty and the eventual "prayer" of the plan. Theo serves as an effective, if slightly functional, foil who prompts the protagonist's introspection without overshadowing the central consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The insomniac painter's motivation ("thresh meaning") drives the narrative efficiently, and the internal voice is consistent. However, the trait "wryly earnest" is told rather than dramatized, and the character faces little internal contradiction or agonizing choice, resulting in a functional but linear arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrator's specific ironic stance ("clairvoyant who didn't see it coming") provides a distinct filter for the events, elevating a standard guide role. While the protagonist functions primarily as a facilitator rather than a driver of deep conflict, the voice is consistent, and the "uncertainty" in the climax serves as a sufficient internal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator is a consistent, cohesive archetype ("Archivist") with a distinct worldview. However, they function more as a thematic vessel than a character with deeper agency or internal friction; their choices feel inevitable rather than conflicted, lacking an on-page struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's specific regrets (the father's apology, the lover, the sold half-maps) successfully anchor the surreal premise in human cost. However, the emotional interiority leans toward performative phrasing ("shivered with a trembling certainty") rather than embodied reaction until the confession sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lio's internal conflict regarding his sister's memory is poignant and drives the scene's emotional stakes. However, the narrator's "skeptic" label feels contradictory and told-only, as they actively initiate and competently perform a high-fantasy magical ritual without on-page hesitation or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's motivation—escaping the stagnation of immortality via a "spatial mutiny"—is compelling and informs every tactical choice. The shift from philosophical boredom to the sharp, cruel agency of the betrayal is effectively dramatized, with the cost of the transaction clearly displaced onto Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.5)
    The protagonist's defining paradox—the honest child of a con artist—is not just a trait but the engine of the climax. The decision to use "habit" to disguise the truth as work ("Even liars rely on habit... I let habit speak") is a brilliant, character-specific resolution to the central threat. Internal conflict is low, but the integration of identity into agency is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator is distinct but static; they begin and end in the same emotional posture of earnest stewardship. Motivation is stated ("simple and difficult") rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or high-stakes interactions. Without a second character or a harder external obstacle, the interiority feels somewhat insulated and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, and the status as a "death certificate error survivor" consistently drives the worldview and lifestyle choices. While the motivation is somewhat abstract ("discover the texture of memories"), it is pursued with concrete actions (collecting, pinning the label). The emotional embodiment is occasionally distant, filtered through heavy lyricism rather than visceral reaction, but the voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's "myth buster" persona provides a distinct worldview that colors the narration effectively. The pivot to the personal backstory (the kitchen table memory) is anchored well by the "compass" mechanism, though the emotional weight of that relationship relies heavily on a brief, late flashback. The internal conflict between professional detachment and personal regret is resolved with a clear, earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions as a competent mediator but lacks deep interiority or vulnerability; the internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is resolved too neatly with a "braid" metaphor rather than a choice that carries lasting personal cost. The character feels more like a plot device than a living person navigating genuine social friction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist’s motivation to preserve the "unbranded dawn" is poignant and clear. However, the attribute "purposefully curious" is integrated via direct labeling ("my purposefully curious heart") rather than demonstrated action, feeling slightly like an inserted prompt check. The mentor relationship adds depth, though the mentor himself remains a standard archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara functions as an idealized archetype of competence rather than a conflicted individual; she faces no internal opposition and pays no personal price for her success. The lack of flaws or contradictory impulses flattens the character into a vehicle for the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator is a compelling vessel for the story's atmospheric observations, but the specific trait of "dry wit" is claimed rather than demonstrated; the voice is uniformly solemn and lyrical. While the internal motivation is strong, the emotional cost of the journey remains abstract ("sound mad") rather than felt on the page. The character functions more as an archetype of the mystic cartographer than a fully realized individual with contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characters function as allegorical devices rather than people; the narrator is a passive witness, and the tuner is a flawless guide figure. There is no internal contradiction, "crucible" of relationship, or costly choice to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's motivation ("harness the ephemeral") is abstract but grounded effectively by the mother's backstory and the specific mission. The final choice to "turn down my oxygen" acts as a powerful, earned renunciation of survival in favor of the signal, demonstrating character through high-cost action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s burden—his father’s "cry wolf" legacy—is dramatized with distinct interiority, driving a compelling emotional arc. The choice to reject "alarms" for "work" is a well-earned renunciation that defines the character.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and consistent, grounding the fantastical elements in a palpable sense of duty and loss. While the protagonist's agency is somewhat reactive—following the ghost's instructions to resolve the plot—the emotional logic of the debt and the final acceptance of eternal service feels earned and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator is a consistent, archetypal presence fitting the "poetic weaver" persona, but interiority relies on stated traits ("I am hauntingly optimistic") rather than dramatized struggle. The lack of internal contradiction or high-stakes micro-choices leaves the character feeling more like a vessel for the prose than a living agent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; motivation is stated via abstract labels (&quot;restore lost faith&quot;) rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. Internal states are summarized in poetic shorthand (&quot;questions like water carried light&quot;) rather than embodied in difficult, high-stakes choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and distinct, grounding the "carefully inventive" persona in specific actions like reading chalk codes. The interaction with Mira reveals character through the trade of "three things," a strong show-don't-tell mechanic for establishing intimacy and stakes. The mentor (Oona) provides necessary context but feels slightly like a convenient shorthand for competence. The emotional logic holds, though the final hesitation implies a shift in confidence that isn't fully telegraphed.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Tamsin is a beautifully realized focalizer whose internal competence sharply contrasts with her external "fool" persona, driving agency. Her choice to intervene moves beyond observation to tangible action, creating a satisfying arc of defied expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal arc—from the "slam" of avoidance to the quiet endurance of staying—is rendered with precision and depth. The brother, though mostly a memory, exerts palpable pressure through "quiet eyes," creating a crucible for the protagonist's change.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator is compellingly competent, with weariness and expertise that anchor the scene's emotional logic. Motivation is clearly dramatized through the act of decoding, though the "lotus-hearted" internal label feels slightly precious compared to the grit of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for imagery rather than a conflicting psyche; the choice to "fix nothing" feels dictated by the grandmother's ghost rather than earned through internal struggle or contradictory impulses. The character lacks a distinct interiority beyond the lyrical observations.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator is competent and distinct, with a clear professional philosophy. However, the emotional landscape is relatively static; the "versions of me" sequence feels more like a scenic effect than a dramatized psychological struggle, limiting character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator and Ilya are stylistically distinct and consistent, but they function more as archetypes than fully embodied characters. The narrator lacks the required internal conflict or contradictory impulses; they are a steadfast witness without a moment of doubt or competing value to deepen the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is defined by lyrical labels ("insomniac poet") rather than dramatized psychology or difficult choices. The motivation is stated explicitly in exposition ("to photosynthesize pain") rather than revealed through action, and the "insomnia" acts as a trait without exacting a visible toll on the negotiation tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The caretaker's conflict between her systematic nature and the chaotic needs of the "deserted marvels" is resolved through a meaningful choice to use the cracked chime. Her motivation is palpable, though the central emotion ("foxglove regret") feels slightly stylized rather than fully embodied until the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation is clear (restoring trust), but the reconciliation feels frictionless; the characters heal a deep betrayal through a smooth ritual without interpersonal friction. The heavy metaphorical filtering distances the reader from the raw emotion of the "contrite friend."

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is distinct and competent but lacks an internal crucible; the "tremble" is immediately steadied, and the solution comes from external instructions (the letter) rather than a high-stakes personal choice. The character functions as a flawless fixer who encounters no genuine risk of failure or blinding flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s motivation—balancing a desire for safety with the “ache” of lost connection—is compelling and clearly anchors the decision to help Ezra. The shared ghost of “numbers” and tracking creates a distinct, believable bond between the characters without over-explaining. However, the shift from reluctance to acceptance relies heavily on the ritual of the scale rather than a sharp, dramatized interpersonal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal arc from abandonment to understanding is handled with maturity and specific emotional logic. The "stubborn with love" characterization effectively grounds the intellectual puzzle-solving in genuine feeling, and the realization at the cedar frame earns the shift in perspective without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.3)
    The characters function as interchangeable vessels for the story’s lyrical voice rather than distinct individuals. Motivation is explicitly stated ("learn the rhythm of belonging") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or costly choices. There is no genuine interpersonal friction or status dynamic between the narrator and Mara; their interaction is perfectly cooperative and lacks the pressure required to reveal character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist functions as a poetic observer rather than a character under pressure; motivation is stated ("discover why") but lacks dramatized urgency or resistance. The emotional landscape is described via metaphor ("smile shadowed") rather than embodied action, distancing the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's "analytical" nature is effectively dramatized through specific perceptions ("drifting tuples," "inventory of variables") rather than just labels. His internal motivation is clear and consistent, driving the action without deviation. However, the character lacks significant internal contradiction or high-stakes vulnerability; his control over the scene is nearly absolute, which limits the depth of the dramatic crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist’s internal motivation is lyrical and clear, but the antagonist’s conversion is too rapid and convenient to feel fully earned. The "friend once" backstory serves as a shortcut to resolve the conflict, bypassing the necessary pressure of a true standoff. The clerk's shift from threat to accomplice lacks sufficient emotional friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist is an aesthetic archetype rather than a psychological entity; they lack internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The motivation is stated abstractly ("to illuminate value") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and the net mender serves as a convenient prop rather than a character.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with "bargained innocence" is compelling and grounded, but Mira functions largely as a "magical wise stranger" rather than a fully realized character. The dialogue feels staged and overly poetic, with both characters speaking in high-concept metaphors that erode individual voice distinctiveness. Emotional beats are articulated through abstract labels ("hard softness") rather than purely embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a lyrical device for the premise rather than a person under pressure. While the late admission of fear adds a necessary dimension, the emotional arc is largely summarized, and the "lucid dreamer" persona keeps the stakes intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the shift from "burden" to "mercy" drives a clear agency-filled choice at the climax (recharting the echo). The motivation is established early and paid off, though the character functions somewhat as a vessel for the lyrical aesthetic rather than a gritty, lived-in individual.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The painter serves as a functional fable archetype, and Lio provides a necessary emotional anchor, but the characters lack the deep, contradictory internal impulses required for higher bands. The &quot;borrowed heartbeat&quot; suggests internal conflict (duty to self vs. city) but remains largely symbolic rather than driving a difficult choice between mutually exclusive options.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s internal conflict—guilt over a past "greenlit" ambush versus the duty to forge peace—is masterfully externalized in the ritual. The final choice to offer their own voice as collateral ("breath as bond") is a high-stakes, character-defining moment that feels earned by the preceding introspection. The "forever war" weariness is palpable and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s voice perfectly synthesizes the required "amoral philanthropist" persona with the "secretly sentimental" internal drive. The conflict between these two poles is not just stated but dramatized in the final choice: a calculated compromise that preserves the bird but refuses the "drastic thing" (fixing the drought). The decision feels inextricably linked to this specific character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira is a compelling archetype with clear agency; her choice to "unmake the story" drives the narrative. However, her interiority feels somewhat stylized and abstract ("blade of absence," "metronome"), prioritizing poetic function over embodied, messy human contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Aurel's internal landscape is rich ("hive of second thoughts"), but the reconciliation with Ferro and Miri lacks interpersonal friction; their immediate compliance lowers the scene's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist is clearly defined by the "esoteric realist" philosophy, which drives the ritualistic action and specific worldview. The connection to the grandmother ("raised by workers") grounds the high-concept motivation in personal history, though the internal conflict is subtle, relying more on devotion than contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is distinct and the artisan persona is well-rendered, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the internal conflict is largely resolved in the first sentence ("had finally forgiven myself"), removing active struggle from the scene; the protagonist performs the ritual without significant psychological resistance or error.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a lyrical vessel for the theme than a fleshed-out agent with contradictory desires or grounded limitations. While the voice is consistent, the motivation is abstract ("discover why some paths choose their walkers"), and the character's internal life consists largely of poetic observation rather than the friction of genuine decision-making. The "ache" of the name "Only" is mentioned but never dramatized or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's frugality serves as a unified worldview that dictates both his magic system and his "empirically ironic" faith. The internal resolution—surrendering ego to become a "method"—is a profound, character-specific cost that earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voices are distinct and the internal landscape of the narrator ("pockets full of methods and heartaches") is compelling. Mara's transition from guarded general to vulnerable participant feels emotionally grounded, though the resistance dissolves somewhat too easily for the weight of "grief [that] kept two cities in siege." The "scheming" aspect is well-dramatized through the narrator's calculated use of the music box.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.3)
    Iren is a functional archetype for a fable, possessing a clear goal and consistent demeanor. However, he lacks the internal contradiction or visceral, embodied emotion required for higher bands; his grief is treated as backstory exposition rather than a live pressure that complicates his choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, grounded in a specific worldview ("quartz-eye mender") that colors every observation. The sacrifice of the daughter's ribbon is a decisive micro-choice that demonstrates internal cost and shifting priorities without melodrama. The "deciduous vows" concept feels integrated into the character's psychology rather than just a plot point.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist demonstrates clear agency by repurposing the cameo, prioritizing attention over ego. This choice forecloses the "future face" inheritance, satisfying the cost requirement. The "bathroom breakthrough" quirk serves as a functional, if slightly convenient, character trait that structures the decision process.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—weighing the duty of the rescue against the selfish desire to leave a burden—creates a compelling, character-defining arc. The voice is distinct and authoritative, though the explicit self-labeling ("I am carefully resourceful") is a minor intrusion of "telling" in an otherwise well-dramatized performance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal division—manifested as the chimera twin—is dramatized effectively through the mirror scene and the garden climax. The collaboration with the externalized twin provides a specific, embodied resolution to the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator is competent and consistent but lacks the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands. Characterization relies on self-applied labels ("warmly methodical," "adaptable") rather than dramatized emotional friction. The protagonist faces the central problem without doubt or personal cost, resulting in a static arc.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Mapkeeper is a competent professional whose internal state mirrors the environment too perfectly, lacking significant internal contradiction or conflicting impulses. While the expertise is convincing, the lack of a difficult trade-off limits emotional depth; the final decision to "be found" feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kera is a compelling focalizer whose competence is balanced by a distinct emotional void ("gap she could not bear"). Her specific ability ("retrocognitively blessed") is dramatized through sensory action rather than just labeled, and her choice to "invite the silences to teach" feels earned by her characterization as a listener to the pavilion's music.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator's interiority relies on abstract labels ("earliest fear," "latest joy") rather than concrete particulars, rendering the emotional climax theoretical rather than visceral. While the "furniture" metaphor effectively outlines the internal conflict, the lack of specific memory content makes the resolution feel performative.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lio serves as a functional archetype (the healing artist) whose "tender ache" is labeled rather than embodied. His motivation is stated overtly in exposition rather than dramatized through costly, high-stakes choices or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's "chronicler" persona effectively shapes the internal monologue and the pivotal choice to offer a "catalog" instead of a binary answer. However, the emotional experience is often filtered through heavy abstraction, making the characters feel like vessels for poetic wisdom rather than embodied people in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal arc—from enduring the father's memory as trauma to recontextualizing it as "gilded" protection—is profound and earned via sensory engagement. The "bunker builder's child" identity isn't just a label but the engine of the central conflict, driving the need to hunt silences and ultimately determining the nature of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is characterized with distinct professional competence and a specific, empathetic worldview ("more listening than steering"). The internal motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" drives every on-page choice, particularly the gentle handling of the child's grief. The "fluidly logical" trait feels slightly more asserted than demonstrated, but the operator's actions remain consistent and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maris is a distinct, voice-driven protagonist with a clear role and motivation grounded in heritage. While her competence is satisfying, the internal conflict remains mild; the choice to accept stewardship feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, lacking a moment of severe doubt or contradictory impulse that would heighten the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrator functions as a symbolic archetype (the Healer/Teacher) rather than a contradictory human consciousness. While the internal logic is consistent, the lack of conflicting impulses or genuine flaws creates a static "wise guide" persona that faces no internal crucible. The visitor is similarly reduced to a function of their need, lacking distinct interiority beyond the "suffocating" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, and the backstory of the "pyramid scheme survivor" effectively shapes their worldview and motivation. However, the motivation ("translate pressure into diamonds") is abstract and conveyed primarily through internal monologue rather than dramatized struggle. The choice to volunteer feels sudden, driven by the prompt's requirements rather than a deepening of the character's immediate on-page desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's internal state is vivid, and the shift from "dynasty ender" to "listener" provides a clear conceptual repricing. However, agency is somewhat dampened by the passivity of the central action ("my hands obeyed"), reducing the friction of the choice until the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a specific individual; his interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("old wars," "kingdom of halted clocks") rather than grounded memory or visceral reaction. While the transition from warrior to gardener is clear, it lacks internal friction; he sheds his identity with ease, missing the opportunity for a conflicted, earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and consistent, with the "broken-hearted" persona effectively driving the urge to repair history through the archive. The internal conflict between bureaucratic protocol ("rulebook says I preserve") and human empathy ("policy says personal property belongs to youth") is well-dramatized in the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Jessa is a competent archetype rather than a specific individual; her "underestimated" nature is asserted but not dramatized through status dynamics or contrast. She lacks internal contradiction or a meaningful flaw; her choices are tactical rather than moral or emotional, leaving the character feeling like a vehicle for the plot rather than a living person paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist is characterized through deep competence and a lyrical internal monologue that reveals a specific history of "harder reverence." While the internal conflict is largely retrospective (past desire for applause vs. present duty), the "vested hush" operates as a compelling embodiment of character discipline. The emotional cost—anonymity and the burden of silence—is palpable and shapes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fen’s internal landscape is rich ("careful barns of feeling"), and his motivation is clear. The pivot from a lifetime of hoarding to releasing is a strong Decisive Change with visible cost, though the internal resistance to destroying his life's work folds slightly too quickly given his established nature.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist feels more like a vessel for the theme than a conflicted individual. The motivation ("promised to learn to befriend uncertainty") is declared in summary rather than dramatized through struggle or resistance, making the character's compliance with the adventure feel inevitable and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrator's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("Precision is my romance," "balance is a jealous arithmetic") rather than embodied emotion. While the final choice to offer truth over comfort is character-specific, the voice feels more like a vessel for philosophical aphorisms than a living person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape—defined by the guilt of the drowning man—is revealed effectively through action and the climactic confession. The motivation is clear and drives the plot, though the explicit statement of intent ("I told the laugh my reason") feels slightly didactic compared to the subtlety of the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s psychology is exceptionally realized; the interplay between "enhanced" mechanical perception and raw trauma creates a distinct internal conflict. The choice to treat memory as an archive of spasms and the final decision to relinquish control (leaving the strap) demonstrate deep agency and earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions effectively as a specialized observer, consistent with the &quot;translator&quot; role, but lacks internal friction or distinct flaws. The interaction with the elder is frictionless, reading more as a ritual enactment than a dramatic encounter with human texture. Motivation is stated explicitly rather than emerging from a struggle between competing desires.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist has a distinct, specialized perspective ("loads and escapes"), and agency drives the resolution. However, the emotional cost is minimal; the narrator resolves the ghosts' burden easily without significant personal struggle or risk, leaving the internal arc feeling slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's motivation is beautifully grounded in specific backstory ("measuring time as a line instead of a fold"), elevating abstract desire into concrete need. The pivotal micro-choice to "loosen the press beyond regulation" perfectly demonstrates character priorities overriding safety systems with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Neris’s "defunct" status actively informs the "kneeling" tactic, efficiently integrating backstory into immediate strategy. The internal shift from resignation to considering revolt provides a complete, subtle arc that earns the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is drawn with distinct, constrained traits ("wilts near dishonesty") that function as physiological limits, forcing specific tactical choices during the confrontation with the constable. The motivation is clear and consistent with the fable archetype, and the choice to defy the elders' truce drives the narrative efficiently. The internal reaction to the constable's smile—knees softening due to its dishonesty—is a brilliant integration of character trait into action.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is a coherent observer but lacks internal conflict or genuine risk; they function as a vessel for the prose rather than a living agent. The trait "sensibly eccentric" is asserted via exposition ("which means I test, not leap") rather than emerging organically from difficult choices. While the "psychometry" provides a connection to the explorers, the protagonist pays no personal price for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist functions more as a lyrical vessel than a person under pressure; the internal monologue relies on diagnostic telling ("Perpetually learning was her creed") rather than dramatized struggle. The transition from danger to "turbine-hum reverie" lacks visceral emotional cost, as competence is asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions as a passive vessel for observation rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. The transition from "vivid" to "quiet" artist happens without dramatized struggle or cost, and the motivation remains abstract and philosophical throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s motivation—to preserve a difficult truth rather than a sanitized history—is clear and drives the conflict with Esteban effectively. The interaction reveals character through choice (accepting the promise), though Esteban's dialogue occasionally mirrors the narrator's elevated lyrical voice ("breathing the lagoon backwards") rather than possessing a distinct idiom, which slightly flattens the character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is inextricably linked to his external actions; his refusal of "false comfort" is dramatized through the physical labor of the cairns and the projection. The shift from solitary discipline to collective "first citizen" is earned by his persistence, creating a resonant arc of leadership through service.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict between the scribal duty to bind and the prophetic reality of the "split" is compelling and distinct. The final choice to witness rather than seal is a decisive character beat that earns the shift in identity with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is competent and the motivation is clear, but the emotional arc lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The character functions largely as a vehicle for the ritual, with the connection to the grandmother providing context rather than dramatic pressure or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency and distinct interiority, with expertise grounded in specific action. While the self-application of "humble" feels slightly declarative, the internal conflict between duty and preservation is dramatized effectively through the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator is distinct, but the internal landscape relies on diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "grief I could not lift") rather than embodied action. The salvage crew functions as props rather than characters, converting instantly from antagonists to allies without credible psychological resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara acts as a competent vessel for the story's ritual rather than a character with internal friction or contradiction. She succeeds at every step without struggle; her "tranquilly perceptive" nature insulates her from difficulty rather than generating drama. Her motivation is abstract and philosophical, lacking a visceral, embodied cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions more as a lyrical observer than an agent of difficult choice; while the motivation to "understand texture" is consistent, it remains abstract. The internal landscape is uniform, lacking the contradictory impulses or grit that create deep characterization. The surrender at the end ("let the borrowed coins tremble free") feels like a poetic inevitability rather than a hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrator functions as a "magical sage" device rather than a character, delivering prepared wisdom to archetypal supporting figures. Dialogue is visibly artificial and didactic ("admit the wind's mischief"), breaking naturalism to serve the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist is vividly drawn as a stoic sage, but his "brazen calm" and near-perfect competence reduce the sense of struggle or risk. While the internal landscape of facing mortality is rich, the character functions more as an archetype of wisdom than a flawed individual navigating a crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "skeptic" label is asserted but not dramatized; the narrator accepts the alien "magic" (dust resisting rain, inhaling libraries) without the resistance or testing that the trait implies.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator is a compelling, mythic presence with a highly distinct voice, serving as a stable anchor for the fable. However, the character lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; they function as a competent, unwavering vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted protagonist. The "coachman" persona is consistent, but the emotional cost is observed rather than struggled through internally.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation (longing) is clear, and Gable functions well as a companion who prompts a key action. However, the narrative lacks internal conflict or a high-stakes dilemma; the protagonist solves the riddle without facing a difficult choice or paying a felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, balancing the intellectual obsession of the scientist with the emotional weight of being a "blessed pariah." The choice to stay is justified by a distinct worldview ("turn confusion into exploration"), and the final realignment feels like an earned expression of character rather than just a plot mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kestrel is a distinct, vivid focal point with a specific backstory (compass maker betrayal) that informs his actions. The narrator serves as a functional vessel for the "wonder" arc, though their transition from fear to courage is somewhat linear. The relationship balances mentor/apprentice dynamics well without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal arc from performative trauma ("pretending to bleed") to authentic witness is compelling and tightly woven into the action. The choice to unbind the cord and accept the "sentence" of memory demonstrates agency and earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist’s motivation to redefine "home" is clear and drives the narrative, but the emotional landscape relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("smothered with busyness") rather than visceral, embodied experience. While the internal shift—from seeking a place to claiming a practice—is distinct, the character functions more as a vessel for the lyrical imagery than a fully fleshed presence. The transaction with the Seer effectively dramatizes the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal arc—from a guilt-ridden strategist to a healer—is perfectly mapped onto the external action. The conflict is embodied in specific physical cues (the fidgeting, the knot-tying), and the decision to "draw the game" rather than win is a profound, earned character turn.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's defiance is clear and motivates the plot, but the internal arc is static; they begin and end with the same certainty. The "innocently mischievous" trait is claimed via narration rather than dramatized through on-page choices that create friction or cost. The elders function as straw men rather than distinct characters, limiting the complexity of the status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist’s arc from reliance on the teacher’s memory to independent action is clearly realized through the sacrifice of the charm. However, the label "uncertain" is told more than shown, as his technical competence in reading the statue contradicts his supposed hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, balancing the "intimately aloof" persona with genuine vulnerability ("hands shook"). The motivation (a deadline driven by the broken mirror) is compelling and idiosyncratic. A slight reliance on label-like self-definition ("I preferred intimately aloof") prevents a higher score, though the character consistently embodies this trait through action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal logic is consistent and distinct, grounding the fable-like "whisper" method in specific history and discipline. The dynamic with Alder provides necessary friction, revealing character through the contrast of "shouting" versus "cradling," though the protagonist's unwavering certainty slightly flattens the internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's interiority is rich and distinct, successfully grounding the high-concept role in the physical labor of the signal station. The relationship with Rowan provides a critical emotional anchor, turning abstract "loss" into a specific, felt connection that drives the scene's urgency. The choice to cannibalize the mother's censer for the counterweight demonstrates clear agency and character prioritization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator is distinct and introspective, with a clear internal struggle between the virus’s compulsion and the desire for safety. However, the voice conflicts with the self-description; the protagonist claims to be "rational" and suspicious of charms, yet narrates in lush, heavy metaphors ("tide chart drawn by a poet," "rational as rainfall").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator's voice ("Old Partial") is distinct and consistent, effectively anchoring the fable-like tone. However, the protagonist's competence is undermined by the abstract leap of logic used to deduce the name "Mira" from missing freighter whistles, which feels like authorial insertion rather than character-driven problem solving.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias is a distinct presence with a clear backstory and motivation. However, the emotional pivot at the climax—where his "empirically intuitive mind named [loneliness] an error"—feels rushed and diagnostic rather than visibly struggled with in the moment. The transformation relies on summary ("named it an error") rather than a dramatized emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The queen demonstrates clear agency and a decisive internal shift ("unmake my unmaking"), driving the narrative. However, her interiority is often mediated through heavy metaphor ("lace tightened," "vows stirring like moths") rather than embodied sensation, creating a slight emotional distance that prevents deeper visceral connection.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrator's motivation is abstract, grounded in high-concept magic rather than visceral need. The relationship with Lio is warm but lacks friction; the climactic &quot;secret&quot; is withheld from the reader, described only as &quot;heavy,&quot; which hollows out the emotional payoff and prevents genuine intimacy with the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator is a distinct, lyrical presence whose internal landscape effectively mirrors the external setting. The "past selves" (surveyor, lover, child) are sketched with remarkable economy, serving as distinct active forces that drive the climax rather than mere furniture. While the "jealousy" motivation is slightly abstract until the dream sequence, the interrogation of these selves provides a satisfying, character-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a clear sensory worldview shaped by the loss of smell. However, the resulting ability to "map emotional terrain" feels slightly romanticized and convenient rather than a source of struggle or blind spots. The character lacks internal friction; their empathy is perfect and immediate, which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape—fear of failure mapped onto physical scars—is effectively externalized through the ritual task. The shift from rigid perfectionism to relational "bridging" is earned through the specific struggle with the frost, creating a cohesive emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is sharply defined through a unique vocational lens ("gossip-column exorcist") that creates immediate internal conflict. The arc from exploiter to penitent witness is executed efficiently, with the "overdue apology" driving every beat. Mara serves as a grounded counterweight, and their shared history adds palpable weight to the ritual without needing excessive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is an effective archetype for this mythic mode, with motivation clearly dramatized through the ritual. However, interiority remains stylized and distant; the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a person with embodied, contradictory emotions or specific psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator is distinct, with a voice perfectly suited to the specialized role of a "clock shepherd." The internal conflict—managing the "panic" of the drift through ritual—is well-rendered. However, the emotional stakes regarding "funding and men" feel like abstract window dressing compared to the strong metaphysical internal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voices converge significantly; Ren and Mira speak in the narrator's specific lyrical idiom ("quiet wildfire traveling under frost") rather than distinct character voices. The protagonist's connection to Ren relies on asserted history ("subway reflection") rather than dramatized interaction in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between probability and "luck management" is drawn with sharp, specific interiority. The father is vividly realized through gesture ("scratched metronome"), though the protagonist's "theoretical rebelliousness" feels slightly more like a stated label than a dramatized trait in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions more as a magical narrative device than a person under pressure; while the voice is consistent, the character lacks contradictory impulses or active struggle in the present scene. The "orphan" conflict is resolved through established competence rather than a new, difficult choice, leaving the internal landscape static.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's motivation—balancing grief with the duty of the "regenerated covenant"—is compelling and creates a strong internal anchor. The emotional landscape is vivid, though the explicit labeling of feelings ("exact flavor of duty") occasionally substitutes for dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mara functions as a hyper-competent archetype rather than a fully realized character; her traits are established through labels ("elusive," "desperately jocular") rather than enacted choices under pressure. Motivation is stated abstractly ("plain and private") and she faces no internal contradiction or significant failure that would humanize her success.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's interiority is rich and sensory, fitting the premise perfectly. However, the character is extremely stable ("steady as banked coals") from the start, navigating the crisis with high competence and minimal internal hesitation, which lowers dramatic tension in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s internal struggle between the urge to erase and the wisdom to "accompany" is beautifully dramatized. The motivation is explicit ("thresh meaning"), which slightly flattens the subtext, but the specific action of unbending the pen embodies the trait perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrator functions as a passive observer rather than an active agent, with motivation stated in abstract themes rather than embodied drive. The advisor is a "magical guide" archetype whose charisma is labeled rather than dramatized through complex interaction. The emotional arc relies on declared feelings ("joyful sorrow") rather than earned internal shifts or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s paradoxical nature—an arsonist preserving stories—drives a compelling internal conflict that resolves meaningfully in the "Ember Lending" project. Motivation is clear and distinct, though the character's voice occasionally intellectualizes emotion into abstraction ("desire computes trajectories"), distancing the reader from the felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency through the specific "drumming" method, defying the passive role of a "guinea pig." The internal conflict between the desire to save Jonah and the acceptance of the "blur" as a cost is compelling and well-dramatized. The trait "quietly rebellious" is explicitly stated twice, which feels slightly mechanical, but it successfully drives the decision to ignore the "muzzle of reassurance."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist is highly competent, with a distinct worldview ("maintenance secrets are not locks") that shapes every action. While the internal motivation is clear and drives the plot, the character lacks significant internal conflict or contradictory impulses during the crisis, reading more as a master at work than a character under pressure of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is defined by a compelling, distinct constraints-based persona ("silent canal guardian") that drives every interaction. The vow of silence is not merely a quirk but a functional tool that shapes the rescue, creating a unique form of agency. The interplay between the guardian's internal discipline ("work is simple to say and difficult to practice") and the external crisis is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrator functions more as a sage-like device than a conflicted character, with the "hearing thoughts" attribute providing a convenient omniscience that removes interpersonal friction. The "kids" operate as a choral monolith without individual agency or distinct personalities, reducing the cast to props for the protagonist's vision. Internal conflict is absent; the narrator is certain of the method and moral standing from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic self-labeling ("I am a graceful dock worker," "stubborn one") rather than demonstrated character traits. The central motivation is delivered via an explicit thesis statement ("I want to find freedom in embracing one's true nature") rather than dramatized desire. The pirate acts as a convenient exposition delivery system rather than a distinct character exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is beautifully specific: cultivating lightness to tend a void. The internal contradiction between the performed "blankness" and the deep grief for Lei drives every micro-choice, transforming the "blank-faced" archetype into a complex survivor. The backstory of the farmer and widow efficiently establishes his moral complexity without stalling the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist is an idealized archetype lacking internal contradiction, struggle, or vulnerability; he functions as a flawless vehicle for the theme rather than a person making difficult choices. His success is immediate and inevitable, as his specific method meets no friction from his own limitations or doubts.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    Ilias functions as a static archetype rather than a fully realized character; he arrives wise and succeeds without internal conflict or psychological cost. His "flaw" of colorblindness serves only as a thematic asset, never generating the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's internal voice is distinct, blending technical expertise with lyric interiority to create a compelling persona. While the self-description of being "powerfully gentle" feels slightly curated, the interaction with the child grounds the character's wisdom in a concrete, earned moment of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's craft acts as a strong lens for their worldview, grounding abstract grief in the specific "grammar of lungs" and "micromesh." However, the "rock bottom" state is reported as backstory rather than dramatized as active pressure, making the character feel more like a settled guide than a protagonist navigating live struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist and cartomancer serve as thematic vessels rather than individuated characters, lacking internal contradiction or distinct emotional embodiment beyond a generalized "confusion." The interaction is frictionless and cooperative, devoid of the interpersonal stakes or status dynamics that would drive a deeper scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist is sharply defined, with professional competence ("trained for silence") conflicting meaningfully with human impulse ("urge to keep this"). The choice to betray her guild's secrecy for the city's sake is a high-cost decision earned by the narrative arc. The internal struggle is embodied, not just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator is a competent, coherent focalizer who performs their role with grace. However, the character feels somewhat static; they possess total mastery over the situation, facing no internal contradiction or hesitation, which limits the depth of the dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between compassion and professional integrity is well-dramatized, culminating in a clear, high-stakes choice to offer a path to repair. The motivation is explicit and drives the action, though the internal state is sometimes rendered through dense metaphor rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's internal conflict—seeking closure versus the compulsion to open wounds—is articulated with precision and resolves in a distinct shift of stance (Earned Stasis). The motivation to "read the stories in scars" drives every choice, transforming the prompt's requirements into a cohesive psychological arc.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is a competent functional expert ("more mapmaker than mystic") who performs a ritual with skill but lacks internal contradiction or vulnerability. While the voice is distinct, the character experiences no significant struggle or cost; they arrive, diagnose, and fix the problem without personal stakes or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype rather than a person, functioning as a competent magical operator without internal conflict or doubt. Motivation is clear but static; the character succeeds at every step without confronting a flaw or making a difficult trade-off that tests their values.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist serves as a distinct, mythic vessel for the premise. While psychological interiority is stylized, the central choice—renouncing sleep to maintain the archive's gift—is a clear moment of Earned Stasis that defines his agency and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's arc from seeking an external frontier to realizing they created the fences is conceptually strong. The internal struggle is effectively dramatized through the gear/tooth interaction, though the emotional landscape remains somewhat abstract ("clicks to grief") rather than visceral until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.3)
    The protagonist functions largely as a passive recipient of the guides' wisdom, following instructions without significant internal resistance or contradictory impulses. The motivation ("unused courage") remains abstract and is resolved through compliance rather than a dramatized struggle or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is vivid and physically grounded, blending physiological pain with thematic inquiry effectively. The protagonist’s motivation—to weigh the cost of safety against silence—drives the scene without expositional drift. The dynamic with the bellhop is subtle but potent, creating a shared intimacy of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lys is a compelling, distinct figure, and her competence drives the narrative effectively. However, the attribute "regally unpretentious" is applied as a static label to two different characters (Lys and the gardener), which feels mechanical and flattens the distinction between them. Emotional cost is minimal; she operates with mythic certainty rather than internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's identity as a "witness" is not merely a label but the engine of the story's methodology; the transition from counting absences in reefs to counting rhythms in the tide is psychologically astute and causally tight. Interiority is distinct, blending scientific discipline with personal grief, though the interaction with Jun serves more as a plot device than a crucible for character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist is a competent vessel for the narrative's lyricism but lacks internal contradiction or struggle; the "awkwardly confident" attribute is applied as a label rather than dramatized through mistakes or hesitation. The character succeeds without facing a difficult micro-choice that would reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara is a distinct, capable protagonist with a clear worldview ("insurgent grandmother"), but her interiority and dialogue often function as thematic mouthpieces rather than organic expression. Her interactions with the Council feel staged to deliver a manifesto rather than genuine conflict, reducing her dimension in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Samira is a distinct, grounded protagonist whose internal conflict (PTSD vs. presence) drives the narrative agency. Her choice to move the ceremony is motivated by a coherent worldview ("anchor optimism in realism"). While some emotional processing is slightly over-articulated via labels ("somatic markers"), the physical embodiment of her trauma remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's internal struggle is vivid, but the shift from portrait artist to lighthouse mechanic relies on convenience rather than established competence. The epiphany is earned conceptually, but the physical capability to repair the mechanism using tarot cards as a guide strains character consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's transformation from a seeker refusing a lie to a teacher confirming a hard truth is compelling. The specific "tracker" perception filters the world effectively, though the "albino" trait functions primarily as imagery rather than a plot constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal conflict is clear and motivates the central choice, but the antagonist (the shadow) acts as a prop who capitulates immediately, lowering the dramatic tension. Interiority is vivid but often abstracted through heavy metaphor rather than grounded in visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Characterization is distinct and purposeful; the narrator’s steadiness contrasts well with the father’s jagged trauma. The father’s transformation is earned through the shared crisis of the storm and the narrator's consistent modeling of values, though his internal pivot happens relatively quickly. The "senselessly perceptive" trait effectively bridges their perspectives at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is competent and distinct, fitting the mythic tone well, but functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character. While his motivation (the promise to the girl) is clear, his internal landscape is static ("cool-headed" throughout), and his hyper-competence lowers the sense of personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, blending her heritage ("newsprint heiress") with her current agency ("janitor" of truth) effectively. The internal motivation is clear and drives the action, though the characterization of Kline feels slightly thin, serving more as a foil for her wit than a fully resistant antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is inextricably linked to the central mechanic (translating/repairing sound), creating a unified arc where professional craft resolves personal grief. The internal conflict regarding the nephew's death drives every micro-choice, culminating in a self-determined salvation via the time loop. The realization that the protagonist is both savior and saved adds profound agency to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is highly competent but lacks internal conflict or genuine vulnerability. They function more as a magical device or therapist than a character under pressure; they know exactly what to do ("I said," "I touched") and face no significant opposition that tests their flaws. The trait "socially perceptive" is delivered via direct exposition ("I am socially perceptive") rather than emerging organically from a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is a "gentle radical" archetype who lacks genuine internal struggle; their "perfect emotional calibration" allows them to disarm the antagonist without doubt or error. The revelation of the "arms of steel" suggests an intriguing construct nature, but the character functions more as a thematic delivery system than a vulnerable entity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, combining spectral detachment with sensory urgency, and their motivation to prompt an "encore" of courage drives the narrative effectively. Rowan acts as a clear focal point for this pressure, though her internal shift relies heavily on the narrator's magical intervention rather than independent agency. The emotional logic holds, with the ghost's desire for repetition contrasting poignantly with the human need for progression.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist’s internal state—overwhelmed by sensory input yet eager to harness it—is portrayed with visceral specificity. Mara’s role as an anchor is effective, though her "affectionate skeptic" label feels slightly prescriptive rather than fully dramatized through friction; their alignment is perhaps too smooth, lacking the grit of harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is a consistent, functional vessel for the concept but lacks deep internal conflict or dramatized motivation. The drive "to become the voice of the unknown" is stated in exposition rather than revealed through a struggle between competing desires. While interiority is rich with sensory metaphor, the emotional landscape feels static, observing the world without being significantly tested by it.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions well as a fable archetype but lacks the internal friction or specific, high-stakes trade-offs required for higher bands. The primary action is ritualistic enactment rather than a choice made under duress; the character starts and ends with the same certainty, paying no personal price for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal state is well-rendered, with the "burned" status creating a credible constraint on their actions. The shift from caution to the risk of the "apology" code demonstrates clear agency and character change. Motivation is consistent, though the phrasing "unused courage" leans slightly into diagnostic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with the "palimpsest promise" is richly textured, and the trembling hands at the climax ground the emotion physically. However, the Coachman functions as a magical solvent, performing the pivotal action of unstitching the knot when the protagonist cannot, which slightly dilutes the protagonist's agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrator functions as a polished observer rather than a character under pressure; the "zen-minded" persona precludes genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The motivation—"questions nested under my ribcage"—is stated rather than dramatized through friction or difficulty. While the voice is consistent, the lack of a personal stake or possibility of failure keeps the character flat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist is distinct and motivated, but the characterization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I am wistfully pragmatic," "fits my protected vulnerability") rather than demonstrated traits. The lack of internal friction or hesitation during the heist makes the emotional arc feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist serves more as a thematic vessel than a living character; the motivation is abstractly stated as a thesis ("translate isolation into independence") rather than dramatized. Crucially, the emotional climax is resolved via a diagnostic label ("Tone: None") rather than embodied struggle, which distances the reader from the cost of the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist is an archetype of the "soulful artist" rather than a flawed individual; the reunion feels awarded for poetic competence rather than earned through difficult choices or sacrifice. Emotional interiority relies on abstract metaphors ("conjure constellations") rather than grounded, embodied feeling, keeping the character distinct but distant.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrator is competent and distinct, with a clear voice and motivation. However, the secondary characters (the team) function largely as props without internal life, and the antagonist (Provost) lacks psychological depth, pivoting instantly upon exposure to the device without genuine struggle or negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's motivation—retrieving the grandmother's key—is clear and drives the narrative, but the internal landscape feels slightly more aesthetic than psychological. The "claustrophobic" trait creates texture in the nave scene ("measured sips") but functions more as flavor than a constraint that forces a difficult tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lio’s prosopagnosia is a compelling hook that shapes his interaction with the world, but his introduction relies on a dry expository summary rather than active demonstration. The Captain’s shift from guarded rescuer to confessor is dramatic, though his psychological turning point feels slightly rushed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist demonstrates a compelling arc of agency, shifting from a desire for release to a sacrificial decision to honor her ancestor ("one more cycle"). While the self-definition ("idealistic map librarian") feels slightly like a label, the final choice to stay despite permission to leave serves as a strong, character-defining beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is passive, largely following the fiddler without generating resistance or making difficult choices. The motivation ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") is abstract and poetic rather than a grounded drive that forces a trade-off. Emotion is described via elaborate metaphors ("luminous disbelief") rather than embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's dual identity—highway robber's son and tech founder—creates a unique, embodied internal conflict that drives every micro-choice. The shift from "polishing calm" to accepting the "ghosts" is earned through the interaction with the neighborhood kid, demonstrating a clear change in worldview. The voice is distinct, merging corporate precision with outlaw fatalism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrator's profession ("lucid dream chronicler") acts as a label rather than a skill set that drives choices; they could be any observer with a notebook. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("bring language back to grief," "witnessing did not pin her to the past") instead of embodied emotion, and the characters' connection feels performed through metaphor rather than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary; Issa’s internal landscape ("room inside her armor") is rendered with specific, embodied detail that mirrors the external action. The conflict between her past complicity and her present duty drives a closure choice that feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist is defined by abstract labels ("purposefully curious") and metaphorical states rather than distinct psychology or micro-choices. The emotional arc is summarized ("anxious elation") rather than dramatized, and the interaction with the girl lacks the friction or status dynamics needed to make the connection feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation to save the brother is clear, and the choice to accept scars demonstrates agency and commitment. However, relying on direct self-diagnosis ("I am a reckless idealist") rather than dramatizing the trait weakens immersion. The internal conflict is somewhat muted by the character's competence, making the emotional journey feel smoother than the high stakes imply.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's synthesis of "ex-roadie" and "appraiser" creates a distinct, highly specific worldview where technical knowledge serves as emotional armor. The shift from shame-driven concealment to professional purpose is dramatized through engagement with the object, earning the internal reconfiguration. The "insulating emotionally" moment, while slightly diagnostic, is immediately grounded in specific technical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is vividly rendered through the specific lens of their profession. The central choice—renouncing the "mastery" of rescue to instead "listen"—is a decisive character beat that feels earned by the prior calibration of the ritual. The "kindly methodical" trait is successfully weaponized as a tool for survival and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The librarian is a compelling archetype with a distinct voice, but functions more as a magical device than a character under pressure. There is no internal contradiction or hesitation in the execution of duties; the "smelting of doubt" is narrated rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The emotional arc is static, resting on competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a mythic archetype than a grounded character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle. The "tug of old doctrine" is mentioned but instantly overcome, making the choice to break protocol feel weightless and inevitable rather than earned. While the voice is distinct, the emotional landscape is described through abstract metaphor ("grit of grief") rather than embodied reaction or genuine psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—between the romantic writer he was and the blunt chronicler he aims to be—is perfectly externalized through the physical maintenance of the culvert. The motivation is visceral, driven by the specific guilt of a fatal error ("mapped the flood wrong"), and the choice to "write a confession" in the atlas earns the redemption arc with visible social and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions effectively as an archetypal seeker in a fable, maintaining consistent motivation and successfully executing the prompt's tasks. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract; the "tremor of joy" and "cautious exuberance" are stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or specific emotional cost. The character lacks the distinct friction of flaws or personal stakes beyond the immediate puzzle, keeping the performance competent but distant.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s motivation is compelling, grounded in a professional ethical crisis that forces a personal sacrifice. The choice to destroy the artifact rather than preserve it is a decisive, character-defining act earned by the internal conflict. Interiority is vivid, though at times the emotional logic relies on poetic abstraction ("heart trained to pretend") rather than visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is achieved through precise, embodied action rather than exposition; the choice to use a brush made of the narrator's own hair is a visceral, specific detail that anchors the grief. The internal conflict—balancing professional detachment with personal loss—is dramatized effectively in the trembling hesitation before the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is clearly defined as a "kindly decisive" caretaker, but they function more as a static sage than a character under pressure. The wisdom is possessed from the start rather than earned through immediate struggle in the scene, which lowers the emotional stakes of the micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivations are sharply defined, with the narrator's professional empathy creating a distinct, non-stereotypical "guide" persona. Mara's internal conflict is externalized effectively through the props, and her shift from rigidity to "brave fear" is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrator is passive, serving primarily as a camera for the researcher's lesson without meaningful internal conflict or difficult choices. The researcher functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character, with emotions described generically ("smile wavered") rather than embodied in complex action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's motivation—navigating without moving—is distinct and drives every micro-choice, creating a strong sense of professional competence. The internal conflict is subtle but present in the urge to chase versus the discipline of stillness, which pays off in the final renunciation of movement. The grandmother's influence provides necessary depth, grounding the abstract magic in relational history.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's internal struggle between "marketable pattern" and authentic presence is beautifully dramatized. The decision to unstrap the harness is a profound, character-defining micro-choice that earns the resolution and demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator's internal landscape is vivid, but the central conflict—"hiding behind truth"—feels abstract and asserted rather than demonstrated through interaction. The foreman acts as a mouthpiece for this trait rather than a pressure point. The character functions more as a poetic vessel than a grounded protagonist with tangible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator's internal conflict—the tension between the duty to "keep the scatter honest" and the human "longing from steering"—is compelling and drives the ritual. The specific trait "quietly enthusiastic" is stated early but feels less dramatized in micro-choices than the pervasive "stellar doubt," which actively shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s empathy for the voices elevates the "heartbroken reaper" concept beyond a mere label, grounding it in specific action. The internal pivot from cataloging others' fears to confronting their own creates a complete, resonant emotional arc. The choice to name the final fear "Enough" is a character-defining moment of agency and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Nera's characterization as a "lukewarm mage" is brilliantly specific, turning a typically negative trait into a distinct magical philosophy ("warmth for joints and promises") that drives the resolution. Her motivation is clear and active, and the interaction with Aro effectively dramatizes the shift from skepticism to shared ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between her role as warden and her heritage ("spin stories") is compelling and drives the narrative. However, the stranger's immediate identification of her as "Ruth's girl" relies on convenient coincidence rather than earned interaction, slightly weakening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on metaphorical assertions ("doubt like a delicate ring") rather than embodied emotion or difficult micro-choices under pressure. While the internal conflict is clear, the character functions more as a vessel for the theme than a living agent navigating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's internal conflict—suppressing the "self" to become a vessel of safety—is dramatized powerfully through the "muscle memory" sequence. The choice to "lock teeth against pride" demonstrates agency and cost in the heat of the moment, anchoring the character's competence in genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kana's internal conflict is compelling, and the choice to "vivify" the witness demonstrates clear agency. However, interiority relies heavily on elaborate metaphor ("numbness was the quiet court") rather than visceral, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the character's immediate physical experience. The "ego death" trait functions more as a backstory label than a behavior-shaping constraint in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist has a distinct, reflective voice that aligns well with the setting. However, the character operates primarily through narration of successful outcomes rather than struggling through a specific on-page crucible; they feel more like an idealized archetype of an innovator than a flawed individual facing immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s professional solemnity balances perfectly with the surreal premise; the motivation to "restore lost laughter" is dramatized through specific, grounded actions (tuning carburetors) rather than abstract wishing. The interiority regarding "urgency tastes like rain" effectively anchors the character's unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "half cat and half catalog" guardian is a striking, distinct creation with a voice that balances feral threat and librarian fussiness. While the dialogue occasionally drifts into aphoristic philosophy ("certainty had broken me"), the dynamic remains engaging and the shared stasis at the end feels earned by their interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, though it relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("joy hurt") rather than embodied emotion. The repetition of the "stoically sensitive" label feels forced rather than demonstrated through complex choice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's internal landscape is vivid, and the specific memory of the mentor effectively anchors the pivotal choice to discard assumptions. Motivation is distinct and drives the action, though the secondary character (Sela) functions primarily as a mirror rather than an independent force with her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrator's internal landscape is vividly rendered, merging professional duty with metaphysical longing. The "other self" acts effectively as a mirror to externalize the internal conflict, and the final sacrifice is a earned, character-specific choice driven by the established trait of loving the "in between."

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s internal conflict between the safety of geometry and the risk of connection drives every beat. Her choice to enter the arena and confront the "realistically imaginary" witness earns the resolution through prior causality and visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s voice is distinct, blending technical expertise with spiritual yearning in a way that feels earned by the setting. The motivation to navigate by starlight is deeply integrated into every action and observation, creating a coherent internal drive. While Inea provides a necessary human connection, the emotional weight rests firmly on the narrator's internalization of the "aliens' proof." The characterization is vivid, though the "balancedly curious" trait relies on direct exposition rather than dramatization in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist's specific role and motivation are compelling, but the antagonist ("man in a cheap suit") reads as a melodramatic archetype rather than a grounded threat. Eli's emotional pivot from suicidal ideation to laughter feels accelerated for the word count, relying heavily on the magical conceit rather than earned interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Characterization is exemplary; Ivo’s claustrophobia is not merely a trait but a source of active, embodied resistance against his duty, creating visceral tension in every beat. The specific memories of colleagues (Sorel soldering by smell) ground the vigil in genuine loss rather than abstract altruism. His choice to endure the "dark compressing his ribs" to witness the signal enacts a profound Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, and the "counting heartbeats" trait is well-integrated as a coping mechanism. However, motivation is often delivered via exposition ("I tell it why I have climbed back up... to ask for something more") rather than emerging solely through friction and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist is a vivid fusion of mythic archetype and psychological specificity. The literalization of "copper-veined" at the climax transforms a descriptor into a crucial plot mechanic, and the sacrifice of specific memories ("first kiss," "nickname") grounds the surreal stakes in felt human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Character motivation is deeply integrated with the inciting trauma ("missing return") and drives the specific ritualistic actions. The pivot from bitterness to the "stupidest pun" is a distinct, character-specific choice that earns the emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions more as a poetic vehicle than a complex character, lacking internal contradiction or hesitation. The decision to rebel is pre-made, and the execution faces no personal cost or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist is drawn with a distinct, respectful rebellious ethos that anchors the surreal setting. The specific interaction with the boy and the memory of the mother ground the archetype in genuine emotion, though the "mailman" role feels slightly more mythic than psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist functions as a lyrical archetype rather than a living character; he lacks internal contradiction or grit. While his motivation is stated ("interpret silence as possibility"), it remains abstract and philosophical, devoid of the personal stakes or specific vulnerability required to drive genuine empathy. The "memory" of the tightrope singer adds texture but feels convenient rather than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly attuned to the setting, creating a strong sense of internal consistency. However, agency is somewhat reactive; the character largely follows the predecessor's instructions and the library's prompts rather than forcing a high-stakes choice against resistance. The emotional cost is present ("breathed slower") but subtle, reading more as a meditative journey than a crucible of character change.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's interiority is rich, and the shift from capturing to releasing is a distinct arc. However, the pivotal realization is outsourced to a memory of Aria ("She would tell me...") rather than emerging from a high-pressure struggle in the present moment, which lowers the earned agency of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scholar’s internal landscape is rich, grounding the fable in specific grief (the sister) that earns the emotional release. The Locksmith functions effectively as an archetypal catalyst, though his composure borders on omnipotence, lacking a moment of genuine vulnerability or doubt that would deepen the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    The protagonist's specific expertise ("tidewriting," "empirics of rumor") permeates their worldview and drives agency, transforming a standard dive into a coherent ritual. The internal conflict regarding the past debt is dramatized effectively through the "wrong name" correction, resulting in a resonant, character-specific resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Archivist is a distinct, compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—the desire to heal others while remaining trapped in their own exile—creates a rich emotional texture. The mentorship dynamic is dramatized through restraint ("kept my hands folded like gates"), perfectly fulfilling the motivation to "mentor resilience quietly." The character's voice and worldview are unified, authoritative, and deeply empathetic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is an infallible archetype ("wise orchard pruner") rather than a human character. There is no internal conflict, contradiction, or flaw; they possess the solution to every problem immediately, reducing the narrative to a procession of successes without psychological cost or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is distinct, balancing professional detachment with deep empathy ("sometimes see my own face"). The daughter’s agency is well-integrated through the ritual assistance, and the mutual exchange of secrets adds necessary emotional stakes to the magical operation. Internal contradictions are subtle but present in the "lucid unrest" that persists despite the job's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is vividly drawn through "methodically curious" traits and a "shielded openness" that defines every interaction. The choice to prioritize gentleness over force at the climax is fully motivated by the established internal landscape. The emotional discipline required to "interpret silence" is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator's internal landscape of grief is vividly rendered, creating a strong, consistent voice ("spoke in currents"). However, the self-diagnosis ("quietly analytic," "first name basis with death") occasionally feels performative rather than purely embodied. The epiphany ("Let go to live") is earned emotionally, even if the catalyst is melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist is competent and the motivation is clear, but the character lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. They function as a capable vessel for the ritual without a "crucible" moment that forces a difficult choice between competing values. The lack of personal struggle or potential for failure limits the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between "warm curiosity" and "affectionate detachment" is dramatized effectively through the choice to read and the final choice to suppress the knowledge. The confession "I loved her, I think" is slightly expository, but the emotional cost of the "restrained heart" at closure is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist's internal logic is seamlessly constructed, merging professional discipline with profound grief to create a unique worldview. The choice to treat absence as a physical structure is earned by the established "theorem" of the character's mind. The breakdown of scientific objectivity into desperate, magical thinking is portrayed with distinct, embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's specific perceptual constraint (face blindness) is integrated well into the prose and worldview. However, the emotional anchor regarding the father's accident feels inserted rather than earned by the immediate pressure, reading more as a backstory justification than a driver of the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist functions more as a vessel for whimsical observation than a character under pressure; motivation is stated ("wants to chart") rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The lack of internal conflict or struggle makes the apprentice feel static, and the "diligently curious" trait resolves the central problem too easily via the hopscotch board.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist is a cipher defined by his role rather than a specific internal life. Motivation is abstract ("learn the rhythm of repair") and encounters no significant internal contradiction or cost. The character performs a ritual without genuine struggle, lacking the agency or hard choices required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    The collective "We" creates a unified protagonist that lacks internal friction; the declaration that "nobody refused" flattens agency and removes the potential for reluctance or doubt. The characters function as obedient enactors of instructions rather than active agents making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator is a compelling, melancholic archetype whose internal texture ("bruised awe," "copper of regret") creates a strong emotional anchor. The backstory of the girl and the puppet effectively humanizes the abstract duty, grounding the "mercy" in a specific memory. The choice to continue the ritual is earned, though the character remains somewhat static in their resigned vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist's internal conflict between resentment and duty is visceral, grounding the magical elements in emotional reality. The climax—giving away the nut—serves as a powerful moment of renunciation that resolves the character's arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motivation is clear and drives the central action, but interiority relies heavily on stating feelings through metaphor rather than embodied reaction. The brother's sudden pivot from silence to profound thematic dialogue feels slightly rushed and convenient for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator is defined by a distinct vocational voice and a yearning ("to find the place where stories begin") that drives the final beat. The parallel between the customer’s mother and the narrator’s father creates a deep, unforced resonant link, earning the final emotional shift. The choice to "incise" their own counter provides a tangible climax to the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist is a highly competent, sensory-anchored focalizer whose internal landscape perfectly mirrors the magic system. The "cost" of the conflict is effectively embodied in physical reactions ("jaw clenched," "ached"), grounding the abstract concept of memory-tasting in visceral experience. Motivation is clear and professional, though the high competence slightly dampens the sense of personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mara functions as a lyrical device rather than a grounded protagonist; her "ache" and "scales" are poetic assertions without embodied contradiction. The antagonist (councilman) is a straw man who flips instantly upon finding a prop (the glove) without genuine resistance or negotiation. Motivation is abstract ("rehabilitate a conversation") and lacks the grit of a felt human want under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist relies on repetitive self-labeling ("helix-minded engineer") rather than demonstrated traits to define their identity. While the internal ache is described, the emotional arc resolves through an abstract epiphany rather than a pressure-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the label "prism-minded archivist," which is repeated rather than dramatized through distinct interiority. There is little emotional cost or internal conflict; the character functions as a competent vessel for the plot without a clear, individualized arc. The "ache" mentioned at the end feels like a told attribute rather than a felt consequence of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a consistent, lyrical vessel for the story’s philosophy but lacks internal contradiction or struggle. They enter and leave the scene with the same assured mastery, offering no on-page vulnerability or difficult micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrator is distinct, but the student functions largely as a prop for the ritual rather than an agent with conflicting desires. The relationship lacks friction; they agree on the method instantly, and the "cost" of the final move (tipping the king) feels symbolic rather than a difficult, character-defining sacrifice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "eclectic pacifist" persona is distinct, successfully blending mechanical competence with a performative, lyrical interiority ("theatrical sincerity"). The choice to narrate to the lamp creates a unique, lonely warmth that grounds the abstraction. However, the emotional stakes feel slightly curated; the protagonist's immediate acceptance of the empty diary ("I am not disappointed") bypasses a potential moment of vulnerability or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara functions as an idealized sage rather than a conflicted protagonist; her "ambition" meets no significant resistance that forces a hard choice or error. She navigates the narrative with perfect competence, lacking the internal contradictions or flaws required to generate genuine character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist is a competent focalizer with a clear motivation rooted in the mother's legacy. However, internal conflict is minimal; the pilot functions primarily as a delivery mechanism for the plot-resolving artifact rather than a character forced to make difficult tradeoffs. The "hands shake" moment attempts to portray struggle, but the choice to heal the arch is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is a competent professional with clear agency, driving the investigation through expertise. However, the character functions more as a method than a person; emotional interiority is somewhat abstract ("learning to move before the air decides"), relying on the "ghost" of the engineer to supply the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist serves as a functional vessel for the magic system rather than a fully realized character with grounded agency. The motivation ("certify wonder") is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or internal contradiction. The "danger" of sleep is navigated without visible struggle or hesitation, resulting in a competence-heavy performance that lacks human vulnerability or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s internal arc from a driven relic keeper defined by failure to a teacher "teaching edges to share" is compelling and well-executed. The internal conflict is dramatized effectively through the ritual, though the "twin valley" figure functions more as a mirror than a distinct character, which fits the solitary scope.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The operator’s trait of borrowing personalities is brilliantly dramatized with physical cost ("scratches"), moving beyond a quirk to a central plot mechanic. The relationship shifts organically from professional observation to shared intimacy under the pressure of the vanishing stars, earning the final moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with the mentor's absence and the discipline of the trade is well-rendered. However, the specific trait "jittery" functions more as an atmospheric descriptor than a driver of behavior; the courier acts with calm competence throughout, leaving the "jittery" flaw undramatized in the actual decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara is consistent as a guide, but the narrator functions largely as a passive recipient of the magical experience until the final beat. The emotional connection to the father appears suddenly without prior grounding in the narrator's interiority, making the climax feel more like a magical convenience than an earned character realization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, particularly in the pivotal micro-choice to reject the "thinning" sacrifice to ensure her sister has a home to return to. The emotional logic is sound, though the characterization leans slightly toward the archetypal rather than the specific. Her competence with the ritual feels earned and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the costs paid (surname, laughter) are specific and poignant. However, the "meek" label is told rather than shown, as their actions display confident mastery and bravery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's sensory interiority is vivid and distinct, grounding the surreal premise in concrete experience. However, the character feels somewhat deterministic ("They built me to be a bridge"), which muffles the sense of active personal struggle in the choice to release the voices. The motivation is clear, but the lack of internal resistance or contradictory impulses makes the final decision feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist's "reticence" is beautifully dramatized in the kitchen scene ("shape of silence"), validating the trait beyond mere assertion. However, explicit self-diagnosis ("I was not brave," "I am reticent") slightly flattens the characterization into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict is sharp and drives the plot: the “betrayal” of their own impulsive laugh causes the crisis, creating a genuine struggle between discipline and elation. The “custodian” persona is grounded in specific, competent actions (handling the wick, reading the gale), balancing the mythic tone with tangible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal struggle with the "borrowed thunder" of the donor heart is compellingly embodied, creating a strong emotional arc that resolves in a shift from "patient" to "harbor." The dye master serves as an effective catalyst, challenging the protagonist's worldview with specific, grounded actions rather than just abstract advice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist is a distinct, cohesive voice with a specific worldview ("quiet trade of mops and maps"). While the struggle is more contemplative than conflicted by contradictory impulses, the singular obsession with the trees drives the narrative effectively. The "embarrassingly tender" motive lands well, grounding high-concept magic in human vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator functions as a competent, mythic vessel rather than a psychologically distinct character. While motivation is clear, they lack internal contradiction or a moment where the "fear" mentioned forces a difficult trade-off; the protagonist is a perfect tool for the plot's ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist is defined largely by initial labels ("compassionate recluse") rather than dramatized behavior; the "recluse" trait only surfaces as a retrospective realization rather than a resistance that complicates the scene. Her motivation is clear, but the internal shift feels guided by the librarian's instruction rather than earned through a difficult, cost-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator is defined largely by the prompt's label ("creeping normality noticer") rather than organic characterization, and the motivation is explicitly stated ("to find the sacred...") rather than purely dramatized. However, Maro’s confession about selling herbs to developers adds a necessary, albeit brief, layer of complicity and depth to the cast.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator is exceptionally drawn; the tension between the title "orderly records chief" and the subversive act of "revising metadata" to save a vow creates deep, earned characterization. The choice to actively intervene rather than just record transforms the archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist is sharply defined by a distinct motivation that prioritizes understanding over revenge, driving high-agency tactical choices. The internal conflict is resolved through a tangible sacrifice (leaving the map) that validates her "moonshine runner's daughter" legacy without repeating her father's mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator is labeled a "skeptic," but their behavior is uniformly credulous; they accept the magical logic and Naira's explanations without the friction or resistance that the trait implies. While the internal sensory experience is rich, the protagonist functions more as a passive observer of the ritual than an active agent driving the plot through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the narrative from the first paragraph. The shift from the mechanical "locksmith" mindset to the vulnerability of art is well-earned through memory and action. The trait "mnemonically gifted" is slightly expository in its introduction ("I am mnemonically gifted") but is successfully dramatized through the recall of faces and the lock combination.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's specific physical trait—wilting near dishonesty—is not merely cosmetic but functions as a central constraint during the climax, forcing a high-stakes confession. The internal landscape is vivid, and the motivation to find lost conversations feels earned by the lyrical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara functions as a competent archetype rather than a complex character; she faces no genuine internal conflict, doubt, or temptation. Her "seasonal muteness" acts as a world-building label rather than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off under pressure. The emotional arc is one of performative success without the risk of failure or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s internal "static" effectively mirrors the external magnetic chaos, driving the choice to burn the farm to save it. The voice is highly distinct, blending technical constraints with deep nostalgia ("haunted by toys I only simulate") in a way that feels earned rather than programmed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by prompt labels ("discerning thrift-store curator," "leads through following") rather than embodied drives. The interiority feels performed and aphoristic ("mouth fills with our own weather") rather than psychological, resulting in a cipher who delivers thematic sermons instead of making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is stylistically distinct but statically portrayed; the "calm defiance" reads more as an immunity to pressure than a complex trait. Neri functions primarily as a prompt for the protagonist's exposition rather than a character with agency or distinct interiority. The emotional arc is stated via metaphors ("encrypt vulnerability") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ilya is drawn with precise, embodied interiority; the physical sensation of the "pocket of absence" grounds his grief in a tangible constraint. His motivation is clear and urgent, and the interaction with the crystallized voice feels earned rather than melodramatic. The choice to seek the deleted memory is well-supported by the backstory of the "licensed forgetting."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    The protagonist is highly competent but static; he performs a ritual without internal conflict, doubt, or personal cost. While the "humility of listening" is a trait, it functions as a superpower rather than a source of friction or vulnerability. The lack of a difficult choice or contradictory impulse flattens the character arc into a procedural execution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator and tutor are vividly drawn figures within the story's lyrical logic, but they function more as archetypes than people under pressure. While the narrator's desire to learn is clear, the lack of contradictory impulses or internal resistance makes the final agreement feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won choice. The characterization relies heavily on metaphor (e.g., "heart is a workshop") rather than demonstrated behavior in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist's transformation from "charmed skeptic" to "door" is compelling and deeply rooted in the relationship with Reina. The internal conflict is embodied well in the physical interaction with the shell, though the specific trigger for the change feels slightly reliant on the atmospheric "tonight" rather than acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist's specific philosophy ("calibrated treason") creates a distinct internal landscape that elevates the archetype. The choice to leave the personal "door" closed provides a necessary moment of renunciation, grounding the magical competence in human limitation. Internal conflict regarding the extent of the modification ("unhouse" vs "unlatch") is well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist relies on diagnostic self-labeling ("I am richly perceptive") rather than demonstrated traits, which flattens interiority. The emotional arc is smooth and lacks genuine doubt or struggle; competence is declared rather than tested by the opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is a competent, atmospheric functionary who drives the ritual with clear motivation ("salvage something pure"). However, the character reads more as a role than a person; internal conflict is minimal, and the "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" self-definition feels like an inserted label rather than an organic identity. The ghost’s agency in choosing the globe adds a welcome spark of specific characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The philosopher is a compelling, distinct archetype whose motivation (teaching/seeing patterns) consistently drives the narrative. However, he functions as a static wisdom figure in a fable structure, lacking the internal struggle or contradictory impulses required for the highest band of characterization. The secondary characters are well-drawn foils that illuminate his nature.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s skepticism is consistently embodied in voice and action, avoiding stock cynicism. The shift from ruthless debunking to protecting the caretaker's secret feels earned by the specific interaction and carries a visible change in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrator is defined by function rather than internal conflict, operating as an archetype in a fable-like summary. While motivation is stated, the lack of a specific, dramatized "crucible" moment limits emotional interiority. Kestrel remains a symbol ("smiles like a cracked moon") rather than a fully realized character.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist is distinct, with a consistent voice that balances whimsy with a grounded sense of loss. The backstory regarding the mother effectively deepens the motivation, transforming the "vagrant poet" archetype into a specific character seeking atonement through connection.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's internal duality—lighthouse logic versus crypt emotion—creates a compelling, specific interiority. The antagonist's rapid shift from greed to grief is earned through the shared sensory experience, though his initial archetypal nature limits the score slightly. The emotional arc is authentic, grounding the magical realism in felt human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The protagonist is static and idealized, functioning more as a thematic mouthpiece than a struggling individual; they express no internal doubt or flaw. The opposition (Kerr/Council) is a straw man that yields without significant resistance, denying the protagonist a crucible for character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is clear and leads to a costly choice, but the reliance on diagnostic label-speak ("cultivated fortified vulnerability") to define internal state weakens the characterization. The final action is strong, but the self-definition feels like a prompt insertion rather than organic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—balancing pastoral care with the need for concrete justice—is compelling and drives the narrative arc. However, the voices of the two characters converge significantly; Mara speaks in the same highly metaphorical, lyrical register as the narrator ("songs they played before were knives"), which diminishes her distinct presence and makes the dialogue feel staged rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and audacious ("allergic to common sense"), establishing a strong persona. However, the protagonist lacks a "crucible" moment; her traits facilitate linear success without forcing a difficult trade-off or exposing a genuine flaw under pressure. The lack of internal conflict makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist is defined by a distinct, melancholic internal voice that drives the narrative logic from the first line. The choice to reject the whistleblower path in favor of a private, conceptual mercy ("let deletion be a home") is a profound character beat that establishes agency and moral complexity. The internal conflict between the corporate role and personal "attentiveness" is resolved with a felt cost—the weight of the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator is distinct, with a voice that blends professional detachment and poetic introspection ("shadow-laced peacekeeper"). However, the envoys transition from hostility to cooperation too rapidly, driven more by the magical prop than by interpersonal friction or the narrator's specific agency. The "cut thumb" moment offers a glimpse of internal struggle, but the protagonist ultimately functions more as a facilitator than a character forced into a difficult dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's arc from seeking an ending to postponing it is well-motivated and tracked through specific internal shifts. The "grips reality loosely" trait is effectively dramatized by the choice to volunteer, grounding the abstract desire in concrete action. The interaction with Mikko serves as a strong catalyst for the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator's interiority as a "keeper of pauses" and the traveler's embodied distress create a strong, immediate dynamic. The Sentinel’s specific backstory with the letter fragment grounds their wisdom in personal loss rather than abstract platitude, earning the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lio is a compelling, specific character whose backstory actively informs her competence and worldview ("unwilling to polish ruin"). The relationship effectively casts the narrator as a witness to her expertise, though the narrator's own agency is somewhat muted compared to Lio's.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist functions more as an archetypal vessel for the concept than a flawed individual; traits like "perceptively calm" are self-diagnosed labels rather than demonstrated behaviors. Internal friction is low, and the "tremble of devotion" reads as romanticized self-perception rather than genuine cost. The conflict with Ole is resolved via a thematic speech rather than character pressure, making the archivist feel somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scholar’s interiority is richly specific, grounding the abstract premise in a distinct worldview ("relieved of definitions yet heavy with possibilities"). His pivotal choice to demonstrate rather than argue aligns perfectly with his reticent nature, creating a coherent character arc. The internal landscape of "memory and hope braided" effectively drives his external actions.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s paradoxical condition—precognitive forgetfulness—is masterfully integrated into agency and tactical choices (chalking instructions, planting driftwood). Internal conflict between the urge to hold on and the inevitability of erasure is embodied in every action, leading to a deeply earned emotional resonance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "sage" moniker feels self-ascribed and expository rather than demonstrated through complex agency; the character's competence is asserted via poetic intuition ("listen to machines like stories") rather than dramatized skill. The connection to Lina provides emotional grounding, but the internal arc resolves through abstract reflection ("let her thought restructure me") rather than a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator’s professional serenity is well-established through the specific dogma that kindness is a "practice," motivating the persistence with the phone call. However, Lena functions largely as a plot device, arriving and reconciling with minimal friction or distinct personality beyond her "wind hair." The emotional resolution feels slightly unearned due to the lack of resistance or palpable interpersonal struggle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s voice is distinct, blending technical precision with lyrical interiority ("restless math," "apprenticed to dust"). The arc from a desire for mastery to a "patient" humility is earned through the interaction with the Archivist. The "missing edge" at the end serves as a subtle, embodied cost of the character's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and lyrical, but the "skeptic" trait feels nominal; he accepts magical elements (sap maps, hedge breath) with the instant fluidity of a believer, undermining the internal conflict. The motive to redeem his past error is clear, but the "shrewdly innocent" tag applied to both child characters feels repetitive rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for poetic observation rather than a distinct agent under pressure; the pivotal choice regarding the pearl is recounted in summary without immediate, embodied struggle or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's interiority is rich but relies heavily on diagnostic self-labeling ("What I am now is quietly proactive") rather than purely dramatized traits. Miri serves as a supportive foil, and while their dynamic is gentle and functional, the lack of interpersonal friction keeps the emotional pressure low. The choice to repurpose the pendant is well-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator's internal conflict is lucidly stated but remains abstract ("conflicted," "divided"), lacking visceral, embodied grit. Secondary characters function as symbolic mouthpieces for the theme rather than living entities, delivering high-concept dialogue ("that was erasure") that feels didactic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.4)
    Lio is an idealized archetype without interiority, doubt, or struggle; his competence is absolute, reducing him to a plot function rather than a character. There are no contradictory impulses or costs to his actions, and the villagers act as a compliant chorus rather than generating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's motivation is deeply embodied in the "scar on her wrist" and the specific history with her mother. Her competence with the "flash paper" and "starlight" feels earned and distinct, creating a strong sense of character agency. The internal drive to find Fen anchors the magical procedure in tangible emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    The protagonist possesses a distinct, lyrical voice that suits the fable-like quality of the piece, and the "peripheral focus" trait is actively used to solve the scene's problem. However, the character functions more as a vessel for the extended metaphor than as a person with genuine internal contradiction or vulnerability. The motivation ("to store wonder") is abstract and stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist's motivation to collect burdens is clear, though they function more as an archetype than a fully fleshed individual. The internal conflict regarding the choice to stay is introduced late and resolved somewhat quickly, but the moment of "pulse slowing" effectively physicalizes the realization of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The widow's characterization is grounded in specific, embodied details like the "wrist ache" and the "hauntingly practical" craft learned from the husband. Her internal landscape is rich, blending memory with the immediate physical task, though the emotional trajectory is slightly predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose internal conflict—survival versus the peace of stillness—is externalized effectively through the ghost. Her resolute nature drives the plot, and the final choice to sacrifice a cherished memory of hope ("floating library") to restart the relentless machinery creates a legible, high-stakes emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara is competent and distinct, but lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses. Her journey is linear execution without a moment of doubt, fear, or difficult choice that forces a trade-off; she acts as a pure vehicle for the theme rather than a pressured individual.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist’s internal conflict—silence as armor versus the desire for resonance—is articulated with deep, embodied emotion. The renunciation of the "anthem" for a "lullaby" demonstrates a mature, character-specific choice that earns the final state of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "legend seeker" persona provides a consistent, elevated voice that fits the fable-noir tone, though the internal monologue occasionally drifts into melodrama ("older than the river"). The protagonist's competence is well-dramatized in the climax ("training instincts"), and the partnership with the watchman adds necessary human grounding to the mythic posturing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's motivation is distinct and drives the fable-like narrative effectively. The fisherman’s shift from skepticism to alliance is grounded in the grandmother backstory ("hum to the nets"), though his conversion feels slightly frictionless given the stakes. The dynamic is cooperative rather than high-pressure, which fits the tone but limits the "crucible" effect on character revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a passive vessel for the concept; their motivation ("understand the geography of healing") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes pressure. The final choice to stay feels like a gentle drift in the current rather than a decision forged in a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist is well-drawn, with specific physical details ("oil-stained cuffs") grounding the archetype. His interior conflict—kneeling to metal while seeking beauty—drives agency, and his final choice to accept "compromise" feels earned by his on-page labor and refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's identity and ritual are compelling, but her internal state feels described rather than fully embodied in difficult choices. The interaction with the boy is gentle and lacks the friction needed to reveal character depth beyond the stated "compassion."

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's internal conflict regarding their father grounds the high-concept "luminous skeptic" archetype in genuine emotion. The confession beat deepens characterization significantly, though the opening relies on self-labeling ("They called me...") rather than demonstrated behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and their motivation ("share light without fire") drives the narrative logic effectively. The emotional landscape is vivid, though the interiority occasionally leans into abstract labeling ("grief were pollen") rather than grounded reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and the "meditative" attribute is well-dramatized through the ribbon method. However, the grandmother's role as a guide somewhat dampens the protagonist's own agency in the climax, making the internal struggle feel slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator's internal landscape is rendered with exceptional specificity, blending professional duty with personal grief. The shift from judging the town to judging the self (finding their own name on the handle) is a profound, earned reversal that complicates the motivation and deepens the character arc within a short space.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rowan is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose internal landscape matches the story’s lyrical tone. His motivation ("to discover the shape of intentions") drives the action, though the lack of visceral personal risk or deep internal conflict limits the character's dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or personal stakes; they function as a flawless vehicle for wisdom rather than a character making difficult choices. The "struggle" is purely professional and intellectual, with no emotional cost or vulnerability exposed in the confrontation with the Council.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose specific skills as a copyist drive the story's unique magic system (annotating lyrics to animate dust). Her agency is clearly demonstrated when she chooses to "unshawl" the radio despite the established danger of the patrols, accepting the risk to answer the signal. The internal motivation ("teach dust to tell stories") perfectly aligns with her actions and the story's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Soren's vulnerability is effectively rendered through physical cues like the flinch and the specific quality of his laugh. The narrator’s distinct role and internal philosophy create a consistent, grounded presence, though the "mystic facilitator" archetype feels slightly stylized.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly aligned with the "rationally rebellious" trait. However, the reliance on summary rather than dramatized scene limits the display of micro-choices under immediate pressure; we are told of the refusal of the factions rather than seeing the negotiation play out in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist serves as a wise facilitator rather than a character under genuine pressure; while the redefinition of "expectantly resigned" at the end adds conceptual depth, they face no risk of failure or personal cost. The characterization relies on the "healer" archetype, resulting in a static internal arc despite the external success.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist's self-description ("People call me informally wise") relies on telling rather than demonstrated behavior, and Kye functions more as a compliant thematic prop than a resistant agent. The emotional trajectory is smooth and lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or interpersonal crucible; Kye's conversion to rebellion is instant and unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator's voice is distinct, blending technical function with a mythic, candid sensibility ("speech exited me involuntarily truthful"). The motivation to preserve wonder is clear and drives the choice to use the "dowry." However, the "truth" constraint functions more as flavor than a crucible; the decision to help feels immediate rather than a struggle against the compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrator's interiority is distinct and lyrical, establishing a consistent voice and worldview ("houses are conversations"). However, the prompt-mandated label "creeping normality noticer" reads as awkward exposition rather than a natural identity, and the emotional stakes—while poetic—lack the visceral friction or embodied cost required for higher bands. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist acts as an ideal thematic agent rather than a character with internal contradictions or genuine struggle. While the voice is distinct, the narrator faces no meaningful resistance or flawed impulses; they resolve every issue with perfect "incisively kind" competence, resulting in a lack of dramatic friction or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "grim optimist" persona is not just a label but the structural engine of the piece, driving the refusal to stop climbing. The protagonist’s internal logic is consistent and compellingly distinct, turning a surreal metaphor into a grounded character study. Motivation is razor-sharp: the "texture of a missed opportunity" anchors the abstract setting in a deeply human desire.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Anya is a clearly motivated protagonist whose actions align perfectly with her "methodically hopeful" attribute. However, she functions more as a thematic vessel than a conflicted individual; the lack of internal resistance or doubt makes her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator possesses a distinct "cultured" voice, but the lack of internal contradiction or hesitation lowers tension; they feel perfectly competent throughout. The transition from "dread" to "discipline" is asserted rather than earned through a difficult, cost-laden decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator is realized with striking specificity; "neatly inventive because necessity edits vanity" is a defining, character-driven axiom. His agency is absolute, driving the mechanism and accepting the "bleak exhilaration" of his choice. The emotional cost—feeding regrets to the stone—lands with weight, creating a portrait of obsession and love that feels fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—loving the ringmaster who drowned them—creates a visceral, messy emotional core that grounds the surrealism. The realization of the advisor's nature feels earned through the act of confession, though the shift from obedience to mastery is rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    The protagonist is highly competent, with motivation grounded effectively in the backstory of the father's loss. His agency is absolute, driving every beat of the defense through specific, skilled action. While he lacks a deep on-page internal flaw or contradiction to heighten the psychological stakes, the "vow" provides sufficient emotional ballast for the magical realism mode. The characterization succeeds as a focused archetype of the expert practitioner.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's professional lens (cartography and acoustics) perfectly filters the narrative voice, making the interiority specific and earned. The shift from patience to resolve is dramatized effectively, and the emotional landing ("stings and steadies") feels genuine to the character's defined traits.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara is an archetype defined by labels ("emotionally rational") rather than internal conflict; she faces no genuine dilemma or cost. Tomas functions solely as a plot device who abandons his lifelong worldview after a single mild rebuttal.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    The character's interiority is rich, but they function primarily as a thematic vessel; motivation is stated ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than dramatized through high-stakes choice. The attribute "stoically sensitive" feels inserted via meta-commentary rather than organically enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist's characterization is inextricably linked to their profession, driving the central conflict between personal grievance and archival integrity. The refusal to let "rage propel the index" is a profound, earned moral choice that defines the character through action. The internal voice is consistent, blending technical precision with deep emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, and the pivot from seeking Lio to accepting "balance" is a strong, earned realization. The emotional arc feels authentic, rooted in the ritualistic labor of the lanterns. However, the "simple and unbearable" motive lacks on-page contradictory impulses until the very end; the struggle is more endured than wrestled with dynamically.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s identity as a survivor is not merely backstory but the causal engine of the climax; the refusal to mine the site proceeds directly from their history of being a target. Internal conflict is palpable, balancing the need for purpose ("keeps me from unraveling") against the moral cost of the discovery. The choice to lock the coordinates is a character-specific exertion of agency that feels earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pilot’s internal voice is distinct and drives the narrative, particularly in the technical translation of spiritual longing. However, the pilgrim functions more as a symbolic vessel than a fully realized character, with traits like being "perpetually surprised" told via repetition rather than dramatized through complex choices. The relationship feels like a safe, complementary archetype pairing rather than a crucible of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s guilt is embodied and drives the narrative, with the revelation of his own paternity effectively deepening the arc. However, the connection to his own history relies heavily on a fortuitous discovery rather than active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator is defined primarily by their role and self-description ("listening without flinching") rather than deep internal contradiction. While the intervention with Daro demonstrates agency, the explicit self-labeling ("uncommonly thoughtful") feels expository, and the narrator's competence renders the central conflict somewhat safe.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's motivation to reconcile ("align heart and action") is clear and drives the scene effectively. However, the interiority relies heavily on labeled emotions ("merrily melancholic," "broken navigator") rather than purely dramatized feeling, which creates a slight distance. The confession feels earned, though the emotional resolution is somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The protagonist's internal conflict—memory erased but conscience awake—drives the narrative with precision. The specific confession of arson ("fire I set for money") grounds the abstract quest in a tangible, felt cost that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The protagonist's motivation to reunite is clear, but the interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("grief wants me to break") rather than embodied psychology. A central contradiction weakens the arc: the character claims to be "wary of the reluctant metamorphosis," yet actively begs for it and rushes into the transformation without a dramatized moment of hesitation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation is visceral and distinct, grounding the magical profession in the universal ache of parental time-anxiety. The internal conflict ("joy and dread braid") drives the ritual logically, and the cost paid in specific behavioral promises gives weight to the character's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist's pacifism is not merely a trait but a hard constraint that forces the rejection of the warhead solution, directly shaping the plot. The internal conflict between "weight" (grief) and the need for levity is dramatized effectively through the gravity mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mara serves more as a thematic vessel than a grounded protagonist; her motivation ("to understand the texture of transformation") reads as abstract philosopher-speak rather than embodied drive. While her "destitute philanthropist" trait is consistent, the specific method of leaving rescue tools around randomly feels like a plot device rather than a credible character behavior. The emotional connection to the boy is functional but lacks the texture of a genuine relationship formed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator is a consistent focalizer, but they function more as a vessel for poetic voice than a character under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; the protagonist moves through the plot with perfect competence and no hesitation. The trait "calmly inventive" is stated and enacted, but the emotional landscape feels somewhat decorative rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator is distinct, driven by a compelling blend of mathematical obsession and romantic longing. The internal conflict between the "sliding futures" and the desperate need to anchor the present via promise is vivid and well-rendered. While the "her" remains somewhat archetypal, the protagonist's specific interiority ("hum the numbers until they taste like salt") grounds the surreal premise in genuine need.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ilya’s internal landscape is vivid, creating a strong sense of burdened purpose, but Mara functions primarily as a thematic mirror rather than a distinct agent. Her dialogue voice renders indistinguishably from the narrator’s lyrical interiority ("storms borrow the face of truth"), causing voice convergence that flattens the character dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The protagonist's voice and professional ethos are distinct, blending mechanics with philosophy effectively. The transition from guarded duel to shared vulnerability is well-motivated by the "refusal to humiliate," though the character remains somewhat archetypal and distant due to the high-concept tone.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is a distinct, grounded presence with a backstory that informs her physical actions (prying bars). The narrator's "molting" trait, however, remains an asserted label rather than a driver of tactical shifts; he acts with a singular, consistent poetic voice throughout. The relationship offers warmth but lacks friction or evolving status dynamics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist's interiority is vivid, with a distinct emotional baseline of grief. However, the resolution feels slightly unearned emotionally; the "timetable of blame" dissolves too easily upon reunion, lacking the friction of a difficult choice or renunciation that characterizes the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrator is a competent archetype (the mystical bureaucrat) who performs the ritual with expertise but lacks internal friction. While the voice is distinct, the "luminous doubt" is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices; the protagonist follows the "tug" of the island rather than struggling against genuine temptation or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and consistent, anchoring the "slow-spoken" trait well. However, agency is somewhat passive; the protagonist follows a set of external instructions (the lace) rather than making difficult choices under pressure, making the character feel more like a vessel for the ritual than a driver of conflict.

    Exceptional interiority via embodied listening ("sap move like sea within a sea") and vow-rooted motivation; contradictory defiance-as-conversation acts in fractal strikes, earning endurance with past father's loss as felt cost.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, concrete, and POV-bound: “hands still tasting of salt and metal,” “sky is made of ripped plastic.” The neutron-star lens gives consistent perceptual bias; micro-choices (chalk-marks, tape, half-light reopening) enact the “strip needless drama” motive with visible trade-offs. Flaw: the botanist’s late entrance is only sketched; we get no contrasting voice or status shift, so relationship-as-crucible is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the final renunciation of heroics for slope-tending is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The artist’s turn from furnace-roar to “listening between” is fully embodied; every beat of the trek through frost and kiln is a micro-choice that re-prices his hands’ relation to heat. The final decision to cast a glass “river of rest” is earned by the kiln’s low hum and the mentor’s off-stage authority, with the ledger strip as tangible cost. Internal contradiction is alive in the same breath that wants both quiet and luminosity. No safety-hedging: he carries literal ash of the crime into the new making.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The survivor’s vow to “translate silence into music” is embodied in every beat—tuning-fork taps, thermal coding, sleeve-sealed titles—so the inner contradiction (need sound / trapped silence) stays live. Micro-choices (threading forks into snow, softening code for a sobbing child) visibly cost time and body-heat, earning the final Earned Stasis. Sura’s silently expressive hands create authentic status shifts without dialogue. No stock interiority; each frost trace is a character-specific hieroglyph.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The undertaker’s grief-fatigue (“grief runs me the way water wears a channel”) is viscerally embodied; his stubbornness is not asserted but performed in the dive and the ledger work. Interior contradiction is present—shame at being the scatterer of signals—yet the final self-assignment of addresses feels slightly sudden; the causal bridge from shame to naming could be one beat sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s gently-persistent authority is embodied in micro-gestures (tap the bell, breathe across it) that steer the communal ritual without pushing. Interior contradictions surface when Noor’s hunger for credit collides with elders’ silence-rule, forcing Farid and Noor to trade roles on the midnight run; the bell’s weight-loss literalizes their earned mutual regard. The final refusal to ring the bell is a renunciation with social cost—trust survives only if praise stays nameless. One hairline slip: the collective narrator’s emotional lens is coherent but remains slightly collective-therapeutic (“we will show each other”) rather than individually pierced, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush, embodied, and contradicted in real time (“bellows pull open the small room of light” vs. “breath not taken once the door closed”). The micro-choice to widen the diaphragm literally admits the woman and reconfigures the chest-arch love-store—an earned, visible cost. Flaw: slight over-articulation of the healing thesis in the final paragraph; the kettle-of-steam image already showed it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge-maze designer’s obsession with mapping time is vivid, embodied in tactile choices (handling shard, unfolding photos). The internal contradiction—wanting to trap time yet fearing entrapment—acts simultaneously in the “quaking reverie” beat. The final renunciation of the photographs’ ghosts carries visible cost: the images blank to snow, foreclosing nostalgic anchoring. Flaw: the retrocognitive trait is stated more than dramatized; we’re told “trapped” rather than shown a specific memory that endangers him.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chained liberator’s motive—planting seeds not for trade but for future whistling children—grounds every micro-choice; the chain-on-ankle literalizes inherited obligation without slipping into allegory. Interiority stays concrete: “I hook my chain to the bench leg so nobody can drag me away” marries tactic to psychology. The decision to impede Collectors by becoming immovable cargo crystallizes her flaw—indebtedness—as tactical virtue, paid for by the same chain that once confined her. One hairline slip: “staggering grace” leans toward label, not embodied contradiction, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s synesthetic need to “hear colors” and the obsession with finding the “sound of trust breaking” give a jagged, specific interiority; every micro-choice—seeding cochlear organoids, burning the oilskin note—grows from that flaw and costs him distance from his father. The final moment of letting the aid hum “a kindness…honest and cold” is earned renunciation that forecloses revenge while keeping ache legible. Secondary characters stay off-stage; the single-POV crucible holds, so relationship/status bullets are waived. Only the father’s dialogue edges toward thematic summary, a hairline slip that caps the score at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thief’s contradictory impulse—stealing light yet giving it—drives every beat; the mirrored encounter with the older self crystallizes a credible, costly renunciation. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“jar hums like a heartbeat”), never abstract. micro-choice to release, not capture, the moonbeams forecloses his habitual identity with visible, felt price. Relationship with florist only off-page; no status shift, so relationship crucible bullet waived.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is sensorially embodied and idiosyncratic—"taste of old oil and library dust anchors me"—and every micro-choice (counting breaths, bookmark between teeth) declares a hierarchy of values under pressure. The mentor’s absence is still a relationship that forces present stance; the self-to-past dynamic is treated as a crucible. No stock phrases; contradictions (shy yet proud flame) stay physically grounded. The only minus is a hair of safety-hedging: the narrator’s perfection in ritual could risk too immaculate calibration, but the audible stutter of generator and cracked bell keep flaw alive.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—panic-level phobia versus stunt-trained muscle memory—are dramatized in every beat (hands shake / body still moves). The final refusal to pull Kellan up is credibly mined from that split, so the renunciation carries cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak, and the micro-choice to thread the projector before the confrontation shows values in action. One minor slip: “I am firmly adaptive” is self-label mid-crisis; a dramatized beat of coral-like rebuilding would have sealed the trait on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scribe’s “mild obsession” is shown through micro-choices: the slow hand that refuses to stab lines, the ear that re-tunes to silence. Interiority is concrete and biased—distances “no compass could name”—but the arc is narrated more than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet not visibly costly on the page. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the obsession simply yields to teaching. Still, the voice-specific noticing keeps characterization vivid and mostly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist’s interior contradiction—mechanical composure vs. the salt-tingle urge to “amalgamate”—is dramatized in feathered micro-choices under iterative pressure. The dot-marking chest panel, slower sweep, and final pause are visible micro-costs that foreclose the quota-driven path. No stock therapy-speak; even the epiphany is rendered as physical puddle-comma. The only hairline slip: the motive phrase “find where thoughts come from” is stated twice without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The registrar’s interior contradiction—fear of exposure vs need for transparency—remains stated in lyric summary rather than dramatised in a single moment of micro-choice; the shared silence with Rell registers as parallel confession rather than crucible that alters relationship state. The final “we learned” abstracts the cost, muting embodied emotion. Still, the occupation-specific duties and ledger guilt ground the motive and the lens-owning beat shows clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s motives—guilt, reclamation, and the need to outwit quantified fate—are legible through embodied ritual (polishing marbles, ribbon ceremonies). Interior contradiction surfaces when he confesses past lies yet re-uses their angles, showing a credible hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with cost: he forfeits societal legitimacy to keep the maze’s private acceptance, an earned renunciation foreshadowed by “three winters” survival. Micro-choices (kneeling Auditor, hat-rejection arch) tighten status dynamics without headcount clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hale’s quiet obsession with “sideways time” is embodied in every micro-choice—tuning heaters, anchoring the nexus, easing the lever back—so the final renunciation feels earned. Sera’s single line about gentleness crystallizes a relationship under pressure without overt exposition. Only the brief “ruptured balloon” backstory drifts toward label-speak, slightly blunting interior contradiction at the hinge beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The musician’s interior contradiction—obedience to art vs obedience to a ghost—is embodied in the rosin-on-paper micro-choice that triggers the rescue. His muted panic, tactile reverence for the program, and willingness to weaponize a harmonic show a hierarchy of values that crystallizes under pressure. The arc from passive listening to active disruption earns the “lately inspired” cost: he forfeits professional decorum and assumes the ghost’s risk. No label-speak; every thought is a physical sensation or action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s guilt-riven interiority is embodied in fever-chilled, aurora-lit perception and the graphite smudge that reweights memory; silence is dramatized as a weighable, glacier-like mass. Motive stays consistent: protect Luca’s name and the wedding convoy by swallowing truth, then expiate by broadcasting risk. The micro-choice to lift the loose graphite onto the scale crystallizes this arc with visible cost—O.4 mg of shame made legible. Only minor slack: late-introduced “director” and donor camera feel briefly convenient rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs. reflexive skepticism—live in scene: turning the beaded wheel while tasting soap/oil/pleading, feeling beads bite skin. Interiority is concrete (“drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes”), never diagnostic; the micro-choice to turn the wheel costs blood and belief. The swallowed tag becomes a coin against gum, a bodily refusal to relinquish the mass of swallowed truth. Earned Stasis lands: he carries the weight, foreclosing the mother-erased version of his father; cost is the taste of metal and the click of life’s gears he cannot un-hear.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Chronicler’s interiority is lyrically rich yet static; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, and the climactic shift from “writing to tending” is asserted rather than embodied. Child interaction supplies one micro-choice—opening a new door—but the keeper’s stake in that moment remains observational, so motivation never tightens under pressure. The final stance costs nothing we witness on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    The therapist’s “softly adaptive” premise is dramatized: every micro-choice—asking permission, letting the bowl breathe, inviting Felix to map memory onto sound—tilts the present. Interiority stays concrete (“cautious exuberance tucked like a heartbeat”) and contradicts itself under pressure—hope against fear of forcing the child. The curl hand-off crystallizes a status shift: Lena yields custodial control, the therapist accepts custodial risk, Felix witnesses adults trading guardianship of his silence. Cost is felt: the therapist’s earlier hedged hope is replaced by audible responsibility when Felix sings “mama” and the eclipse ends—an earned reopening that could still fail.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The odd historian’s interiority is vivid—he “coaxes” sounds from walls with breath and aligns his spine to an unseen axis—yet he remains more receptor than actor. His only decisive micro-choice is to pin the tapestry above the hearth, a gesture that re-activates the silo’s voice but costs him nothing we feel. The arc traces accumulation, not transformation; he ends as listener-scribe, so the renunciation is intellectual, not visceral. Still, his perceptual lens is so singular that the character feels irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s interiority is lyrically specific—“nudging what was already leaning,” “ledger inside your ribs”—and her orchestrator role is embodied through the micro-dot placement; the final renunciation of the booklet under the tea tin shows cost. Yet the arriving townsfolk remain sketches whose contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized, so relationship pressure stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s thinning voice and Ruan’s looped hush create a credible, embodied tension; the final micro-choice—palette set down without pull—earns its cost through prior grammatical footwork. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the entity’s voice never fully dual-voices Mara in the same beat, so the apex of simultaneous impulse is asserted more than dramatized. Still, motivation, flaw, and relational shift hold cleanly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s interiority is lyrical and consistent, with embodied emotion (“the cold knives my lungs”) and micro-choices (climbing, tracing circles) that align with the maestro-of-memory goal. Internal contradiction is present—homesickness vs. creative ambition—but remains summative rather than enacted in a single beat; the final renunciation is implied, not dramatized with visible cost. The shell-as-conductor’s-baton is a strong object-based motive, yet the character’s flaws and limits are more declared than tested under pressure. Still, the voice is idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not stereotypic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lio’s interiority is concrete—his “habit of resisting” gravity is a lived tic, the tablet’s warmth against his palm is a pulse. Contradictory impulses coil in-scene: he both clings to the reset-loop and longs to “fall for once,” enacted when he finally lets gravity adopt him. The final renunciation—walking home under “quiet arches like everyone else”—pays the accumulated cost of eternal return. The only hairline slip is occasional lyric shorthand (“my faces taught themselves to contradict”) that leans summary amid embodied beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lena’s interiority is embodied and specific—she ‘hears with bones’ and ‘reads the drum as braille river’. The broken-needle-as-guilt is a nice concrete proxy, but her shift from numbness to pulse is more asserted than dramatized: we are told her chest answers, yet no contradictory impulse or visible cost is staged. The micro-choice to press play is present, but the final beat is summary (‘she felt a depth ring’) rather than a renunciation or risk that forecloses anything. Relationships stay off-stage, so the crucible test is waived; still, the arc feels slightly under-cooked for publish-now caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-recorder’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—every metaphor is a tool for mapping wind, fences, silence. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs wary self-protection) play out in micro-choices: accepting the pigeon, deciding to “stand where wind shifts,” writing raindrops aloud. The final renunciation—keeping the report unowned—has been pre-paid by the tube, the hair, the woman’s rain-oath; cost is visible in the promise to an empty bench. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; perception stays biased, professional, and physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The broker’s caution, embodied handling of the vial, and final decision to open it show a credible arc from restraint to exposure; the tremor and “door swing behind my cheekbones” make grief bodily. Interior contradiction is present but stays largely abstract (“I had come to understand…”) rather than enacted in mid-scene beats. No secondary character pressures him, so status dynamics are N/A; Dr. Vale acts as facilitator, not opposing force. The choice to let the two scents meet costs him the buffered distance he clung to—earned stasis achieved—but motivation could be sharpened if aromatic caution visibly complicated an earlier tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The poet’s yearning to “discover the texture of time” and his tender stewardship of the rope anchor interior contradiction and embodied emotion; the rope’s twin memories (flight v. betrayal) braid through micro-choices, and the final refusal to relinquish the mapped knots costs him his visual compass while gifting the escapee release—a renunciation that is credibly earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is lyrically particular (“She bows near the bridge so the violin scratches out stars, then backs away to offer milk”), her contradictory desire to perfect the imperfect is embodied in micro-moves under rising pressure, and the final renunciation of flawless sound costs her the safe silence she once cherished. The boy and diver remain functional types rather than full secondary crucibles, but her solo arc satisfies single-POV scope. No label-speak; embodied emotion carries every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator's "affectionate detachment" is lived in every beat: gloved hands on electrodes, static prickling as diagnostic tool. Interior contradiction—peddling counterfeit feeling while refusing to drown in it—drives every micro-choice. The final ledger press of the petal is earned renunciation with visible cost: he gives away the last scent of connection and stays “uncarved.” Only the brief “therapy-speak” glint in “caring that stands a step back” keeps this shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Broker's dual impulse—ledger precision vs. quiet gratitude—surfaces in micro-choices (ferrying cards, counting cranes). Interiority stays maritime-specific; no therapy-speak. Final endurance of "whispers" over shouts is earned via the因果链 of shared cocoa/locket. Cost is felt: he forecloses public acclaim for invisible labor, and that renunciation lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The illustrator’s obsession with “echo anatomy” is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (rubbing the pendant, lifting the forbidden sluice) flows from a believable professional curiosity laced with guilt. Interior contradiction peaks when the city tilts under the giant’s snore—fear and wonder coexist in one trembling hand. The only bar to 9.0 is that the final renunciation (“I let the echo go”) is stated more than dramatized; we feel relief but not the precise cost to the narrator’s self-image or future practice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority shines—"I must dovetail grief with practice" crystallizes a believable contradiction. The conjurer’s choices (humming, tracing, packing) grow from a single motive and carry visible cost. Missing only a hairline: no second character on-page to test status shifts, so the full crucible bullet is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crawl-space narrator’s interiority is rendered through concrete, embodied sense-memory beats that double as micro-choices (crawling, cupping the tape in the cheek). The “visible offering” motive crystallizes in the deliberate atlas-cache & silver-hair booby-trap; the final step forward costs anonymity and risks expulsion, paying a felt price. Relationship with Mara stays off-page, but her presence supplies adequate external pressure; no stock labels or therapy-speak mar the voice. Contradictory impulses—“shy architecture” vs. need to be seen—stay live inside every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s shift from control-freak ledger-man to “circuitously sincere” listener is embodied in micro-choices—widening swales, letting moss stay, writing a “plan that was more like a prayer.” Interior contradiction is vivid: the itch under the glove of routine, the wince still coming when a gust hits. Cost is legible—loss of certainty, of customers, of father’s brace-and-nail gospel—yet the arc stays slightly interior; Theo’s pressure is present but diluted because he never physically threatens or competes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s hunger to “thresh meaning from experience” is embodied in every micro-choice: turning the brooch, following rain trails, painting the braid. Interior contradiction flickers when the cold line “pointed inland” yet he obeys, showing obsession overriding unease. The final acceptance of the brooch-back from Mara crystallizes a credible renunciation of payment, earning the stasis of gratitude. No diagnostic speak; the insomnia surfaces only as “awake when the pumps sighed,” keeping embodiment primary.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The clairvoyant narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“quartz laugh,” “room we carry inside”), but the pilgrim remains a luminous cipher; because the pilgrim’s choices drive the climax (nodding the shadow into the vowel), the narrator’s passivity in that moment slightly undercuts the earned cost. Still, the contradiction of a seer who misses his own fate is dramatized, not declared, and the final humility feels legible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archivist’s reactively visionary trait is shown through tactile micro-choices—fitting the valve, pacing the dais steps—so interiority stays embodied rather than diagnostic. The “staggered intervals” method externalizes his hierarchy of values: listening over proclaiming, pausing over prescribing. A credible renunciation occurs when he refuses to blow the trumpet himself, letting the boy lift it; this costs him the heroic role and seals his identity as listener. Secondary pressure is thin—only the boy and father appear—so the crucible never widens, but the single-point focus is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mapper’s interiority is vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses ripple under every chalk stroke. Micro-choices (lowering the punch, stamping the blank ticket) carry visible cost and foreclose retreat. The final renunciation—truths as travelers, not prisoners—earns its ache through the litany of personal admissions. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; even “trembling certainty” is lived, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is vivid (“sympathetic skeptic who doubts the stagecraft but still holds the actor’s hand”) and embodied emotion arrives in surf-metaphors for laughter and whale-breath percussion. The narrator’s contradictory impulse—give up the solitary-logic memory at the end—lands with cost, yet the renunciation is slightly under-causal: we are told the tile “asked” for the memory rather than shown a micro-choice that hands it over. Micro-choices (chalking numbers, placing winter memory in left square) do reveal hierarchy of values, but the final surrender feels more orchestrated by the tower than actively seized. Still, flaws stay minor; the arc of generous self-revision feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    The immortal’s boredom and search for post-goodbye meaning give interior motive, but his decisive act—shifting the curse to Mara—reads as convenience rather than earned growth; contradictions are stated (“bored yet patient”) yet not dramatized under pressure. Mara’s courier façade offers secondary pressure, but her secrecy is asserted, never tested, so the relationship crucible remains theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s paradox—con artist’s honest child—drives every micro-choice; the ink-tallying beat embodies the contradiction under lethal pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“black mouth reflecting a face that refused to lie”) and degrades plausibly when sirens shrink perception to wheel-groove and drip-count. The final swap—breath for truth—pays off the established ledger obsession with visible social cost. Only a hairline slip: “patience with knuckles” nears label-speak yet is saved by embodied context.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s vocation as “gilded-leaf stationer” is interiorized as a calling to salvage lost time; every micro-choice—counting breaths, whispering to bark, binding pages—springs from this single, stubborn motive. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between archival hunger and the knowledge that these “invented histories” are only courteous guests; the cost is the ever-thinning battery and the unspoken certainty that no one may ever read them. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status tests are waived; the solitary crucible is credible and particular. The final renunciation—continue cataloguing for the bonsai, not for future footsteps—earns its stoic ache through accreted gesture, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The survivor’s compulsive listening and cartography of rumor are concrete, embodied choices under pressure; the final shared silence with the woman shows earned stasis. Interiority stays sensory—“cold arrangement of causes in my throat”—never abstract. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are waived. The flaws (namelessness, compulsive collection) directly shape the closing choice to teach listening, paying the cost of perpetual ghosthood.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The myth-buster’s interiority is vivid—contradictory impulses (solve vs. listen) coexist in the same beats. The final apology is earned: earlier silence is embodied as “tide rip,” then paid for aloud. Cost is felt: the dome sheds chalk “snow,” the cello warms, the past is altered “just enough to forgive.” No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; single-POV depth meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s “dual allegiance” is dramatized in the micro-choice of handing the stone chip to both Yano and Miri; the embodied tension between guild order and council dignity is palpable. Interiority stays concrete—“the cold that built us”—rather than abstract labels. The final act of tucking the chip under the tongue turns memory into a bodily cost, earning the pivot. Voice remains singular, no head-hop, and the flaw—slightly over-eloquent diction under peak stress—is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The interiority is rich—“silence still has something to say to me”—and the mentor memory seeds a believable micro-choice: the single shutter click renouncing repeatability. Yet the trait “purposefully curious” is only labeled, never tested by a competing impulse; the blue message is received, not wrestled with. Still, the renunciation costs him the chance to keep shooting, so the arc earns its quiet stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s blindness is never used as gimmick; every micro-choice—touching the drone’s thorax, tuning bowls by ear, translating pings into yard-hand choreography—springs from the same constraint and costs her real time and calm. The interior contradiction between her need for control and the limits of auditory data peaks when the anchor lifts: she stands still while the world moves, a renunciation that feels earned. Jaro’s presence is light but sufficient to show status flux: he fetches, watches, reports, becoming her eyes without sermonizing. No diagnostic labels, no tidy emotional arithmetic—just a woman whose flaw becomes the engine of everyone’s salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s dry-witted composure stays consistent: every micro-choice—rotating the compass, scraping the ice, breathing on the glass—grows from the obsession with “where the rivers begin.” The final kneel and canteen-drop is the earned cost of that obsession; no interiority slips into label-speak. The lone flaw is the off-stage “bargain with the stillness,” a motive never dramatized, but it doesn’t derail the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bell tuner’s lucid silence and patient guidance create a magnetic, mythic presence; his refusal to name himself and insistence on communal rhythm over speech embody earned mystique. The narrator’s interiority stays concrete (“I swear I saw the stones listen”), but the pair’s relationship is more ritual than crucible—no status clash or mutual change—so the emotional cost lands softly. The boy’s micro-correction is the only visible flaw-to-mercy arc; the rest is collective, diluting individual contradiction. Still, the tuner’s calm authority and the narrator’s final vow of stewardship feel credible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The diver’s contradictory urges—ascend vs. stay, panic vs. surrender—are rendered in embodied micro-choices (stilling the fins, letting the sea “adopt” the body). The mother-memory operates as a living spur, not backstory filler, and the final renunciation (turning down O₂ to keep the bridge unbroken) carries an unflinching, on-page cost. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, hush and salt braid thought. Only the slightest hedge keeps this from 9+: the vial’s later handling is more symbol than fresh choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s filial identity (“cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son”) is more label than lived contradiction; interiority is vivid but stays lyrically assertive (“I choose a new inheritance”) rather than dramatized under duress. Micro-choices (lattice placement, beam-holding) are present yet register as ritualized stance rather than escalating trade-off. Closure cost is poetic but felt more as tonal resolve than character-specific loss, keeping motivation strong but not quite irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    The weaver’s grief-stitching and willingness to “hear how openings sing when edges split” give a concrete, idiosyncratic interiority; the final act of pressing the plate into the stone book shows a micro-choice that costs visibility and safety, earning a quiet renunciation rather than tidy triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrical and concrete (“ships that finally arrived”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the single micro-choice—reassembling the dial—carries weight yet feels pre-ordained, blunting cost. The “warmly curious” trait is shown only in summary, not under pressure. Still, the embodied emotion (“tasted like a door opening slowly”) is vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pseudonym creator’s interiority is vivid—“tired grin like a night lake,” the tactile love of margins—and micro-choices (kneeling to recode chalk, folding the letter) reveal hierarchy of values. Yet the decisive moment—the promise to the edges—lands as gentle stasis rather than a visible renunciation that costs him something concrete; the cost is all Mira’s. Still, the mentor recursion (Oona’s arrows) gives credible continuity to his flaw/struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tamsin’s interior contradiction—sharp listener who performs clownishness—shows in every micro-beat (bending candle-flame while laughing off Rauk). Her motives stay legible, but the text over-relies on abstract interior summary (“she understood she was unraveling conspiracies”) instead of embodied irrationality during peak beats. No real relationship crucible is dramatized on page; Rauk is only a foil name. Endurance costs are present yet generalized, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrator’s hunger to “find the moment before deciding” is viscerally embodied through the splinter-in-palm pain that steadies the choice to stay; contradictory impulses (urge to flee, need to mend) coexist in the same breath. Interiority never abstracts into therapy-speak; the apology materializes as fogged glass and root-curl fingers, not slogans. Micro-choice at the hospital door forks the timeline with visible cost—the cigarette never lit, the brother’s fingers curling “like roots” re-knot their bond. Earned stasis feels inevitable yet painful: the letter is left behind, no longer needed because the unspoken apology has already been lived.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The translator’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—coral ridges as memory, scarf as tourniquet—each micro-choice (photographing then folding phrases) reveals a hierarchy of values. Sifa stays mostly asleep, so relationship pressure is off-loaded onto the waiting triangle; the narrator’s grafted consent still carries visible cost when the coral’s map is recognized. No therapy-speak, only embodied ache; the refusal to speak “everything” is an earned renunciation that forecloses heroic transparency. Character voice never flattens into archetype; the occupational lens filters every noticed detail.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Interiority is gorgeously embodied and idiosyncratic—"heart light, shoes muddied with someone's happy yesterday." Micro-choices (threading film, baiting roots with marmalade) spring from a coherent, evolving motive to gift rather than hoard joy. The final renunciation—leaving the fresco under the roots, rewinding the reel—pays the cost visibly and crystallizes the arc. No contradictions, no label-speak; pressure bends her but never flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The restorer’s listening-before-touching ethos, coin-as-lens ritual, and minute console adjustments create a believable, vocation-driven interiority. Micro-choices—clap, nickel tilt, varnish wave—manifest the “methodically playful” trait under pressure. The only flaw is a slight over-summary of emotional upshift inside the mural; embodied cost is hinted but not fully tasted, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collective “we” generates vivid interior contradiction—Ilya’s cryptic charisma collides with the narrator’s tax-bill dread—yet personal stakes blur behind group voice. Micro-choices (annotating the Notice in soil, shaking the rattle seed) are concrete and costly. A stronger solo interior pulse at the climax would sharpen the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.7)
    The insomniac poet’s motive—turning pain into beauty—remains lyrically present yet abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice visibly risks that motive under pressure. Interiority is lush, but the final concession (“I practice sleeping without closing”) feels too gentle; the cost of armistice lands on blossoms, not on the speaker’s body or identity. The voice is singular, but the lack of status shift or relational crucible keeps the arc internal and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s contradictory impulses—methodical duty vs. the ache of foxglove regret—pulse in every micro-choice; her refusal to seal the crack, though it costs her perfect order, is earned by the teacher’s earlier warning and the on-page tremor that follows Aristea’s blooming.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator’s vanishing and return are motivated, the contradiction between scholarly retreat and relational need is embodied in the glass ink well, and the final “we” grammar is earned. Interiority is concrete (“scholarship of retreat”), flaws complicate choices, and the cost of silence is visceral. Yet the epiphany—“language of we is a grammar I will not lose again”—leans toward articulate summary rather than raw embodied contradiction, keeping it just below the 8.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The machinist’s interior contradiction—trembling yet tightening grip—embodies the “encrypted compassion” concept; embodied emotion and micro-choice under pressure satisfy the 9+ quick test. Mentor’s resin-code and the chain’s re-weighting give visible cost, though the valley council remains a faceless chorus, muting status dynamics. Voice stays coherent, singular, and tool-competent without safety-hedging. No overt diagnostic labels; the tremor is physical, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The trainer’s grief for Mara and his refusal to trust again are embodied in the micro-choice of steadying the capsule with the meteorite—an action that shows both risk and cost. The contradictory impulse to refuse yet help Ezra plays in scene, not summary. The final willingness to keep the “ledger of safe returns” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the interior tag “I wanted to refuse” edges toward label-speak before the attic “asked me otherwise.”

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning to understand the father yet resisting premature crossing—are rendered through embodied micro-choices (holding the logbook to the light, breathing until pulse steadies). The final renunciation of closing the cedar frame earns its cost because the prior beats have made “necessary distance” a lived constraint. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Cap enforced: closure choice is earned, but the single-POV reflection mode keeps relational crucible off-stage, so 9+ gate not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Interiority is lyrically embodied—e.g. “my racing maps”—but the narrator’s want (belonging) never collides with an opposing internal fear or flaw; the single micro-choice is the synchronized exhale, which is lovely yet costs nothing and changes nothing. Mara exists mainly as gentle chorus, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Result: character is vivid but static; no contradictory impulse under pressure, hence no earned stasis or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s vocation and interior logic are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction that blurs micro-choice; the promise to “keep the cave safe” lands as gentle epiphany rather than renunciation with cost. Emotional embodiment is strong in early beats (“my hands carried a disk…”) yet flattens in the final third into ambient narration. Still, the voice stays character-specific and the occupation drives every action, satisfying the 9- gate for contradiction-in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The analytical street performer’s interiority is vivid—his chalk-grid logic, pouch inventory, and diagonal worldview feel idiosyncratic and consistent. Embodied emotion is strong: the way he “weighs its diagonal promises” or “catches murmurs the way tidepools catch starlight” shows perception under pressure. Micro-choices (tossing ribbon, pivoting bishop) map to his trait and advance causality. The only drag is the woman’s thinner texture; her “quiet superstition” is still told more than dramatized, so the relational crucible never fully ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tide-dancer’s exile-from-within is viscerally embodied—brine swallowed, soles mapping gravel—so the interior contradiction between obedience to decree and allegiance to bone-tides is alive in every micro-step. The moment he offers his own wrist as “draft” before inscribing the clerk’s palm, the hierarchy of values (art > safety > certainty) is made explicit with visible cost. No stock labels; the body thinks in sway and starlight. The only drag is the clerk’s conversion, which feels slightly teleporting given how little prior status friction we see on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glazier’s quiet stubbornness—“my motive is simple and stubborn”—is repeatedly dramatized (choosing to let the atrium “show itself,” tipping light onto the ledger). Interiority stays concrete, never ventriloquizing non-POV minds. No visible cost is extracted from him, however; he risks neither social nor material loss, so the arc leans observation more than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The firefighter’s guilt-driven quest lands cleanly: his choice to save subdivisions over owls is dramatized early and the cracked box keeps that wound tactile. Interiority is concrete—“tasting salt,” “smoke etched into his pores”—and the final handshake with Mira crystallizes a believable renunciation. The only drag is a trace of therapeutic summary—“he wanted to translate pain into a universal language”—that momentarily abstracts the embodied stake.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s lucid dreamer identity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—knotting cord, relighting a stranger’s balloon—rather than labels. Interior contradiction is present: scientific detachment vs. longing for communal repair. The final mirror moment converts the self into a variable, earning the conceptual cost of inclusion. Still, the emotional crescendo is slightly under-cooked; a single trembling breath or salt-stung palm could have sealed the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“bone carefulness,” sleeve-tucking ritual); the protagonist’s contradictory allegiance to both exactitude and mercy peaks when he re-charts the man’s knocking into a lull. Micro-choices (placing film strip to mantel, whispering a name) visibly tilt present stance. Cost is felt: accepting the drowned stranger dissolves grandmother’s ruthless legacy, foreclosing pure cartographer detachment. Voice remains coherent; no headcount issues.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    The painter’s interior contradiction—trading another’s heartbeat to keep their own honesty—shows simultaneously in the locket’s ticking and the refusal to promise Lio certitude. Their calm is never placid; it trembles in the wrist-tilt that bends light into the mirror-door and in the whispered admission “a possibility, not a promise.” Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: they kneel to the child, yield the locket, then withdraw, paying with permanent exposure of their method. The borrowed pulse’s cost is dramatized, not labeled, and the renunciation of full control satisfies Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist’s contradictory impulses (negotiator vs. lifelong guilt) act simultaneously in-scene; the reed vow physically embodies a cost that forecloses speech if peace ruptures. Interiority stays concrete (“I take names on the clipboard and let the ink dry slow, so every letter remembers its weight”). Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: silence > reputation > future children. Final endurance is earned by prior causality and leaves visible cost (leaving the clipboard behind). Hairline slip: “operative gentleness” asserted more than dramatized in a second beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The amoral-philanthropist / secretly-sentimental contradiction is lived in-scene: every micro-choice—demanding the engines stay off, cradling the egg, whispering lost names—lets us watch the conflicted impulse spark. Interiority is concrete (“I belonged to it”) and embodied in the tremor of a hatchling against palm. The final narrowing of the water release is an earned renunciation that carries visible cost on ledger and conscience. Voice stays singular, no head-hop; status pressure is off-page (directors on ridge) yet shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lira’s abstinence is not a label but a honed instrument: the refusal of desire becomes the blade that can cut the city’s lullaby. Every micro-choice—barefoot steps, breath-as-metronome, unpinning hair—springs from the vow and visibly costs her body heat, balance, pulse-thinning. The braid she unweaves is her own chastity turned weapon; the cost is the city’s tremor that rattles her ankles. Interior contradiction (yearn to touch / must not) stays live in scene, no diagnostic talk—just frost-burned soles and the audible thinning of heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aurel’s calm exterior vs. the “hive of second thoughts” gives a credible fault-line; the apology without poetry and the decision to cede the stick to the audience show a micro-choice that costs him control. The interior contradiction is concrete, but the troupe partners remain slightly sketched—Miri’s nod and Ferro’s neck-scratch are the only embodied tells—so the relational crucible never fully ignites under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete—choices like tilting the triangle to “spill a current” show embodied motive. The renunciation of monument-building for accompaniment is earned, yet the internal contradiction (esoteric realist vs. caretaker) stays announced rather than dramatized in a single beat, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is sensorily rich (“breath sparking like tin shavings”), motives stay tethered to the tactile act of casting; the final endurance to stay and keep the bellows awake is earned by the braiding beat and carries visible cost in the scar-turned-lodestar image. The “technically gentle” trait surfaces only once, never tested again, so the full micro-choice hierarchy isn’t fully dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich—“lattice of images and scents,” “laughter steadied my hands”—and the final barefoot step into mud is an embodied micro-choice that earns the name-shed. Yet the only visible contradiction is between fear of being discarded and the emergent urge to invite others; we do not see simultaneous impulses collide in a single beat. Motive is clear and tightens, but the arc leans contemplative rather than genuinely flawed or mistake-ridden. Voice remains idiosyncratic enough to feel individual, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The astronomer’s interiority—his “empirically ironic faith” and ledger-like attention—drives every micro-choice; the tile-alignment and ash-mirror beats externalize his contradictory hunger for measurable transcendence. Cost is legible when he accepts reduction to “curves and sums” in the mirrored night; the vow to keep darkness from being double-paid seals a visible renunciation. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk; instead, body, basket, and bronze eyelid embody thought. Frugality as spiritual economy feels lived, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s shift from siege-general to soundless surrender is credibly seeded through embodied micro-choices (pulse under thumb, silent laugh against sternum). The narrator’s pacifist schemer trait stays active—every beat is a calculated tactic—yet the interior contradiction (using war’s own logic to end war) is left stated, not dramatized in gesture. Closure cost is felt—“resentment stepped back, almost relieved”—but the narrator’s own cellular memory is told once and never retested, blunting the symmetry of shared transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Iren’s grief-anchored patience and methodical micro-choices (counting mummified apples, unscrewing the sextant index) keep him credibly grounded; the interior contradiction between trapping and freeing the dream is embodied in breath-by-breath action. The final renunciation—letting the dream run yet belong—pays off the wife-loss motive with visible cost: the broken sextant now points only to warmth, foreclosing any future personal use. No head-count issues; choreography stays clean. Hairline slip: “needed truth more than polished show” edges toward label-speak, but is immediately dramatized by the cracked mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quartz-eye mender’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“a shard sits where my left eye once looked”—and every micro-choice (kissing the ribbon, handing the receipt-map) grows from the same wound-plus-wonder contradiction. The kids function as live pressure, forcing the mender to externalize the deciduous-vow philosophy; bandaged-knee kid’s whispered “promises get heavy” is a perfect status shift. The only flaw is a trace of self-diagnosis in “I said my mistakes, which is a school…” that edges toward label-speak; still, the final renunciation of wages for listening carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    The curator’s interiority is lucid and idiosyncratic—“brightened disquiet,” “gauze and worry”—and every micro-choice (pressing the shell to the page, refusing the named fruit, slipping the seed behind the mirror) is both motive-true and irreversible. Contradictory impulses—yearning for knowledge yet wary of cost—cohere in scene rather than summary. The final refusal/endurance is earned because the orchard first showed him what inheriting *would* take. No label-speak; even the “ledger” image is embodied through the ancestor’s bent body.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “stubborn as a spine” motive stays tactile through micro-choices—trading petal-grammar, knotting checkout-thread, refusing to abandon the traveler—so the arc of cautious resourcefulness earns its final forfeiture of forgetting. Interiority remains embodied (palms ache “like a chord never struck”) without diagnostic labels. The only flaw: the traveler's interior is summarized rather than shown, blunting the crucible potential of their shared beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The twin-self is dramatized through embodied choices—pressing the card, speaking names aloud, accepting the automaton’s bargain—so interiority stays concrete. The final renunciation (leaving the ship with pockets of seeds) costs the forever-drift and is earned by the mirrored double stepping out; the contradiction between “trapped” and “freedom” is held in the body, not abstracted. Micro-choices (hand-steadied grammar, winding the barker) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Voice specificity wobbles once: “diagnostic label-speak” sneaks in with “unkindled solace,” a coined abstraction that momentarily blurs embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied—"I warmed my hands and my thoughts"—and the archivist’s methodical nature visibly shapes micro-choices (tracing braid, pulse-check). The final renunciation of apology feels earned because earlier beats show the same temperament choosing conversation over force. A trace more contradiction in-scene would nudge it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete, embodied in tactile ritual (pressing stone to ice, tasting metal and snow). Contradictory impulses—fear of erasure vs longing to guide—coexist in-scene and drive the final pact. The earned renunciation of sole guardianship carries visible cost: the cave “maps us” and the storms bow, foreclosing solitary mastery. Voice remains singular, never drifting into therapeutic self-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kera’s interiority is sensorially concrete—palms to trembling panes, exhaled rhythm matching remembered engine—and her retrocognitive curse enables micro-choices that alter beam angles. Flaws (obsessive pattern-seeking) complicate, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forecloses personal retreat by calling strangers home, rope-toughening her thistle hope. Motive progression is causally tracked; no diagnostic label-speak. Voice stays distinct; no headcount penalty since choreography remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archivist’s motivation—sculpting identity from collective memory—remains coherent and embodied through tactile micro-choices (warm sap nib, palm on stone). Pre-emptive nostalgia is dramatized as a tool that forces gentleness under pressure, not merely labelled. No interior contradiction is staged inside a single beat, so the highest band is missed, but the flaw>tool conversion is credibly lived.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s interiority is lyrically concrete—his boots “mapped the cobbles like patient drumsticks,” filtering fear into breath. The contradictions are present but worked mostly in summary: “smiling not to mock sorrow but to persuade it into a chair” tells us the tactic rather than dramatizes the tussle. Micro-choices under pressure—altering trajectories when the gust hits—are rendered through ambient sensing; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, so renunciation feels light. Still, the voice-driven embodiment and occupational specificity lift him well above template.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Interior contradiction is present—“I do not choose tonight, but I agree to cross…”—yet the tidal-pool chronicler’s observing stance dominates; action remains largely descriptive rather than choice-driven until the final deferral, so the change feels more spoken than dramatized. Micro-choices are filtered through metaphor; body and shell hinge are vivid but stay imagistic, limiting felt cost. Warmly observant trait is repeatedly asserted rather than tested under pressure. Voice is consistent and specific, but agency is diluted by lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interiority is lush, sensorial, and embodied; the narrator’s fear-of-enclosure vs hunger-for-sky is dramatized in every sip of silence. Micro-choices—how wide the doll’s mouth is held, which silence is tasted first—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final descent converts the ladder from “spine of jail bars” to “rib cage widening,” a credible, earned shift in stance. Flaw: the father remains off-stage, so the filial crucible is only half-lit; still, the self-vs-bunker tension is sharp enough to satisfy the 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    The operator’s interiority is granular and embodied—his “mind learned the art of being fluidly logical” is shown through micro-choices like dimming the fare light or adjusting swing to meet wind. Contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. parental tenderness) coexist in the same beats, and the final renunciation—lingering adrift to honor the hush—carries visible cost in lost revenue and emotional exposure. The bell-counting moment crystallizes a hierarchy of values without sentimentality; the child’s pocketed bell is the earned proof of comfort delivered. No diagnostic self-talk; every reaction is filtered through tactile gauges, vial, and wind.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Maris’s interior contradiction—archivist obedience vs. familial defiance—drives every beat; the moment she bows her knees to the root-room the cost of stewardship is bodily enacted. Emotion is never labeled, always sensorily embodied (“chest hurt with the nostalgia of a frontier”). The final palm-to-radio gesture is the inevitable culmination of her earlier micro-choices with the flake and drone; renunciation of sovereignty is earned and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Keeper’s motives—“burn bridges carefully,” “teach suffocating to breathe”—drive every beat; the interior contradiction between caretaker and arsonist is alive in the gift of the ring. Micro-choices (handing over ring, counting breaths) embody hierarchy of values. The visitor’s tremor and eventual un-clasped hand show credible, embodied change. Cost is visible: Keeper remains alone in ash, lanterns held for strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The survivor’s “stubborn gratitude” and vow to survive without crushing others is embodied through tactile micro-choices—gripping the submarine bolt between teeth, whispering to mushrooms, trading the diamond bead for workers’ debt relief. Interior contradiction (ex-huckster now wary of selling hope) is dramatized, not labeled, and the final act of paying the foreman with a “grin and a lesson” crystallizes a visible cost: personal safety traded for collective moral capital. The only minor drag is a brief therapeutic cadence in “I aim to be virtuously mischievous now,” but it is quickly grounded by the physical ordeal inside the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The protagonist’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradiction between inherited guilt and reluctant agency is embodied in the micro-choice to wind the gramophone. The final renunciation—“my task was not to reign, but to keep listening”—is earned by the causal chain of revelations and carries visible cost in the abdication and exile of identity. Flaws (dynasty-ender label, inherited noose) actively complicate choices rather than serving as ornamental backstory. Only the grandmother’s motives remain slightly abstract, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    The knight’s quiet pledge to “tend what may be” is the only decisive micro-choice, but it is telegraphed early and never tested by a second, higher-stakes beat; the interiority is lyrical rather than contradictory, so the arc feels like a single, elongated breath rather than a compounding crucible. Still, the embodied emotion (“shivering bliss” versus “old wars”) is specific and the renunciation of armor carries visible cost, satisfying the Earned Stasis threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich, idiosyncratic, and embodied—archivist’s “broken-hearted” stance shows in micro-gestures (unfurling the brittle knot, holding brass under lamp). Contradictory impulses (rule-bound preservation vs tender intrusion) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in the costly choice to mail the button. The final renunciation—calling it “a return, weighted so it will not blow away”—pays off earlier causality and shows visible cost of violating policy. Minor slip: “tactfully hopeful” is named more than dramatized; still, the endured risk of job breach keeps the score in high band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jessa’s stubborn custodian ethos is vividly embodied—every tactile micro-choice (key twist, wire bridge, notebook scratch) is tethered to her vow. The interior contradiction between quiet perseverance and explosive sabotage stays alive in-scene; no tidy self-diagnosis. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and leaves the key to weather, a renunciation that stings. Missing 0.3 because the contact remains a passive parcel; his interiority could have sharpened the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The saxophonist’s choice to “whisper without tone” in the final beats crystallizes prior interior contradiction—need to save the town vs. need to keep his name—and costs him the applause he once craved. Embodied emotion is sustained: “fog nests inside my chest…subtle feathers.” Backstory confession (“I wanted applause, a shine”) exactly primes the renunciation. One-axis flaw arc, but within 800 words the micro-choices earn the hush he dons.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fen’s interior contradiction—cataloguer vs. releaser—drives every beat; the moment he tips the drawers into wind, the cost (his life’s archive) is palpable. Embodied emotion stays moss-green and tactile, never drifting into label-speak. The renunciation feels inevitable because the micro-choices (thumbnail lens, tremor-listening) foreshadow surrender. One hairline slip: “like bark after fire” edges toward simile cliché, barely nicking perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—clinging to screws/springs while chasing the compass’s random tugs—ripples through embodied beats (testing each step “with a watchmaker’s patience and a pilgrim’s doubt”). Renouncing linear time is earned: fire destroys his shop, ashes deliver the sigil, failure of old tools forces the leap. Micro-choices under pressure (climbing the machine-ribs wet-handed, leaving the rose plugged in) visibly foreclose safe withdrawal. Cost is felt: he hands his livelihood to a water-clock that will never keep commercial hours.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s self-interrogation (“What if I misnamed her wildness…”) crystallizes a layered interior conflict that survives the page-count. Embodied regret is sustained through tactile metallurgy, never sliding into label-speak. The final resolve to “ask mercy in a tongue of seams” is earned: every prior beat alloys guilt with craft. A near-microscopic gap: we glimpse no contradictory impulse while the coin actually cools—one beat of stoic silence that could have bled contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The collector’s interior contradiction—modestly fearless, practiced at stillness—drives every micro-choice; the bargain to confess first enacts that trait with visible cost. Emotions stay embodied in tooth-on-gut-string and the colt-clumsy laugh, avoiding label-speak. The arc lands in earned stasis: he departs carrying a companionable ache that forecloses the old guilt-loop. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The survivor’s embodied trauma—breath “low double tap,” wrists trying “to twist apart”—is viscerally particular; the proprioceptive upgrade turns every joint into a lie-detector, forcing micro-choices (looped strap not tightened) that externalize mercy’s equation. Interiority stays sensorial, never diagnostic; the renunciation of the strap at the boundary tree costs the only tool he owns, earning stasis. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrator’s motive to "honor overlooked histories" is declared repeatedly but never tested by a contradictory impulse; no interior contradiction surfaces when the lens refracts the names. Emotion stays cerebral—"Memory becomes elusively tangible"—without embodied contradiction or visible cost to the speaker. The single micro-choice (unfastening the painted door) is presented as inevitable, not a hard-won renunciation, so the arc lands as observant rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    The technician’s calm, tactile competence stays credible; interiority is thin but consistent. No contradictory impulse is dramatized—he simply follows ghostly cues—so the final “lightness” feels asserted rather than paid for. Still, the embodied dust-analysis beat shows micro-choice under pressure and keeps the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The operator’s contradictory devotion to both perfect catalogues and reckless revision is dramatized in the press-choke moment; grief is embodied in the warm bottle and cracking pane, not summarized. A single micro-choice—loosening the press—earns the climax and carries visible cost in the orchard’s rupture. Interiority stays idiosyncratic (“folding ever since”) and avoids therapy-speak. The Glasswright’s status shift is legible behind her mirrored hands, adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Neris’s revolutionary past is more label than lived pressure; only late does “kneeling can be strategy” embody a micro-choice. The custodian role supplies clear status and embodied ritual (velvet over mirrors), but internal contradiction between rebel and judge stays verbal. Final “defunct heart considers revolt again” crystallizes a visible cost—an earned stasis—lifting the score. Still, earlier beats lean on epithet rather than tensioned action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The repairman’s “wilts near dishonesty” trait is vividly embodied early and drives his refusal to yield to the rust elders, giving his moral spine a physical corollary; the contradiction between reverence for their oath and his insistence on saving the children crystallizes under pressure. Micro-choices—naming tools aloud to steady courage, sewing patience into the hinge—are character-specific and visibly costly. The final bow to the elders shows earned change: he neither genuflects to dogma nor storms off in cheap triumph, but sets daylight on the floor like bread, foreclosing stealthy return to midnight. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk dilutes the harmonics.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The collector’s interiority is richly atmospheric—mood as motive—but micro-choices (knotting cord, pressing the needle) are few and late; the vow is the first clear fork with cost. Flaws: no contradictory impulse in-scene, no visible endurance/renunciation beyond “return with what must be kept,” so the arc hovers at strong-not-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lush, salt-steeped, and specific; the sculptor’s contradictions (restlessness vs. craft) live in every beat. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Micro-choice to angle lantern slide into arch is credible hinge, though cost is more atmospheric than tangible. Final stance of carrying the lesson forward reads as earned renunciation with visible salt-cold fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artist’s interior contradiction—painting to “speak without harm” while resisting overt display—remains embodied and particular; the final renunciation of permission-asking is earned through nights of withheld color and the felt cost of “spaces where the wall itself could breathe.” Micro-choices (aligning postcards, angling the lantern) track a hierarchy of values without declarative self-analysis. No second character appears, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only bar to 9+ is that the restraint never faces an external test that could have forced a costlier mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interiority is rich and embodied (“truth was a muscle and pain was how it learned to move”), her micro-choice to keep contradictions intact is earned, and Esteban’s pressure sharpens her values. One minor slip: the diary-spine touch triggers retrocognition without prior foreshadowing, a near-knowledge leap. The final stance of “parley with pain” lands as credible renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Still, the absence of any earlier hint of paranormal mechanism keeps her just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s refusal of melodrama and embrace of discipline lands as a credible renunciation; his interiority stays concrete (“he studies that flat pronouncement like an oath”). Micro-choices—cupping the bottle, chalking then erasing the plan—embody motive without label-speak. The arrival of the two women tests but does not alter his stance, so the cost feels more atmospheric than personal; a sharper sting would push past 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scribe’s contradictory drives—archival duty vs. self-exposure—are dramatized in the moment he writes his own name as witness; the embodied ritual with wax shaving, ink, and tree bark makes the interior split visceral. No diagnostic label-speak; instead, “the taste of a coin haunts a tongue” renders guilt sensory. The final micro-choice (writing the prophecy beside the split) costs him his protective anonymity, paying the prior causality in full.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The solitary seed-saver’s interiority stays concrete—tannin taste of the cap, frost-nap of wheat—while contradictory impulses (caretaker vs. usher of borrowed time) coil inside one body. Micro-choices—pressing wood to lips, crowning the hatchling—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation (letting the cap go) is causally earned and scales to the length. Voice never drifts into label-speak; emotion is shown through tactile ritual, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tester’s “credibly curious” nature is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—threading sensors into hemp, switching to whisper-alert, lowering leather mufflers—each action embodying the listening creed; the internal contradiction (duty to test vs. refusal to blast) is kept alive in scene, and the final renunciation costs him official credit, felt in the rope’s “unstartled sway.”

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The janitor’s interiority is textured and embodied—“the ache that opens when I sweep dust”—but the turn that converts salvage crew empathy into a reprieve feels slightly too tidy; the micro-choice to hand over the lantern glass works, yet the crew’s rapid moral shift lacks a visible cost that would make the stillness earned. Still, the character’s flaws and contradictions are legible, and the final endurance reads as a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—reclusive yet compelled to safeguard unspoken memory—remains lyrically present but thinly dramatized; only one micro-choice (cupping the box, sealing it) visibly alters tactics. The promise to “carry weight, not translate” crystallizes endurance with cost, yet the prior beats stay weighted on atmospheric perception rather than pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The borrowed-time timekeeper's interiority is concrete and embodied (“my ribs answered with a hopeful ache,” “borrowed heartbeats lining my ribs like foreign coins”), but the arc is more accumulative than causal; the final renunciation feels slightly abstract because the earlier ‘debt’ is poetic rather than dramatized as a concrete threat or toll.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s interior contradiction—wanting to mend beauty yet embracing breakage—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to pluck the snapped string and gift the feather shows values in action. Status shift with the father (apology → gratitude) is legible, but the boy’s agency is mostly reactive; the final cost is felt more by the kite than by the speaker, so the renunciation is slightly under-weighted for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—meticulous “gently systematic” records against terminal recklessness—charges every micro-choice; the six-month deadline converts diary wire and root into stakes-laden sacraments. Interiority is concrete, body-bound (“lungs whistled like reed flutes”), never label-speak; renunciation of legacy for interspecies pact is causally earned and paid with felt breath-cost on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The luminous-skeptic narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“I doubted every triumphant headline yet refused the dark”), but the envoys remain atmospheric silhouettes; their only visible choice is the final filament-through-bell gesture. The protagonist’s academically rebellious trait is asserted rather than dramatized in a costly micro-choice, so the arc stays lyrically resonant rather than causally earned. Still, the contradiction between empirical rigor and pilgrimage-ritual is held in charged poise at the bell tower, supplying an Earned Stasis closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is dense, idiosyncratic, and embodied—every beat is filtered through the coachman’s salt-cracked perception. The contradictory pull between mourning and cultivation is held in-scene, not summarized. Micro-choices (where to crush coral, which tongue to speak) visibly fork the planting, and the final offer of a pod to the veteran clinches an earned renunciation with cost. No diagnostic label-speak; all emotion is visceral gear-shift and pollen.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is concrete and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. hope, staying vs. leaving—collide in the amber-lit cylinder scene. Gable’s “tail thumping like a metronome for the buried” externalizes emotion without label-speak. The final act of listening-as-bridge is earned by prior causality (leaf, riddles, river) and carries visible communal cost. Micro-choices (copying letters onto tin, turning the spindle counter-wind) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lone narrator’s interiority is rich and embodied—her refusal to evacuate, her tactile use of the compass rose, her temporal double-vision all crystallize a coherent, flawed self. The final choice to re-aim the lens at bedrock and sign with her mother’s name is earned by the family science ethic seeded early. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the micro-turn feels lightly rather than fiercely motivated, keeping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kestrel’s “sacredly playful” thief is vivid through gesture (kissing secrets mid-air, bowing to a clock), but the apprentice’s fear-to-wonder shift is asserted more than embodied; the final pledge lands because the spire’s cost is felt, yet interior contradiction could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and specific—“wrist still wore the faint ladder of scars where a tourniquet had bit,” “learning tasted like salt on a glass.” Contradictory impulses—performing versus surviving, recording versus forgetting—co-exist in scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of comfortable scripts when the red cord is coiled and set aside. The Custodian functions as secondary pressure, her benevolent ruthlessness pruning flourishes with clipped breaths, forcing micro-choices that visibly cost the narrator’s performative impulse. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts perpetual migratory duty, foreclosing personal stasis; cost is legible in the nod that is both sentence and pardon.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and embodied—grief is “teeth” that chew through sleep—but the seer is a prophetic cipher rather than a second character under pressure; the only crucible is the self. Micro-choices (offering the key, surrendering a counted breath) trace a believable arc from exile to earned belonging. No contradiction or label-speak; the flaw is the seer’s opacity, which keeps relationship/status bullets from activating.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tutor’s self-forgiveness arc is embodied through knot-tying micro-choices; the contradiction between teaching sacrifice and needing mercy is kept alive in scene. Final wrist-knot carries visible cost, earning the turn. Interiority stays concrete, but the prince remains off-stage, slightly blurring the relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The artist’s defiance is viscerally embodied in paint-stained hands and raw-throated poetry; the contradiction between grief-driven mischief and communal responsibility is dramatized in the open-air “trapdoor” rhymes. Interiority stays concrete—no abstract therapy-speak—and the final public stand is earned by nightly micro-choices that foreclose silence. The only cap is the Orientation debt applied at Q2, which caps Q1 at 8.3; the actual characterization exceeds that ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.7)
    The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—clutching mask vs. stylus, doubting yet diving—are enacted in scene, not summarized. His micro-choice to liquefy the charm (memento of identity) into the engine’s crack dramatizes the “kintsugi” self-repair and pays the story’s only tangible cost. Interiority stays concrete, sensorily anchored to limefat, vitriol, salt-phantom. The final Earned Stasis (engine breathes, he exhales) is credible because every prior beat has forced him to wager identity against function.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The painter’s “intimately aloof” contradiction is embodied in every beat—he touches surfaces, not people, and the final renunciation (leaving the canvas to the tide) grows logically from this trait. Interiority stays concrete and salt-stained; no therapeutic self-diagnosis. The only drag is that the stranger apparition is accepted without any tremor of fear or doubt, a micro-slip in credible emotional response under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The keeper’s quiet, scent-guided agency is consistent and embodied; the refusal to use the horn crystallizes his interior contradiction. Mara’s off-stage absence still bends every micro-choice, so the relationship functions as crucible. The final whispered welcome carries visible cost—his voice breaks, Alder’s hand finds his shoulder—earning the Earned Stasis. Interiority stays concrete, though a few lyric abstractions (“structure of longing”) flirt with label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The navigator’s contradictory impulse—clinging to a relic while guiding others away from their own ruins—stays live in every beat; the censer-foot choice to counterweight the dish crystallizes identity and costs him bodily (hands, shoulders, sleep). Interiority is sensorily anchored (“press the censer foot into my palm until the skin remembers”). The final earned stasis—head against bronze, patched by dawn—pays the accumulation without softening flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The forager’s rationality and involuntary truth-telling create a sharp, consistent interior contradiction that drives every beat; the final renunciation of the eye is earned because his logged “outcomes” make the cost of dependency legible. Micro-choices—burying the eye beneath the truffle bed, shaving truffles into oil—embody values without label-speak. Secondary characters sketch quickly but carry distinct griefs that pressure the circle. The only bar to 8+ is that the eye’s theft-origin remains a told, not dramatized, moral bruise.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The keeper’s contradictory trust in absence over presence is dramatized in every beat: he fondles the flower, adjusts the light to speak in silences, and accepts perpetual marginality. Interiority is embodied (“felt like snow on a bruise”) and complicates action; the final quiet vigil is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor flaw: the label “Old Partial” is told once rather than shown through gesture, but this is negligible against the sustained interior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elias’s “empirically intuitive” trait is dramatized—he tests footholds, smells limestone, trusts ants—rather than labeled. The sister-promise is the only interior driver, but it stays present via micro-choices (locking shop, sliding chip, helping neighbors). The final renunciation of “lonely” is earned because every beat shows solitude as habit, then active refusal. No contradictory impulses appear on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The queen’s interior contradiction—yearning to undo her own sovereignty yet still speaking in “softly commanding” velvet—is dramatized in scene, not told. Her final renunciation lands with palpable cost as metal meets stone and starlight pools into a mirror; the circlet drop is earned by the hawk-fire memory revealed minutes earlier. Mapmaker serves as pressure conduit, never stealing focus; their exchange sharpens her choice rather than explains it. Voice stays singular, tactile, and consistent under lyric duress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s contradictory mix of scientific rigor and romantic yearning is embodied in every micro-choice (how much of each vial to pour, when to pause). The final laugh that “stays, weighty” externalizes an earned interior shift. Lio’s secret and wrist-touch function as credible relationship crucible, not just backdrop. No stock phrasing or therapy-speak; even “density of presence” is stress-tested by the reactor’s physical read-out.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lucid-dream chronicler’s contradictory impulses—envy of past selves versus the need to keep an honest ledger—play out in concrete micro-choices (tracing the ridge line on the scroll, reading aloud to the grave). Each version encountered in the dream offers a specific, embodied value that reweights the waking self; the final renunciation of immortality for custodianship is earned and visibly costs awe. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of the jealousy method; it reads as strategy more than ache in two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The aromatherapist-narrator’s anosmia and “listening to water and to people” give a specific, character-bound way of perceiving; micro-choices (warming hands, refusing to remove the screw) enact a hierarchy of values—story over mechanism. The midwife’s single nod and “jaw like someone holding back a hillside” externalize her pressure and create a crucible that alters mutual stance. Interiority stays concrete, avoids therapy-speak, and the final quiet hand-touch on the dome shows earned endurance with felt cost. No secondary pressure from Master Isidor beyond helper role, but within the two-character limit this is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied; the scholar’s trembling hand, sugar-pebble offering, and wrist-scar count manifest contradictory impulses under ritual pressure. Micro-choices (whispering kite names, pressing sugar) directly tilt the lattice and cost is visible when scars warm into “tiny harbors.” Voice stays individual, though Elder Nam functions more as oracle than second pressure source. Just shy of 9 because the hinge realization—“bridges not cures”—is slightly over-articulated versus sensed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Protagonist’s haunted self-reckoning is embodied through trembling hands and voice choices; the apology is a visible micro-choice with felt cost. Flaws (rumor-mongering past) complicate the present action, and the endurance of the archive’s song offers credible renunciation. Interiority avoids label-speak; contradictions (profit vs. remorse) act simultaneously under pressure. Relationship with Mara shifts through shared silence and touch—an earned, costly reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The witness-narrator’s interiority is lyrically specific (“words were the smallest gears I trusted”) and the micro-choice to read the dictionary aloud to the chorus visibly alters the field, earning a conceptual renunciation. Yet the self-description “wanderingly exact” is asserted twice without being tested in a contradictory beat, so the trait remains decorative rather than a flaw that costs. No second on-page character means relationship/status bullets are waived; the single-POV arc is coherent but the absence of a tangible setback keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—the narrator both reveres and mistrusts the clocks—embodied in micro-choices like easing the valve with the inherited key. The final stance, accepting “razor edges” as necessary boundary, costs him the comfort of inherited certainty, legible on-page. One hairline slip: the glacier conjecture is asserted, not tested, so the cost is slightly abstract. Still, motivation tightens to a visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied—anchored in the laser button, humidity, spore-salted palms. Contradictory impulses (guard vs. guide) coexist in-scene and tighten toward the final hand-opening gesture. Ren and Mira function as pressure sources, but Ren’s emotional shift is told more than dramatized, keeping the relationship crucible just shy of full cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is precise (“my pulse that kept miscounting”), motives cleave across disciplines—probability vs luck—embodied in gesture (placing the lantern to soften fluorescent glare). The father’s refusal of soup and her counter-maneuver with carrots crystallize status flip with visible cost; micro-choice of lighting the lantern at the climax is decisive and earned. Flaw: “widening perspectives responsibly” drifts toward self-explanatory thesis; minor over-articulation near end caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is vivid—“I wet my thumb and spin the disc” shows embodied ritual—but the narrator’s motivation stays declarative (“to teach endings how to begin”) rather than tested under pressure; no contradiction or micro-choice visibly risks his creed, so renunciation feels presumed, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “gently thorough” disposition drives every micro-choice on the jetty; cradling the locket, pressing it into the ledger, and signing the tide are embodied, costly acts that externalize inner contradiction. The absent woman remains a felt pressure, not exposition, and the renunciation—“I can only write the ache she made useful”—earns its stoic weight through prior beats. Minor slack: the interior idiom drifts toward lit-crit near the end (“proximate causes we now own”), trimming the last ounce of lived specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s loneliness-cure motive is concrete and threaded through every beat; her “desperately jocular” mask is shown, not told, and the ledger micro-choices track a visible cost. Interior contradiction is present but stays summary-level (“felt seen only by their needs”) rather than erupting in a single, embodied beat under pressure. The final renunciation—handing off the moon rock and accepting surrogate love—earns its place, yet the moment itself is lightly sketched, blunting the full cost punch required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is richly embodied—"quiet blaze held under his ribs"—and every tactile beat (palm-to-bark, ring tightening) reveals a hierarchy of values: mapping truth vs. drowning in grief. The single micro-choice to open the ring and inscribe the stillpoint is the earned pivot that forecloses his old blank-map stance; cost is the cut of stillness he now forever carries. No contradiction or diagnostic speak; perceptual signature stays consistent, flawed, and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is rich and particular—his regret curls through the anomaly like smoke he once lit himself. The “confidently uncertain” stance is embodied in micro-choices: writing the marginal nine, warming the pen, refusing heroic overwrite. One contradiction pulses throughout—he edits history yet clings to humility, a paradox that sharpens the final cost. The relationship with Mara stays off-page but palpably steers every beat; her absent voice is the hinge that keeps the arc human.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—wanting to record yet using a film-less camera—anchors every beat; the micro-choice to “click” empty shutters dramatizes renunciation with visible cost. The advisor’s quiet charisma is palpable in gesture rather than label, her tap on the camera serving as concrete pressure. The ending’s Earned Stasis (carrying home the empty camera) forecloses the path of tangible memory, paid for by the ache in the narrator’s tingling fingers. Flaw: one moment of diagnostic self-awareness (“joyful sorrow”) just before closure; still, the body-as-shore image rescues immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the arsonist’s analytical bent feels lived-in and drives every micro-choice. The moral ambiguity remains credible because the narrator’s guilt and rationalization coil together in real time. However, the emotional cost of reunion is slightly under-dramatized—Mira’s first line of dialogue lands as thematic summary rather than embodied relief, softening the final renunciation’s sting.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrator’s quietly rebellious trait is embodied in the consent to coherence and the drumming that keeps Jonah present; the cost—her own outline blurring—feels earned. Interiority is vivid (“metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea”) and motives stay consistent to love and refusal to let grief win. micro-choices (tapping yes with knuckles) crystallize values under pressure. The risk of permanent fusion is acknowledged, satisfying the “visible cost” test for 9+; only the slight abstractness of “auroral sorrow” keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s vocation, childhood ear for gait, and mother-taught habit of listening to iron all surface in micro-decisions—choosing vents, folding maps, deciding to whisper not shout—so every tactic grows from embedded history. Interior contradiction is light but present: pride in quiet mastery brushes against the need to prove it publicly. The final act of spacing the wager tickets as future beacons shows a visible, scaled cost: he trades personal winnings for communal memory, earning a quiet, durable legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The guardian’s refusal to speak is embodied through breath-counting and mirror-work; the dented mirror as inherited tool gives concrete history. Emotions stay tacit—"two pages touching"—avoiding diagnostic labels. The final act of handing the mirror to the boy crystallizes a hierarchy of values: silence, stewardship, succession.micro-choice costs are visible, yet the inner contradiction between vow and intervention could be sharper under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coach’s interiority is rich and specific—his ability to “hear unspoken words” is shown, not told, and guides micro-choices like “I chose not to argue.” His motivation stays coherent: protect the grotto and the kids’ quiet refuge. Yet the climactic stand is collective and symbolic; the personal cost to him is implied rather than embodied, so the final renunciation feels slightly under-weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dock-worker’s “listening” flaw and “graceful” trait stay ornamental; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice shows these qualities altering tactics. The scrimshaw planting is the lone visible decision, but it is narrated as fait accompli rather than a pressured moment that costs the narrator something concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The performer’s contradictory impulses—reporting grief yet sheltering it—are dramatized in concrete beats (offering the bouquet, narrating the kettle). Interiority stays embodied and idiosyncratic; the final renunciation of forced cheer is earned and costly. Minor slip: the “moral ambiguity” is asserted more than tested in the inspector scene, keeping him just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The poet’s internal contradiction—wanting to cross boundaries yet refusing violence—remains abstract; we never feel the tug between those impulses in a single, embodied beat. His aesthetic drive surfaces only as narrative label (“still aesthetically driven”) rather than forcing a visible trade-off on the page. The custodians’ shift from wariness to open faces is asserted, not dramatized; no micro-choice shows the moment their stance alters. Closure rides a conceptual, not personal, cost: the boundary dissolves, but the poet’s own stakes feel static, so the renunciation is more idea than ache.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ilias’s color-blindness and “innocently cunning” hands are shown through concrete micro-choices—slipping the reed into the phoenix, painting with smoke water, trading herbs for trust. The interior contradiction between seeking imperfection and fearing praise is present but soft; the final quiet offer to stay shows earned endurance rather than a sharp change. Because the arc is accumulative/lyric, the absence of a single decisive renunciation is acceptable, yet the cost (Mara’s burned throat, the traveler’s sunken song) is felt more by others than by Ilias himself, keeping him just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bell-ringer’s calm, listening stance is embodied in every micro-choice (tuning, letting the child ring, refusing to preach); the final shrug-epiphany “I only arranged listening” crystallizes a credible renunciation of authority that costs him nothing yet gives everything to the crowd. Interiority stays concrete—“the sting of deep corridors” felt in the child’s hand—never drifting into diagnostic talk. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship bullets are correctly N/A. The only hairline slip: “powerfully gentle” is asserted more than tested, but the child’s bell-ring pays it off with visible metal.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    The jeweler’s grief is lived-in: trembling hands, failed houseplant, refusal to touch the living. The stencil-on-vellum acts as a second skin of the dead wife, forcing micro-choices—threading light through ash—that rewire his craft. Interior contradiction holds throughout: he courts suicide-by-oblivion yet feeds strangers’ seeds. Final renunciation—keeping the observatory open—pays the cost of perpetual exposure to others’ grief, earned by every prior locket laid in the corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrator’s “steady curiosity” surfaces in only one concrete micro-choice—agreeing to walk the pins—yet remains mostly abstract. Interiority is lyrical but generic (“confusion itself felt like a map”), not character-specific. No contradictory impulses appear in scene; the emotional arc is a smooth accumulation of wonder rather than a pressured change. The final “borrowed our breath” stasis is atmospherically earned but costs nothing specific to this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The historian’s contradictory urges—to hoard knowledge and to release it—drive every beat; her embodied, throat-burning presence is vivid, and the final surrender of the cages is an earned, costly renunciation that lands under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lone custodian’s vocation is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—warming the river stone, pausing the reel, inlaying stone into bark—each exposing a hierarchy of values (witness over rescue, catalog over purge). Interior contradiction flickers when the shadow leans in: simultaneous fear of being consumed and longing to confer shape, embodied in the held breath and steady palms. The renunciation—binding the shadow into a flowering book—pays the cost of eternal custodianship, foreclosing any exit for either party. This earned stasis is specific to this watcher and this dusk; no stock “grief librarian” archetype could swap in without breaking the circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The handler’s interior contradiction—steady hands only when holding mesh or a live animal—shows at once; their anger braided with compassion is embodied, not labeled, and the final micro-choice to offer repair while setting the no-prop rule lands with visible cost. Karim’s ash-pale collapse and long truth-shed turn his charisma into a torn net, making his flaws complicate rather than excuse. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-talk; the voice stays particular to a night-shift caretaker. Only a hairline slip: the “knowledge that people do not molt out of fear cleanly” edges toward aphorism, keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The speaker’s contradictory craving for closure-through-cutting is embodied in the suture ache and the deliberate re-cutting of the elm; the telepathic plant gift is accepted without therapeutic self-labeling. Micro-choices—reading coffee rings, kneeling to the ivy, asking consent before knifing the bark—reveal a hierarchy that prizes learning over possession. The final stance (“I will listen…read them in rings”) is earned by the underground ordeal and costs the protagonist the fantasy of erasing scars. Interiority stays sensuous and specific; no stock “I’m broken” talk intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s calm, map-making interiority is consistently voiced; the “I am here to find where unused love is stored” motive is plain and sustained. No contradictory impulses ever contend on the page, so the promised internal conflict is only asserted, never dramatized. The manager’s trembling supplies exterior pressure, yet the narrator’s stance never shifts or forecloses a path; the ending illumination feels gifted rather than earned. Still, the idiosyncratic perceptual lens and embodied film-handling details keep the characterization individual and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s motivation—freeing creativity—remains lyrically asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choice; the single decisive action (turning the brass circles) is too briefly embodied to expose contradictory impulses or cost. Interiority is evocative but stays at atmospheric distance (“I felt the hour between breaths open”) rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under duress; no visible flaw or mistake compounds. Earned stasis is declared, not crystallized on the page, so the cap on 9-band is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The guard’s renunciation of sleep and selfhood is embodied in the palm-on-clock moment; the contradictory impulse—cling to lone humanity vs dissolve into quantum guard-duty—plays out in scene. Interiority is concrete (“midnight freezes further inside his veins”) rather than diagnostic. The cost is visible (perpetual wakefulness, diffusion of self), but the interior contradiction could sharpen earlier to intensify the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—yearning for frontier yet fencing it—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices: clenching the gear, whistling the forest’s alloyed winds, finally biting the gear like a broken key. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the “wild frontier” is felt as mouth-blood. The final renunciation (chewing the gate-tooth) forecloses return with visible cost under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the faintest gestalt poverty in the masked figures keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    A clear internal want powers the beats, but interiority stays abstract (“unused courage waits”) rather than dramatized. Emotional labels (“my heart from running”) are repeated; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The kneeling offer is a micro-choice that advances, yet the dog’s return feels like gift-luck, not earned by prior flaw or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist’s liminal survivor-guilt is embodied through the tingling bolt and crutches; the bellhop’s mute servitude nicely mirrors the fortress ethos. Yet both characters remain allegorical ciphers: we get no contradictory impulse inside the bellhop, no moment where aiding the narrator could cost him personally. The final renunciation is credible, but the cost is borne mostly by abstract “choir” others rather than dramatized relationships on stage.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lys’s interiority—"carrying whole folios as if they were polite birds"—is vivid and idiosyncratic; her micro-choices (seasoning omissions, cupping hovering letters) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—drawing the iron-gall line through the pretender’s title—pays off every prior beat and carries visible cost: the rune hums, the ledger stiffens, the false signet flakes. Secondary characters (gardener, historian) apply immediate pressure without crowding choreography. The only hairline slip: the pretender’s "smile like linen" is repeated almost verbatim, trimming freshness from his collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and sensor-grounded; the tapping ritual embodies contradiction between scientific order and grief. Micro-choices (tapping dates, re-marking beacons) visibly escalate stakes. Mother’s absence-as-presence complicates motives without tidy epiphany. Hairline slip: “brave” note borders on sentimental label, barely keeping cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The barefoot stargazer’s interiority is vivid—learning “through skin than through fear,” letting soles “listen” to the stones—yet the arc is more posture than pressured choice. No contradictory impulse ever jeopardizes the reignition; confidence only grows, so the “awkwardly” half of the trait never exacts cost. The final stance crystallizes, but it feels foreordained rather than wrested from a lost alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—court fines vs plant-whispers—drives every beat; the final “I choose” is earned by the prior heat-cool cycles she alone times. The insurgent-grandmother label is never allowed to flatten into caricature; her ash-braided body and ash-softened dialect keep her specific. Missing only a sharper external status clash (the council stays off-page) to expose her limits mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Samira’s interior contradiction—wanting public honor yet refusing spectacle—drives every micro-choice; the freeze-breathe arc bodies her war trauma without therapy-speak. The photograph as ballast and the final niche-slide crystallize cost. Quiet talent enables the decisive relocation of ceremony, proving the trait is not decorative. One decimal off 9+ only because Theo stays functional backdrop; no reciprocal status tension sharpens her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    Interiority is lush and embodied—“luminescent ache” felt in her delayed brush-stroke—but the decisive shift from paralysis to painting again is asserted more than dramatized; we watch her untangle rope, not canvas. Still, the contradiction between needing light and fearing its shards stays live in scene and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sensorially rich (“salt on my tongue,” “wind takes the ink like a tutor”), motives stay taut, and the final micro-choice—bracing the beam inside the widened second—pays the cost of refusal. The sister-backstory loop is brief, anchored, and tilts present stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the anger stays coil-steady rather than splitting under pressure, so the 9+ gate fails by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cryogenic archivist’s contradictory drives—oath-bound custodian vs. clandestine liberator—are alive in every micro-choice: the trembling hands on the capsule, the deliberate misalignment of its slot, the self-naming as fuse. Interiority is concrete, sensorial, and never diagnostic: “my breath fogging the margins as if annotations could keep me warm.” The final cost is felt in the shared silence with the shadow—tea brewed, eyes lowered, a relationship altered without a word spoken. No forced symmetry; the moral ambiguity stays unsettled and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fisher’s calm resolve and self-imposed silence distinguish him, but he remains a mythic functionary rather than a person; the girl and vanished mother are never on-stage, so the promised emotional payoff is secondhand. Interiority is poetic but generic—any “cool-headed” hero could swap in without altering beats. No contradictory impulse ever threatens his composure, so pressure never pierce the archetype. Closure is serene but cost is off-loaded onto the unseen child; Earned Stasis registers, yet the lack of visible personal price keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The heiress’s contradictory impulses—protecting the paper’s integrity while fearing dynastic shame—are dramatized in the nib placement and technician confrontation; her renunciation of the donor-brightened sky costs her the easy coronation, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s guilt is embodied through tactile ritual (amber lens, red tether, silver ink) and every micro-choice is tethered to the nephew’s death; the final tattooing of the name lands as earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—”chiming that never fades” rather than abstract guilt. The contradiction between translating cries and misreading the one that mattered drives every beat. No diagnostic self-talk, only sensory confession.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chalk artist’s interior contradiction—needing to “listen backward” while guiding others—grounds every stroke; the tile’s whispers convert his social perception into tactile, costly choices (the gate, the banister image). No stock therapy labels; even the child’s question is met with a bespoke, character-specific answer. The final renunciation—pressing the cooled flake back into the moss—pays the visible cost of relinquishing control, earning the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrator’s contradiction—gentle yet steel-armored, merciful yet complicit in deception—lives in every micro-choice: pressing the tessera to earth, renaming the guard’s grief, offering water while risking death. Each action re-calibrates the stakes under the “aberrant mercy” premise, and the final earned stasis (lowering the rifle) is paid for by the visible cost of exposing his own fragility. No stock phrases; interiority is sensuous, embodied, and specific to this voice. Only hairline slip: “arms of steel” borders label-speak, but the image is immediately re-embodied through tactile use.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ghost’s synesthetic gift and coin-tarot agency give concrete, idiosyncratic interiority; “taste footsteps / see pitch of silence” is embodied, not label-speak. Motivation—lure possibility back for Rowan—stays legible and intensifies through orchard echoes. No internal contradiction or micro-choice visibly fails, yet the outside Rowan arc is inferred more than dramatized, muting cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid and embodied (“skin microflinches, breath catches, eyelid tremors”); narrator’s contradictory hunger to listen yet fear loss of control is present throughout. Relationship with Mara acts as crucible—her skepticism and tactile grounding force micro-choices that shift power. Final renunciation of pill-return is credibly costly because prior beats show the lure of unfiltered voices. One hairline slip: “therapy-speak” label “controlled empathy” appears in exposition without immediate embodied cost, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sensory-map-maker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—veins “like frozen rivers,” “thermal bloom of longing”—but the final broadcast choice arrives more as lyrical inevitability than a crucible that visibly costs her; the fossil’s hum is felt, yet her personal stake beyond vocation stays static, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hourglass turner’s quietly inspired trait and cataloging obsession are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between fatalism and agency is alive in scene. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A. Final renunciation of surrender carries visible cost—“we knew because we listened”—earned by prior pattern work. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—spy’s need to “fix what’s broken” collides with the knowledge that the burn erased his tether; the coil-from-pillbox micro-choice embodies that split. Embodied emotion is sustained: thumb on fern engraving, jaw scars, heartbeat counted against thaw. Final renunciation—accepting he must go where Mina cannot—carries visible cost under the causal lens. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—fear of erasure vs need for clarity—and the final micro-choice (one plain stitch) costs the narrator the ornate past. Coachman’s quiet authority pressures without stealing agency. Emotional embodiment is strong (“hands that trembled, yet the stitch held like bone”). Minor: coachman’s own stakes stay off-page, so relationship crucible is one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    The potter’s calm, tactile interiority is credibly idiosyncratic—clay under nails, “slow enough to hear clay explaining itself.” Choices (mending trough, brushing the queen’s crown) flow from this calm curiosity and trigger visible environmental feedback, so agency stays embodied. However, the arc is observational; the decisive “bow” and departure feel lightly motivated—no contradiction or visible cost inside the narrator, only a conceptual thrum. A stronger interior squeeze or palpable renunciation would push this to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Interiority is lyrical, body-bound, and idiosyncratic (“wistfully pragmatic” is lived, not labeled). The hinge micro-choice—angling the gauge tooth to open the padlock—crystallizes a values hierarchy (father’s steadiness > fear of trespass). Yet the narrator’s emotional arc is more accumulative than decisively altered; the “gentling” is shared but not personally costly, so the closure attains Charged Poise rather than Earned Stasis. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s isolation-to-independence arc is embodied through concrete micro-choices (angling the sundial, reshelving knowledge) and carries a visible cost—the cold ledger memory that “tried to drown me.” Tone: None functions as an earned emotional anesthesia, not a label. The vow at climax is credible, but interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“poor trustee of future continents”) that blurs immediate contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“I wrote her letters for others to sign, because my words knew the road and my heart did not”—and the final public-art renunciation carries earned cost. Micro-choices (tying ribbon, inviting strangers) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight reserve: the “inevitably whimsical” label is asserted more than dramatized in mannerism. Still, the arc from ghost-writer to self-exposure is credible and individual.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s cautious hope is embodied in micro-choices (chart-greased fingers, subsonic patch) and costs him sleep, social safety, and institutional protection; the final “we have learned to breathe together” crystallizes earned endurance. Interior contradiction—yearning to heal while knowing tricksters return—stays active in scene. The only bar to 9+ is that the provost’s abrupt conversion is seen from outside; we get no interior evidence of cost to him, so the relational crucible feels partial.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” contradiction are embodied in every beat—shallow breaths, ladder-counting, the lungs “taking careful, measured sips.” The compass-point gift and grandmother’s memory tether interiority to concrete stakes; the final choice to lift the compass and prick the air crystallizes the hierarchy of values (heritage over cartographic control) with visible cost. Missing only a touch more self-contradiction under peak stress to reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lio’s face-blindness, methodical gait-counting, and grief-mapping are vividly embodied; the ribbon test and polework externalize his limits under pressure. Interior contradiction peaks when he names the rescuer’s knot in reverse—proof he sees guilt though he cannot see faces. The captain’s confession lands as credible collapse because Lio’s prior restraint has foreclosed easy absolution. Only minor sag: “wanted to awaken dormant empathy” drifts toward thesis; the portrait itself enacts this, need not be named.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is specific and embodied (“thumb polished where I have rubbed questions”), contradictory impulses surface when the narrator questions whether exile-home still counts as home; the copper nail’s tactile re-use in two beats anchors agency. Motive to honor Seraphine is stated repeatedly but only dramatized once (cliff intake), so the higher-stakes choices feel lightly earned; competent struggle is present but not fully compounded. Closure renunciation (“I stay one more cycle”) carries visible opportunity cost—exile prolonged—so the final stance is credible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrator’s “dynamically observant” trait is shown through lush cataloging of sensory detail, but interior contradiction and embodied emotion flatline; the hitchhiker’s return feels willed by motif rather than driven by a visible cost to the narrator. Micro-choices (lifting the flake, agreeing to leave it) are present yet low-stakes, so the Earned Stasis is more asserted than dramatized. Voice remains coherent, but the emotional arc never complicates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The highway-robber’s son is rendered with dense interior contradiction—his “polished calm” is both legacy and startup product—yet the final renunciation (leaving bills, shutting the lion door) costs him the last identity prop, earned by the looping motif. Micro-choices (taping yen to clown car, handing seeds back) show hierarchy of values without expository label. One decimal off 9.0 only because the kid’s instant trust feels slightly frictionless; still, protagonist’s flaw complicates every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lucid-dream chronicler’s interiority is embodied and specific; the trembling hands, the scent of copper dawn on the telegram, the micro-choice to “whisper the names of the lost” all reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The shared-burden theme is lived, not stated: Mara's shoulders lower, the narrator's ledger becomes a breathing lung, and the final vow to “carry the weight of water as a village” costs both their prior silences. Relationship shift is credible and scaled to length; no stock epiphanies or therapy-speak. Voice stays singular and textured; contradiction between healing vocation and personal grief is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Issa’s interior contradiction—mourner and avenger—drives every beat; the prick-and-feed ritual is a concrete micro-choice that externalizes guilt. The final renunciation (using the seed to eat the binding she once cast) is causally earned and visibly costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the slight distancing phrase “warlike serenity” keeps her from full 9-band embodiment under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “root-bound” state is viscerally embodied—ankles braided, heart pinned—while the girl’s quartz-laden arrival forces a mutual scar-reading that crystallizes their shared covenant. Interior contradiction is palpable: hunger to move versus physical tethering, terror versus yes-saying. The final “step into the shared wind” is earned by the accumulating tactile micro-choices that loosen the roots; cost is felt as ribs ring like a bell. Voice remains singular, never drifting into diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “reckless idealist” contradiction is embodied in the kneeling-to-soothe-roots beat and the final pledge to share breath; the brother’s traded future anchors motive, but the Keeper’s pressure is filtered through lyric summary rather than a visible status shift, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites. Interiority is vivid, yet the moment of accepting scars is slightly abstract, keeping the cost one step from the body.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrator’s mix of technical fastidiousness and raw regret is embodied in micro-gestures—thumb prickled by cloth, grease on knuckles—so motive stays tactile. Interior contradiction surfaces when facts fail to anaesthetise the Abel ache, but the swing is declared more than enacted; we’re told “the ache opened” rather than shown a fresh physical tell. The final pledge to “midwife a new story” is credible because the cloth and set list have already forced memory through the body, yet the beat still leans on summary. Earned cost is present but compressed: the emotional price is felt, yet the decisive micro-choice that locks him into the dig happens off-stage in the paragraph leap from trailer to valley.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.7)
    The translator’s interiority is rich and embodied—his micro-choice to rotate the rails a fingerwidth crystallizes both method and yearning. A strong contradiction pulses between scientific method and occult memory, giving the “kindly methodical” trait palpable cost. The mentor remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is not tested; still, the absence is felt in every beat. Final renunciation of mastery is earned through the prior sequence, but the absence of another live character caps intimacy at this word length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The librarian’s interiority is richly particular—“I stamp the hours not in numbers, but in the shapes of returning feet”—and his micro-choice to smelt the baker’s wavering name into a tide-marked loaf crystallizes his stance under pressure. However, the lack of a palpable cost to him (beyond listening) keeps the arc one notch short of a fully earned renunciation. The contradiction between filing and accepting flux is dramatized, but the final beat grants him serenity more than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inspector’s vocation and secret avocation—collecting/cultivating abandoned hopes—are clearly opposed, giving him an immediate, embodied contradiction. His micro-choice to break protocol (crowning the stalagmite with the pearl) is a visible, costly renunciation of official identity, made credible by earlier tactile rituals with the tin and shell. Interiority never drifts into therapeutic self-labeling; instead, perception is filtered through the sensual (lantern low, pearl warm against skin). The only bar to 9+ is that the cost of his rebellion is more symbolic than lived—no consequence beyond the soft field of light is dramatized on him personally.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chronicler’s guilt-driven compulsion is embodied in every tactile micro-choice—penciling “Datum A,” shouldering the swollen door, clearing twigs one by one—so the final vow to “write toward self-forgiveness” is earned by visible, muddy labor. Interior contradiction pulses throughout: the need to confess wars with the reflex to pretty the map. The busker’s silent demand (“tell the town”) supplies external pressure that crystallizes the renunciation. Only the brother-love remains asserted rather than dramatized, a hairline slip keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The veiled dreamer’s interiority is textured and consistent—veil as both shield and filter, watch as metronome of patience—but the absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship/status bullets inactive. Motive (find the library) is stable, yet the only micro-choice that costs is the final letter-writing, so the arc feels more observational than crucible-tested. Still, the endurance of silence and the refusal to “read by tearing” amount to a credible renunciation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and embodied—"mulberry ache, thick sweet and stained with sky"—with contradictory impulses alive in scene. The final renunciation (melting the violin) is earned by the telepathic-plant backstory and the concrete choice to follow the stain-map; cost is visible in the river baptism and the director’s ankle-tangle. Micro-choices—setting saucers, lifting the bow—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. No label-speak; voice stays botanically telepathic and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the mortician’s contradictory calm/grief is dramatized through micro-choices (warming emerald against own palm, threading color from spark). Mother’s remembered voice supplies credible pressure without slipping into label-speak. Renunciation—letting the spark go—carries visible cost in the final image, fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The caretaker’s interior contradiction—using the same hairpin that memorializes arson to coax new growth—grounds every beat; the final micro-choice of pinning the tender cane without piercing it embodies forgiveness-as-praxis with visible cost. Emotional degradation under stress is absent (no trembling hands, shortened breath), keeping embodiment slightly short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—smiling politely while clutching a shard of broken hindsight—remains concrete and embodied; her throat moving “when futures test their weight” shows simultaneous want/fear without label-speak. The micro-choice to unhook the cloak crystallizes values (public duty vs. private doubt) with visible cost: she exhales “as if a complicated sentence finally allowed its comma.” Final stance is earned: she signs, but under conditions she could not voice before the mirror-and-chime ritual; the cloak is heavier yet lighter, a lived ambiguity. Minor hairline slip: “sincerely insincere” is named once; it never complicates an on-page decision, so motivation stays just shy of 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nameless narrator is convincingly porous and open, interiority rendered through body-in-trance (“stars felt inside my ribs”). The researcher’s reversed aging is shown only through externals—each appearance younger—yet motive remains abstract; no micro-choice dramatizes the cost of continuing the experiment, so the final “vanish” feels slightly predetermined rather than paid for on page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrator’s vocation as “harmonic stone skimmer” is shown only through silent listening and micro-choices—tapping the arrowhead, humming a single note—so the trait is credibly lived-in. Interior contradiction surfaces in the refusal to chase yet yearning to guide, embodied in the warming stone. Earned renunciation lands when stillness becomes the door; the cost is the perpetual return (“I seat myself again”). Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist’s underachieving-mage identity is concrete in the renunciation of his assistive-charm harness; his micro-choice to speak “salt, bread, thanks” instead of spells embodies contradictory impulses. Interiority stays particular (“I felt small, uncredentialed”) and the final stance of “waiting until the brilliant dimness brightened” is earned by prior causal beats. The absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible idle, and the “brilliant dimness” epiphany edges close to diagnostic label-speak, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lamplighter’s quiet hunger to “hear color” is concrete, embodied, and drives every beat; the admission “I was tired” and the final lifted lamp show a credible, costly shift from hiding to listening. Interiority stays specific and sensorial—no therapy-speak—yet the moment he presses the brass tag to wood to “listen” rather than open is the single micro-choice that crystallizes value hierarchy. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene between that beat and surfacing, so the internal conflict plateaus rather than intensifies, capping short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s quiet enthusiasm and statistical mercy ethic are embodied in tactile coin-casting and coolant distillation; contradictory impulses (doubt vs duty) stay simultaneous. The final renunciation—accepting the scatter, singing a patient hello—earns its cost through prior causality: the arrays’ thirst, the coins’ geometry, the prophecy’s demand for non-intention. Interiority is concrete (“stellar doubt keeps one finger on my heart”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The single on-page character carries the crucible alone; micro-choices visibly rank values under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and specific—“ribs vibrate when grief leans in”—but the reaper’s contradictory impulses stay mostly lyrical, not enacted under pressure; the final naming of “Enough” is earned, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than bodily, keeping it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lukewarm mage is shown through embodied ritual—counting drips, knotting rope, rubbing spit into bronze—so her mild magic feels lived-in. Yet the interior contradiction promised by “earnestly naive” never surfaces; she never doubts her bell plan, so the naïveté stays label-level. Because the choice to leave the bell is presented as inevitable success, the cost feels external rather than a wrench paid from her own flaw. Still, the micro-choices (each drip-count, the rope hand-off) keep agency legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The warden’s contradictory impulses—badge-duty versus story-keeping—are dramatized in the single beat of radioing “for a pause in enforcement.” Interiority stays embodied (“badge sits on a heart that still hears the chime”), micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, and the renunciation of legal erasure carries visible social cost. Ruth’s recognition scene supplies earned backstory that tilts present action without pausing momentum. Hairline slip: “precisely humane” is self-diagnostic label-speak, but it occurs once and is immediately enfleshed by the vetoed eviction of the photo line.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is lush and particular—she “wore discipline like armor and doubt like a delicate ring,” an embodied contradiction that persists through the piece. The sentimental collection of petals v. rational alchemist tension is dramatized when she chalks bird-turns onto bark, a micro-choice that fuses logic and wonder. Closure lacks a decisive external act, but the earned stasis—she will wait for the starlings—carries credible cost: her transformation remains deliberately unfinished, foreclosing haste. Voice never slips into diagnostic label-speak; every thought is filtered through sensory, orchard-specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mentor-student bond is viscerally embodied in the blind-folded webbing drill flashback and the mid-air buckle rescue; interiority stays concrete (“my stomach becomes the canopy”).  The watcher’s creed—erase the seam until guidance feels like home—is dramatized when Lio hugs the invisible guardian, not the person.  One hairline slip: “I revise my signal” could expose the interior calculus a beat earlier to justify the instant compliance shift.  Still, motivation escalates cleanly and the earned refusal of pride caps the arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for feeling yet fearing the return of pain—are embodied in the micro-choice to touch the jar; the cost is the audible crack of numbness. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding therapy-speak. The final stance (carrying the jar together) is earned because the narrator’s palms-on-glass act triggers the brain’s verdict that reorders custody. Flaw: Ori’s voice is vivid but the other half-siblings blur into a collective anchor-eye, slightly diluting relationship pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The proprietor’s interiority is vivid (“puzzles like weather systems,” “solve and unsolved hum in a single wire”) and his motive to protect wonder is dramatized through planting the seed and designing the Seed room; the final quiet vigil with visible cost earns the arc. Minor slip: the reunion belief in Mae is asserted more than tested, so the emotional peak feels 0.2 soft.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conductor’s mournful eagerness is embodied in every micro-choice—whispering to a carburetor, stroking pull-cord “spines”—so motivation stays visceral. Interiority is concrete (“urgency tastes like rain”), never diagnostic. The only soft spot: we learn nothing of the prior wound that made him willing to drink grief, so the arc’s cost feels atmospheric rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete (“safe, useless pieces”) and the final refusal to step through the window costs the guardian his return, but the epiphany “love sometimes means not crossing” arrives as a declared summary rather than an embodied contradiction; still, the stance shift is legible and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s contradictory impulses—stoic detachment vs. tender sensitivity—are dramatized in every micro-choice (cooling flues, sanding the wound, bleeding into the mix). His refusal to promise painless rescue, only “loss as currency,” earns the climax and forecloses the bishop’s authority with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted iron a second too late”), never drifting into label-speak. The only slip: the mill-mothers’ release is observed, not chosen, so the arc’s final cost is felt more by town than by him.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The interpreter’s calloused hands, mentor’s pouch, and final choice to “carry it” give embodied motive and micro-choice; the interior contradiction between memory-haunted caretaker and hopeful re-tuner is present but stays summary-level until the final beat, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The deckhand’s self-sacrifice is credibly rooted in his vocational pride and commuter-loyalty; the older self’s grin and the nod across boats crystallize contradictory impulses (stay/leave) in one embodied beat. Interiority stays concrete—“my feet thin into wake, my heart stretch into rope”—avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation costs him corporeal identity, a price legible on the page and scaled to the 800-word frame. Only the absence of a second on-page relationship keeps this shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—using geometry to hide from love while secretly yearning for connection—are dramatized in every beat: the careful metronome breath, the whispered knot, the final step along the curve. Her embodied shame and longing collide on the page, not in summary, and the renunciation of her old defensive rule-set is paid for by the public admission “geometry never protected her.”

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The instructor’s drive to “navigate by starlight” is embodied in every beat: the chain-link ritual, the petition risk, the final ascent. Contradictory impulses—safety of trench expansion vs. the blind urge upward—are held in tense, simultaneous breath. The father’s anchor both moors and launches him; the ring’s zero-shape becomes a horizon scale. Closure crystallizes this hierarchy of values: the city’s hum recedes, the sky reclaims, cost is the solitude of light.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “contact tracer for hearts” identity is vividly embodied through the hearing-aid ritual and the photograph hand-off; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. protective duty) stay active in-scene. Eli’s shift from frozen shame to surprised laughter is micro-chosen on the bench, not declared. The only bar to 9 is that Eli’s interior is still largely inferred—the narrator does the emotional labor; we don’t feel Eli’s hierarchy of values in his own words.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ivo’s claustrophobia, electroscope ritual, and naming of the lost are concrete, embodied choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; the final renunciation—to leave without extracting the data—earns its cost through prior tenderness and fear. Interior contradiction flickers (“fear now lined itself up behind duty”) but stays credible. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; micro-choices alone carry the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator’s heartbeat-counting and shard-handling embody concrete micro-choices; the clerical-death trauma motivates ascent and ink-reading. Flaw: interiority occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction (“a way of breathing that does not waste”) that dilutes embodied contradiction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s body-as-tool premise is viscerally embodied: “I wound wire from my own veins…tethered the diamond to my wrist.” Interior contradiction—offering personal names to a rumored curse—escalates to surrender; cost is felt when the jewel “grows warm and thirsty” and the speaker relinquishes memory. Micro-choices (where palm presses, when to split task) map a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final instrument-state lands as earned renunciation, bruise and all.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead rubbing, pun on “sedimentality,” tasting river stain—yet the metamorphosis from spy to “vow” is more declared than dramatized; we see the flint become tongue, but the emotional cost of abandoning Marko lingers off-page. Still, the self-mockery and lyrical perceptual signature keep the voice individual and flawed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Interiority is richly embodied (“tuned room, resonantly soft”); every micro-choice (wedging the shell, heartbeat tuning) is a sensory, stakes-shifting act that charges the climax. The arc from compliant performer to co-conspirator with stone guardians is legible, costly, and rooted in the teacher’s legacy. No diagnostic self-talk; contradictions live in muscle and instrument. The only drag: off-page teacher is the emotional engine—slight under-crank for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist’s interiority is rich but micro-choices under pressure are under-dramatized; the mother’s bottle and the boy’s token function more as symbols than as tactical pivots. The “respectfully rebellious” trait is asserted rather than enacted in a beat that costs him something visible. Closure leans on lyric image more than causality, so the 9+ bar isn’t cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    The carpenter’s quietly persistent creed is dramatized through concrete scavenging micro-choices; his “interpret silence as possibility” motive is repeatedly tested and finally paid for with breath and bucket labor. Interiority stays sensory (“metal hips settling into earth with a sigh”) rather than abstract, grounding motive in bodily cost. The arc hinges on a credible renunciation—he forsakes noise/applause for motion—earned by prior Pattern of listening and salvaging. Emotional progression layers patience over longing without tidy resolution, satisfying Earned Stasis closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is lyrically specific—“I breathe in threes,” “scarf warms”—but contradiction or visible cost never arrives. The promised arc (search → finding → custodianship) is announced, not dramatized; the final stance of humble service is asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that closes a path. No interpersonal crucible or status pressure tests the character, so motivation plateaus. Meets baseline for embodied voice and idiosyncratic detail, but lacks the causal bite demanded at elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The librarian’s interiority is dense and character-specific—his refusal to “trap the dream” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The palette as proxy for Aria’s absence gives embodied contradiction to his grief, and letting the dream pass through him is a credibly costly renunciation. Voice drift into lyric abstraction occasionally flattens embodied emotion, but the final porous stance is earned. Could edge 9+ if one more beat showed a concrete tactical loss tied to that renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Locksmith’s interiority stays sensory and embodied; the decision to taste the curl crystallizes a value hierarchy without lapsing into label-speak. Scholar’s motivation is legible through micro-gestures (trembling hands, ribbon-care) and the final taking of the “small glowing idea.” Cost is visible: the door inhales the past and the scholar steps into a future whose danger is felt but not spelled out. Only the “phantom limb” line teeters on diagnostic shorthand, preventing the final 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The folklorist’s interiority is vivid—her bodily memory of cider, woodsmoke, mother’s hands—but the only on-page choice is stepping into the mushroom ring; the “wrong name” debt is inherited, not freshly enacted, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than earned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archivist’s reflexive self-erasure and hunger to “teach the hinge to others” is felt in every micro-choice (walking backwards, spoken annotations). Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the renunciation at the end—holding still while others walk free—carries visible cost. Status shift with the girl is cleanly tracked: pity → alliance → gratitude, all through shared action. Only lack of a second contradiction keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pruner’s interior contradiction—obedience to the seed-charge versus the lure of invention—never crystallizes in a single, costly micro-choice. Every pruning act is reported as gentle success; no cut fails or wounds him, so the promised “visible cost” is only declared, not dramatized. The bees’ permission (“Cut kindly”) is the closest beat of pressure, yet it changes nothing in his tactics; he already prunes kindly. Result: arc is coherent but flat, missing the flaw-driven mistake that would force renunciation or price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator-protagonist’s vocation (broken-mask restorer) is interiorized as both craft and wound (“I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones”), a contradiction that stays live during the ritual. Micro-choices—threading the needle, handing the knot to the daughter, speaking the father’s name—are concrete, embodied, and visibly costed (the sanctuary’s hush drapes their shoulders). The bond with the daughter is not a relationship arc but a crucible moment that alters her stance and his; status shifts are legible in the transfer of the net-knot. No diagnostic self-help speak intrudes; interiority stays maritime, salt-stained, and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Interiority is concrete, embodied, and particular to the map-framer’s perceptual signature; “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” traits manifest in micro-choices (pressing the abrasion, counting breaths to henge stones) that carry visible cost. The final renunciation—sealing nothing, setting the panel lightly back—earns its stoic poise through prior因果链 of respectful listening and patient comparison of silent footage. Slight reserve on 9+ because the empathy motive is declared more than dramatized in conflict with a counter-impulse; still, the endurance reads as credible, charged stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s analytic grief and obsession with quantifying surrender are rendered through visceral, embodied beats (steady breathing around the splice, gloved fingers on the tape). The internal conflict between mapping and letting go drives every micro-choice; the final release of the globe is earned by a causal chain of discoveries that visibly cost him his prior detachment. Death as a conversational partner is more atmospheric than relational, so the “relationship” crucible is still solo, capping this just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The balladeer’s quiet, almost ritualistic determination is rendered through embodied micro-choices—unrolling the kit, clamping the bolt plate, grounding ink—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is concrete (“my breath tuning to the hush,” “singing for the gaps”) rather than diagnostic, and the final relinquishing of the bolt plate beneath the mural shows a visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in a single beat, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the arc earns a credible renunciation that forecloses no-loudness as a tactic. The character remains an individual voice rather than type, and the flaw (reticence) actively complicates the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The servant’s contradictory mix of warm curiosity and deliberate detachment is dramatized in every beat—slipping on the goggles, reading the diary, choosing silence—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority is concrete (“a cup catching only what overflows”) and never drifts into diagnostic talk. The only thing keeping this from 9-band is that the cost of renunciation is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Grief as physics: interiority stays meteorological, so panic never slips into therapy-speak. The flaw is absence of contradiction—once the method is chosen, no “what if I quit?” impulse surfaces to tension the litany. Still, micro-choices (knotting line to absence, lowering ribbon) visibly cost stamina and sanity, earning the late steadiness.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The face-blind portraitist is vividly interiorized through perceptual idiosyncrasies—mapping ceilings, breathing plaster—so interior contradiction is alive. Motive stays legible: finish a sky-portrait before demolition; every micro-choice (rubbing coin, mixing lime) feeds that goal. Cost surfaces in the final renunciation—leaving the coin and the room—yet the emotional price is more implied than embodied; an extra beat of body-level fatigue or grief would have nailed the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The apprentice’s quiet, listening nature is consistently embodied—talking to rivets, translating wind-tones with ribs. Motive stays simple and credibly stakes the climax: fold the light, not trap it. The final gesture of folding the strand into the dog-ear shows earned growth and costs the loneliness it first nursed. Interiority is concrete; no label-speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The locksmith’s interiority is richly textured through tactile ritual and memory; his father’s kit and the oil that “remembers ship decks”anchor contradictory impulses of repair vs. surrender. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The final renunciation—leaving the note instead of claiming triumph—earns its cost via the prior braid of reflections and frost, though the moment is lightly dramatized rather than punched.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The collective “we” acts as a single character whose trust in Vine is credibly earned through prior rescue (rockfall spiral) and the visible stakes of drought; Ana’s micro-choice with the bell is embodied and specific. Interior contradiction is light—no one questions Vine’s chalked authority even when risk rises—but the shared endurance/renunciation of old grudges is dramatized in the relay swaps. Cost is present (labor, pride, time) yet generalized across the group, so the emotional price feels diffused rather than individually acute.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The adjuster’s motive—“to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes”—is lyrically declared but never tested by an opposed want; interiority is atmospheric, not contradictory. The puppet-as-key-holder is a lovely micro-choice, yet the only visible cost is the slow of the clock, not a renounced desire. Emotional embodiment is strong (“bruised awe,” salt-taste of stillness) but stays in one register. Earned stasis is present, but the absence of a live opposing pressure keeps the arc just shy of top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The caretaker’s reluctance and self-erasure are embodied in every micro-choice; the moment he “presses the nut into the hands of the youngest” while confessing that giving directions “empties me of myself” crystallizes a costly, earned stasis. Interior contradiction is vivid: debt-bound duty wars with resentment, both sustained to the end. The only thing holding this from 9.0 is that the travelers remain anonymous lenses rather than crucibles that force a visible shift in his hierarchies—he was already this self-sacrificing pre-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s contradictory drives—molecular precision vs. human repair—are embodied in every micro-choice (pocketing the chrysalis as metronome, muddy fingers anchoring filaments). The brother’s arrival is credibly reluctant, their shared teeter on the bridge a lived embodiment of altered status. Interiority stays concrete and sensorially braided; the final renunciation of the chrysalis costs her the talisman she clung to, earned by prior causality. No stock epiphanies—just a stance crystallized in tensile notes.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vendor’s hunger to reach “where stories begin” is palpably embodied; every micro-choice (uncorking moonlight, incising the woman’s wrist, cutting his own silence) externalizes contradictory impulses. The price—offering up an “absence”—is dramatized on the counter in visible silver. Flaw: the father-silence is introduced late; its emotional weight is asserted rather than lived, capping the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chef’s tasting of memories is a vivid, character-specific lens that drives every beat; his decision to exhale a shard into brine crystallizes his interior contradiction between preserving and erasing pain. Micro-choices—wrapping hands, whispering “Stay,” ladling second bowl for the coral—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The boy remains a passive witness, so relationship crucible pressure is light, but the chef’s self-imposed contamination and earned fatigue land as credible flaw-driven consequence. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment stays salted, gustatory, and bone-deep.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives—sonic repair, cross-cultural bridge-building—stay legible and intensify; her pocketing of the inherited weight and multilingual scaling of the bridge are concrete, costly micro-choices. Interiority is sensuous, not diagnostic: “hands smelled like brass and paper,” “voice folded a room.” Status crucible with the councilman turns on his retrieved glove, not exposition. Final renunciation—leaving weight as vow—caps causality with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The helix-minded engineer is vividly interiorized—solder-weather metaphors, micro-choice of quarter-turn screws—but the moment of ethical decision (abandoning the flooded quarter) is filtered through retrospective summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The vow to “excavate gently” lands as earned renunciation because the fossil-vs-dream tension has been braided through every beat, so the cost is visible even if the peak beat is recalled, not enacted. Emotional specificity avoids label-speak; body and tool are one. Flaw: the eyes-caught beat is off-stage, muting the final moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archivist’s hunger and prism-minded lens stay consistent; every beat is filtered through perceptual refraction. Interiority is concrete (“latent blaze licked higher”) and tied to embodied motion. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the internal conflict reads as sequential rather than simultaneous. Micro-choices (“drummed the cadence the doodle suggested”) reveal values, yet the final reentry promise feels more accumulative than a costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sculptor’s interiority is sensorially textured and motive-coherent; yet the only decisive micro-choice—strumming the wires after the hedgehog’s nod—carries no visible cost, keeping the arc shy of a full renunciation or transformation. Internal contradiction is lyrically implied but not dramatized in a single painful beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The exile-tutor’s “thoughtfully precise” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—handing the stone, placing the king, tipping it as libation—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interior contradiction is present but subtle; a sharper moment of private doubt mid-scene would have pushed this to 9+. The student’s stillness-as-reply forces a visible shift in status, satisfying the relationship crucible. Cost is legible: the tipped king forecloses return to the city’s speed-trusting past.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pacifist tinkerer’s motives—recovering silence, refusing force—stay consistent and embodied; every micro-choice (lowering volume, matching breath to the hum) flows from the core trait. The absence of dialogue or secondary characters keeps the crucible internal, yet the interior contradiction is dramatized: the wish to “open” without violence versus the ache to hear what burns. The hinge’s final surrender feels earned because his earlier sonic seductions accumulate; the cost is the fennel-and-soot reminder that some voices can only be tasted, never quoted. Hairline shortfall: the pacifist label is once asserted rather than shown, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s olfactory gift and quiet ambition are vividly embodied; every beat of planting, masking, and breathing with the village is filtered through her peculiar sensitivity. Internal contradiction is subtle but present—she courts revulsion to teach stillness—yet the final cost is more collective than personal, so the arc feels slightly under-paid on the page. Still, her micro-choices (platform choice, willow-mask lesson, final sketch) track a credible shift from solitary experimenter to communal conductor.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pilot’s longing for the “source of resilience” and her tactile attachment to the broken arrow-tip give every glide and tether a believable personal stake. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic—she thinks in orchard, creek, and echo textures, not abstractions. Micro-choice chain is tight: waiting at the spill, pocketing the seed, deciding to shoulder through the veil—each costs risk and reveals grit. One hairline slip: the emotional aftershock when the shard is sealed is reported rather than embodied; still, the renunciation of upward flight and the seed tucked “near my heart” earn credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The investigator’s interiority is concrete—every chalk arrow and anemometer reading is a micro-choice that exposes a mind calibrating risk. The patch-as-compass moment crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth vs. safety) with visible cost: the torn cloth foreshadows the human price of trusting equations. The final “steadier hand” is earned; the causality chain from wind survey to safety grid is clean, and the refusal to let the air decide again is an Earned Stasis that forecloses the old path. No label-speak, no safety-hedging; the flaw is only that we never see the investigator’s own pulse spike—cool detachment borders on affective flatline.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell-ringer’s interiority is rich—synesthetic perception, embodied cold, the amber sheet as tactile memory—but the “certify wonder” motive stays lyrical rather than forcing a visible fork in action; the sculpted hush carries the emotional turn, yet the protagonist’s personal cost is felt only atmospherically, not as a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—“wearing failure like a map I had misread” vs. the resolve to harvest insight—yet the single on-page choice (playing the flute to listen, not cross) is micro, not path-altering; cost is felt but scaled to lyric mode, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The operator’s interiority is concrete—his “lucid turbulence” eyes, the metallic kiss after each trait-return—yet the apprentice’s motives stay abstract (“to understand the mathematics of emotion”). The borrowed-laugh swap lands as a sharp micro-choice, but the returned tenderness from a widow is told, not dramatized, muting the cost. Still, the mutual trait-lending creates a credible relational crucible that alters both stances by the final sheet-drying beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    The courier’s “jitter” is embodied early and revisited in the final image of “jittering need to prove presence,” giving interiority continuity. The contradictory impulse to keep wonder alive while cutting dependence on the pendant is dramatized in the decisive breath that releases it, earning a renunciation with cost. Mentor absence functions as lived weight, folding maps inside the reliquary, not mere backstory. Voice remains singular, though secondary characters (singer, woman) are more emblematic than crucible-level pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—rational mystic who nevertheless kneels to frost—are dramatized in gesture (palm to dashboard) and embodied cost (cooling-metal tick). The narrator’s micro-choice to speak the father’s name is earned by the prism’s prior refracted flare and the frost spiral locking onto that seat. Interiority stays particular: “smoke and rain on my tongue” vs. therapy-speak. Closure renunciation (apology made audible in steering-column creak) forecloses skepticism with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spinner’s endurance and final renunciation—sending the bead rather than herself—carries visible cost: she remains alone, tethered to the glowing frame night after night. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through loom-taught attention and amber-warmed skin; no diagnostic self-talk. The choice to stay and wait is earned by her mother-taught discipline and the orchard’s fragility, foreclosing escape with stoic ache. Sister’s return validates the sacrifice, proving the living orchard was the necessary anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The blacksmith’s quiet determination is embodied in every micro-choice—kneeling to tie silk, counting breaths against stone, trading laughter’s echo for arch stability—so that “meek” becomes a lived, tactical humility rather than a label. Internal contradiction (fear vs. forging) stays active in-scene; the final voice-loss is a credible, felt cost. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“fear a quiet animal that understood work better than panic”)—quickly re-anchored in bodily action, so deduction is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory-map-maker POV is vividly embodied—every beat filters through taste, scent, vibration—creating a credible perceptual signature. Interior contradiction is present: the narrator both craves truth and fears its gravitational drag, acted out in the choice to swallow the sea-glass taste and carry the voices outward. The cost is felt: “the pull in my teeth” and the final renunciation of hoarding weight. Micro-choices (tapping shard, climbing gantry, attuning breath) tighten the arc; no secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Flaw: late label “bridges do not hoard weight” slightly over-articulates what the body has already shown, keeping it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is vivid (“shape of silence a room makes”), but the keeper and Board are off-stage; contradictions stay internal, never tested in live status play, so relationship-as-crucible remains theoretical. The final custodial act is consistent with the reticent observer trait, yet the cost is more conceptual than corporeal, nudging the score below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s custodial identity, storm-baiting laughter, and lineage-taught craft are vivid and embodied; contradictory impulses (joy vs. dread) run together in the same beats. Micro-choices—cooling the wick, scratching runes—reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act of re-wrapping the wick shows earned endurance with cost: “glass also needs tenderness.” Interiority stays concrete, though occasional lyric height drifts toward label-speak (“shadowed elation”), slightly blunting peak immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid—felt as “borrowed thunder” in the chest—and the dye master’s gaze forces micro-choices (“listen with my shoulders”). Yet the arc is more emblematic than causally earned: the final stance of “lens not lantern” is declared rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeit, so the renunciation feels slightly abstract despite the visceral set-up. The donor-heart contradiction—simultaneously alien and cooperative—stays embodied, but the cost of adopting “iridescent caution” is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lone protagonist’s motive—wanting to learn what trees witness—remains singular, tender, and credibly obsessive; each micro-choice (scooping dream-dust, trading a twig for the pin) embodies this interior hunger under accumulating poetic pressure. Interiority is richly embodied, never diagnostic: “I felt my hands repaired by the moon” shows, not tells. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the arc edges toward monochromatic; still, the refusal to declare a prophecy and the quiet exit with the twig constitute an earned renunciation whose cost (continuing anonymous custodial labor) is legible. The voice never slips into generic custodian cliché; the idiom is specific to this moon-struck, ledger-keeping dream-sweeper.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    The memory-keeper’s interiority is lush and embodied—fear “as thin and cutting as mica” anchors motive—but the arc is more witness than actor; the final surrender of memories feels inevitable rather than a hard choice that costs him a path. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the text sings, but the character never surprises himself.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—harboring guilt yet clinging to self-protective solitude—drives every beat; the embodied ache of “felt the weight of paper, then the weight of the patron's breath” makes the mistake visceral. Her micro-choice to “let her own fear walk to the door and wait outside” crystallizes growth with clear cost. Flaw: the self-diagnosis “I harmed nothing by meaning well” drifts into therapy-speak, blunting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “creeping normality noticer” POV is vivid and embodied in early beats—cataloging quiet losses, pocketing a shell to fix the next starting place. Relationships with Maro/Keziah, though brief, force micro-choices (sharing bread, confessing complicity) that bend the self-image. Interior contradiction is present but stays shallow; no genuine error or flaw compounds consequences, so the final stance feels more declared than earned. Voice specificity carries the day, but the arc is observation-heavy, decision-light.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “gently meticulous” trait is enacted through the delicate handling of slides and the micro-choice to revise metadata to quiet a tremor—both carry felt cost. Interior contradiction is present: the desire to save every vow collides with the knowledge that some are already “halfway gone.” The final stance—continuing to measure while admitting uncertainty—is earned by the prior catalog of losses and the lone preserved wedding vow. The minus comes from the apprentices remaining indistinguishable stock observers; no secondary pressure is applied through them.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The protagonist’s motivation—recording the exact sound of trust breaking—is concrete, odd, and stakes-revealing, but interiority occasionally drifts into atmospheric self-mythologizing (“my nerves were ropes tarred and tight”) rather than embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices (letting the fob dangle, withholding speech) do force the fence’s reactions and expose his guilt, yet the emotional ledger between them is inferred more than dramatized. The final renunciation—leaving the map, taking only the recorded buckle—earns credible cost, but the father’s ghost functions more as emblem than as persistent pressure inside her decision path.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrator’s “luminous skeptic” trait is embodied through the faint glow and the refusal to believe until tasting proof, but interiority drifts toward summary (“I wanted to know…”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction under pressure. The ring-as-tongue method gives tactile micro-choices, yet the final belief shift is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. Naira’s authority substitutes for the protagonist’s earned change, so the arc feels assisted rather than compelle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is vivid (“graphite map of last winter’s faces”), but the memory-gift is stated more than dramatized under pressure; no moment forces the trait to cost him anything. The creative block is credible, yet the turn to draw again feels eased by discovery rather than compelled by a new, riskier choice. Emotional embodiment is strong; contradictory impulses are present but not sharpened into a single, irreversible micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrator’s body-as-barometer trait (“wilts near dishonesty”) is dramatized in the moment the Ear demands candor: wrists weaken after the gilded-lie confession, so the quirk actively forecloses the passive-voyeur option and forces the truthful payment. Interiority stays concrete and leaf-specific; no diagnostic self-talk. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: hoarding best inks > cruelty days boxed > rereading letters for desertion counts. The final stance—standing still while the ribbon of stolen words fingers the plate—earns its hush by prior因果, and the cost (public exposure of his trade’s hypocrisy) is felt in the shaky wrists that still hold the copper spindle. Slight shortfall: no second character on stage, so “relationship crucible” bullet is N/A; head-room remains for 9+ had a client shard been allowed to up the status heat.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s seasonal silence and tactile tuning give embodied interiority; her insistence on borrowing apprentices’ voices while mute shows contradictory impulse under pressure. The aurora-thinning stakes are personal, not abstract, and her final knuckle-strike costs her the last sliver of iceberg, a felt forfeiture. No secondary character exerts independent pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A, but her micro-choices—channeling wind into water-percussion—reveal value hierarchy with visible price. Voice remains coherent through synesthetic perception (“tasted like rain on copper leaves”) without diagnostic self-label.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The android’s contradictory yearning—to archive memories yet flee the museum it tends—drives every beat; the burn decision crystallizes when “the hiss loosens,” embodying embodied cost. Micro-choices (drawing the copper corridor, miniaturizing its own noise) reveal a hierarchy of values: archive < survival < self-redefinition. The childhood-storm box is handled twice, each time tilting present stance; no stock “machine wants to be human” cliché. Final renunciation—stepping through the breach while paint curls—pays the price foreshadowed in “controlled burn escape.”

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The curator’s “listen-first” identity is embodied in every micro-choice (calling for coffee, refusing to force the lock). The final renunciation—opening the mailbox only when the community voices converge—pays off the trait with visible social cost (time, risk of fines). Interiority is concrete (“sandstorm calm” as practiced breath), not label-speak. Missing a hair more contradiction under pressure to hit 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Protagonist’s interiority pulses through embodied rhythm—each heel-toe syllable, valve hum, and dice clack externalizes contradiction between fear and refusal to drown. Calm defiance is lived, not labeled: the dance teaches the cameras while hiding salt in meter. Inherited dice and mentor’s last breath anchor motives; final choice to surface leaves Sora’s console behind, paying visible cost. Micro-choices (rolling, dancing, whispering) reveal hierarchy: liberation > survival > memory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ilya’s interiority is textured—his pocket “rectangle of absence” is a sharp embodied cue—and his micro-choice to exhume crystals and carry them to the whale gives consistent motive force. Contradictory pull between civic forgetting and private ache stays implicit; the final stance (ringing the whale) is earned. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity holds. Voice stays specific to a quiet, salt-breathing observer, avoiding diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The summoner’s interiority is consistently concrete—his “listening for what was not there,” the crane-wing map of silences, the cupped-hands gesture—so his motivation to silence the prophecy feels lived-in and earned. The micro-choice to rotate the wing once, changing star-lanes, crystallizes a visible pivot under pressure; the cost is the quiet relinquishment of cosmic ingress, a credible renunciation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in a single moment, so the 9+ gate is just missed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tutor’s calmly spectral presence and the narrator’s earnest apprenticeship create a believable, lightly comedic crucible; interiority remains concrete (“faint comic ache in my molars”) and the final promise is earned through prior listening drills. Yet both characters stay within their atmospheric roles—tutor dispenses wisdom, pupil absorbs—so contradictory impulses and higher-stakes choices never surface. The decision to keep returning is credible but not freighted with visible cost. Fine for length, but not yet pushing against personal limits.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.3)
    The charmed-skeptic tension is lived in every beat: tending the garden while doubting its promises, handling the shell while testing its hinges. Interiority is concrete (“I tell her… that dawn is moving”) and embodied (“bones ring”). The final shift from keeper to door is earned by a chain of micro-choices (carrying the shell, placing it, standing until the hinge answers) that foreclose the safety of quarantine with visible cost. Voice stays singular, flawed, and decision-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is rich and embodied (“the cold sang through stone,” “wrist steadied by forgiveness”), but the mentor remains off-stage and the single on-page character’s contradictory impulses are only implicitly dramatized; the final renunciation (leaving the hinge on his own name untouched) is foreshadowed yet still feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lyrical but stays embodied; the shell’s warmth and hiss tether abstraction to flesh. The choice to sing for every stolen half crystallizes a value hierarchy—voice as gift, not commodity—yet the council’s flight feels slightly convenient, trimming the cost that would push this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s vocation as “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” is vividly embodied in every image and gesture; interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak. The decision to carry Leda’s name out is seeded early in the pulse-borrowing dream and paid for in the final cold lift of the globe—an earned renunciation of anonymity. Micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, lifting) crystallize a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only bar to 9.0 is that the ghost herself remains slightly emblematic; her agency is felt but not internally conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The philosopher’s quiet, tactile micro-choices (sniffing salt, tracing mesh, refusing sardines) embody a believable contradiction between ascetic serenity and covert social engineering; the widow’s grief-anchored dexterity is equally specific. Both characters’ motives tighten into the shared, costly act of re-knotting nets to spare turtles while sparing villagers’ pride—an earned renunciation that forecloses blame. Interiority stays concrete (“tentative brightness of someone knotting two thoughts”) and avoids label-speak. Only Li remains slightly generic, muting the crucible effect and keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is sharp—"miracles make me itch"—and micro-choices (stepping into the stillpoint, holding the diamond) are embodied and costly. Motivation stays consistent: truth-excavator vs. Klay’s stone-clutching faith. The final renunciation—naming the engineered stillpoint yet agreeing to omit names—pays off earlier causality with visible social cost. Minor slip: Klay’s psychology is sketched more than dramatized, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “lonely visionary” is the sole POV; interiority pulses through lyric first-person and tactile micro-choices (sweeping rust, threading ash-toned music). His starved motive—shape dawn from storm-shadows—gains moral weight when he refuses the stage, accepting permanent anonymity to keep the signal alive. Kestrel’s emergence tests but never eclipses this; the narrator’s final renunciation of limelight is earned and costs him visibility. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Contradictory impulses (duty to mother vs. flight from grief) drive every beat; the “jar of Kin” micro-choice crystallizes the renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is sensorily anchored (“salt-stung quiet,” “pockets full of corks”) rather than abstract. One slip: the lighthouse-widow moment is told, not dramatized, muting status shift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction is strong—engineer’s “logic braided with ache” collides in the vault hum—and the final renunciation costs him the Collector’s possible alliance. Still, no bodily detail under peak vibration (only “dust of decades”) keeps embodiment slightly abstract; that caps the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The horizon mapper’s interior contradiction—dream-drunk cartographer vs. pragmatic convoy skeptic—drives every beat; the final quiet nod from Kerr shows relational shift with cost. Micro-choices (tilting slate, unyoking dogs) embody values hierarchy under pressure. One slip: “restless pulse” summary borders diagnostic label, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s “fortified vulnerability” is lived-in: every beat of lantern-lit noticing, stopwatch timing, and glove-on-hinge grit shows a mind trained to measure yet haunted by inherited light. The choice to unclip the earpiece and phone the union/journalist crystallizes a value hierarchy we have watched form in real time; the cost—career suicide—is legible in the sudden silence that falls after the director’s voice hits the ballast. Interior contradiction pulses throughout (“I stay watchfully calm” while memories braid tighter), satisfying the 9+ test, yet the great-grandmother’s line about “password that trains could not read” drifts toward inherited wisdom rather than freshly embodied pressure, preventing the final 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chaplain’s interiority is vivid—“machines need second opinions, because the first sound is only intention”—and his micro-choice to apprentice Hector remotely is earned. Yet the moral calibration stays almost too tidy; no blind spot complicates his authority. Mara remains functional, her dialogue a gentle cipher rather than a person with stakes. Still, the chaplain’s contradictory impulse—preaching mercy yet demanding deeds—carries real cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sera’s reckless curiosity is viv-idly embodied (“writes equations on saltproof napkins while the sea licks the rafters”) and drives every micro-choice; the final bell-pull crystallizes her idiosyncratic values. Interior contradiction is present but stays safely above diagnostic label-speak. Flaws complicate action rather than decorate it, and the cost—aloneness, bodily risk, tool wear—is shown, not declared. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship/status dynamics off the table.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pursuit of deleted Lia files drives every beat; identity under pressure stays concrete—the final renunciation leaves palpable cost in the closing image. Only flaw: brief therapy-speak tag “sensed absence” used twice near climax without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is rich and embodied; the narrator’s contradictory impulses (calm vs. cut thumb) collide in-scene. The final choice to walk the fracture is earned by prior micro-choices and costs the illusion of neutrality. Minor slip: “diagnostic” self-labeling in “calmly intuitive” drifts toward therapy-speak, capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The euthanasia-tourist premise is interiorized through lyric, body-level beats (“parasol tip ticked against my chest like a metronome”). Interior contradiction—yearning for endings yet postponing the button—drives every micro-choice. Cost is felt: the appointment keeps slipping, stakes stay personal. Voice never drifts into diagnostic speak; the flaw of loose-reality gripping is lived, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sentinel’s quiet, reflective agency—pouring wine into soil, offering the charred letter, withholding a name—feels consistent and particular; the renunciation of certainty for a living question is embodied in micro-gestures rather than宣言. Interior contradiction is subtly alive: pride in solitude vs. the craving to midwife connection. Cost is legible in the libation and the final extinguished lamp. The traveler’s presence is thinly drawn, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted; the score rides on the narrator’s credible self-complication.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio’s “strangely honest” trait is dramatized through her scar anecdote and the way she teaches knot-listening; the narrator’s motivation to “consecrate” sharpens into a micro-choice when he knots the final thread. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“I felt the hinge… learn our names”). The only slack: the narrator’s shift from observer to co-agent is late and compressed, so the cost feels more communal than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archivist’s calm is more stated than dramatized; the tremble Ole notices is the single embodied crack, not a sustained contradiction under pressure. Interiority is lyrical but diffuse—more cosmic than character-specific—so micro-choices feel lightly authored rather than wrestled. Still, the final lighter case and the town’s bow supply a visible cost and earned stasis, keeping the arc coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Scholar’s interiority is rich—“language still grew…in the intervals between breath and shelf”—and his listening posture is embodied. Motive stays consistent, but the stakes jump externally (Archive Court) without a matching internal inflection; we get no new flaw or fear triggered by the summons. The final renunciation—returning the crystal, accepting stewardship of unborn words—costs him the comfort of certainty, yet that cost is implied rather than dramatized in a visible beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prophet’s precognitive forgetness and chalk self-commands dramatize interior contradiction in live beats; every micro-choice (planting an arrow, chalking “Keep”) is a renunciation that forecloses future paths with visible cost. His body remembers what his mind will lose, so the gestures themselves become the character arc—an embodied stasis that pays the price of perpetual departure. No stock interiority; even the final kiss to the recorder is a tactile confession of exile from his own memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The repairer’s interior contradiction—yearning to anchor ephemera while releasing Lina—drives every micro-choice; the leaf-loop calibrates both camera and grief, making the final “forgiveness” feel earned. Embodied emotion (“luminous ache in my ribs”) keeps interiority concrete. Cost is visible: letting go of Lina’s literal voice is the price of restoring time. Voice stays singular; no second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The therapist’s calm micro-choices (using the vinyl shard as pick, dialing twice) embody “decisively kind” under lethal pressure. Ruth and Lena’s reparation is credible because the shard’s shared guilt is palpable. Interiority stays concrete—orange rind, kettle hum—never drifting into therapy-speak. The only flaw: the sister fight backstory is summarized, not dramatized, slightly muting motivational depth.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    The apprentice’s hushed curiosity and tactile habit (“my hands remember better”) individualize him, but his sole decision—closing the brass ring without extracting the shadows—reads more as received wisdom than active renunciation; cost is implied, not body-felt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrator’s “forgiving skeptic” duality is alive in every tactile beat—bone-setting clinic memory vs. readiness to credit a fox-guided changeling—but the father’s off-stage grief (the emotional fulcrum) is only reported, so the highest-stakes relationship never becomes a crucible that visibly alters the narrator’s hierarchy of values. The final apology is narrated as intent, not dramatized choice, so the cost is felt second-hand.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The watcher’s interiority is textured and consistent—choices (“I weighed each piece,” “I set the pearl...”) show hierarchy of values under pressure. The memory of losing the sky personalizes motive, but the stakes never tighten beyond a gentle equilibrium; no credible mistake or flaw complicates tactics, and renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than costly. Interior contradiction is implied, not dramatized in a single high-stakes beat, so the arc reads as serene accumulation rather than tested change.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—yearning for public absolution while fleeing it—are embodied in every micro-choice: returning to the ruins, repurposing the amber bribe as sun-catcher, sewing moss across rust. Each action visibly costs solitude and reopens the wound of viral exposure. The final image of “honeyed hush” crystallizes a renunciation that could only come from this exact interiority. Voice remains singular, never sliding into therapeutic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The novelist’s divided conscience is rendered through embodied micro-choices—kneeling to the circle of books, pocketing the shell—that externalize guilt and hope. Contradictory impulses (erase vs. honor) coexist in-scene, powering the final vow to “write it as it is.” Interior voice stays concrete, poetically compressed but never therapeutic; the cost is the acknowledged betrayal of his own characters, paid in the chilling shell-ring that closes the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lio’s interiority stays anchored in tactile ritual—cradling the vine “like a luthier holds a bow”—and every micro-choice (selecting the tendril, singing in tree-grammar) is traceable to his tinkerer-trait. The final laugh-and-lie-down is a credible renunciation that costs him the spotlight, paying the visible price of exhaustion. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on-page, so the arc stops just short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s interiority is concrete—her charred gloves, the sewing-needle map, the wrist-scar—yet the brother Fen is only a name, so the emotional cost is filtered through lyric memory rather than live relationship. Micro-choices (kneeling until knees “forgot complaint,” freezing her lashes to the raven’s clack) dramatize patience and risk, but the climactic map-reading is summarized, not enacted, softening the felt price. Still, her flaw—believing pulse can outwit white noise—drives every beat and forecloses retreat, earning the eastern march.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The locksmith’s interiority is concrete—his vow, periphery habit, and cellar-of-reason metaphor remain consistent and embodied. Micro-choices (chalking daisy-angles, filing gears to echo-count) reveal values under pressure. Yet the arc is more absorption than change: no contradictory impulse or visible flaw is tested; the stance at exit is the stance at entry, so the “earned change” bar is only partly met.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Fractal weaver’s interiority is vivid and embodied—kerosene ritual, whale-bone cord across shoulders—but the final “acceptance of the circle” is announced more than dramatized; we feel the ribbon’s tug only after the valley-person speaks, not through an active renunciation that costs on the page. Interior contradiction is present (stay/bind vs. leave/release) yet remains lyric-stated rather than forced through a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path. Still, the sensory anchoring of motive in metal breath and scallop-cool shingles keeps this solidly above the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Widow’s grief is rendered through tactile micro-choices (carving, sugar, mane) that externalize contradictory impulses—clinging vs. letting go. Interiority stays concrete (“useful is not cold…woven from what remains”) and avoids label-speak. Final pocketing of the cage is earned renunciation with visible cost: the ache in her healed wrist and the coiled mane she can now carry without choking.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to restart the rains yet fearing the return of grind—are dramatized in the camera-wheel clicks and the final memory-payment; her fifteen-year-old vow is surrendered with wrench specificity, earning the renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“regret loosen…as a dropped wrench”), never drifting into label-speak. The ghost’s mirror-status forces a visible cost: loss of that vow’s innocence. All beats grow from her scavenger pragmatism and chronologic disorientation without competence drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s “curious” tag is shown through tactile micro-choices—testing railing cold, tuning valves, writing numbers on tile—each a visible micro-choice under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“numbers feel like handholds”) and contradictions appear (hope vs. limits). The sextant shard literalizes her trait, charging the final beam-aiming beat; cost is felt when she accepts “how many lights she can afford.” No second character on page, so relational bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradiction between vowed silence and the ache to be heard is dramatized in micro-choices (breath on glass, finger-weight). The moment of bearing—not ringing—the bell is a credible renunciation with visible cost, earning the closure. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The seeker’s interiority is vivid and embodied—every beat of poling, every flicker of the sundial shadow is filtered through a mind trained to distrust clocks and read stains. His contradictory impulses (rage vs. colder patience, salvage vs. exposure) act simultaneously in scene, not in summary. The final stance—naming currents instead of shouting—earns its cost: the foreman’s bucket-set-down slump, the siren’s conscience-cut blast, the sundial’s black verdict across the logo. Micro-choices (waving the key, half-tarping crates, speaking “not loud, but thoughtfully clear”) crystallize a hierarchy of values that forecloses silence without turning the protagonist into a crusader caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush, embodied (“rope cools its grief into my ear”), motives cohere, and the final shared planting is a credible micro-choice that costs time/social risk. The “infinitely patient” trait is shown, not told, in the slow listening. Minor: the fisherman’s shift from skeptical to co-protector is sketched more than dramatized, slight thinning of relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Interiority is rich and singular—“gulls sound like hinges,” “palace carpet weft thread…coiled as if it remembered the loom.” Micro-choice of tying the thread to the finger crystallizes the narrator’s vocation under pressure; the renunciation of leaving becomes an earned stasis with visible cost: staying to till others’ grief while writing his own living obituary. Contradictory impulses (wander vs. anchor) coexist in-scene, not in summary. No stock therapy-speak; every emotional label is earned by concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prince’s contradictory kneeling to both metal and “a heart learning” gives a vivid, embodied interiority; his refusal to surrender the egg is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost. Micro-choices—tuning a pilot light with spoons, mapping tremors—reveal a hierarchy of values, though the emotional crescendo leans on lyric assertion rather than fresh embodied beat. Still, the final endurance reads as individual, not stereotype, and the compromise he accepts is scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The protagonist’s contradictory identity—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—generates immediate, embodied tension; every graft she makes is a micro-choice that costs her both apology and knife-steady resolve. The boy’s arrival applies external pressure, forcing her to articulate the hierarchy of values (mercy over fire), and the final relinquishing of the coin shows endurance with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, tied to tactile fire-craft; no diagnostic speak. Motivations scale cleanly: the emotional after-image of patricidal heat drives each new willow splice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s skeptical empiricist streak and lantern-glow contradiction are vividly embodied from the first sentence, giving us a coherent, contradiction-driven interiority that stays consistent. The father-fear secret lands as a credible emotional key and earns the panel-opening beat; the moment of letting the river-taste memory pass through without clinging shows micro-choice under pressure. What keeps this from the 9-band is that the interior arc plateaus there—no further contradiction is pressure-tested once the box opens, so the “change” feels more reported than re-lived. Still, the voice-specific perceptual signature (mica dust, brass letter-blade) threads every beat, so characterization remains the story’s strongest pillar.</question>
    
    <question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Closure is undeniably on the page: a Conceptual Repricing in which the city’s stalled time and the narrator’s filial fear are simultaneously restarted/released, with a felt gust of pepper-lilac wind as cost. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight because/then, but the breadcrumb-glass motif teaches the pattern early and the heron-shadow key completes it, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and never drift. The only micro-teleport is the brass blade suddenly in hand for prying, but the tool has been foregrounded as a letter opener earlier, so the lapse is hairline, not fatal.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrator’s motive—coaxing rather than burning light—threads every beat and crystallizes in the final gifting of fused gears. Interiority is sensorially anchored (“old ache,” “cautious mouths”) and collides with micro-choices: rebuilding the orrery, deciding to teach transit as kindness. Contradictory impulses (sentimental hoarding vs. risk of sharing) stay active in-scene; the smile at “numbers becoming weather” shows embodied emotion without label-speak. Cost is visible: the inherited vow is literally handed off, foreclosing sole guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The carver’s meditative slowness and inherited patience are credibly embodied in the chisel work and ribbon tracing; the interior contradiction between listening and cutting is present but stays summary. The final act of loosening the braid shows a micro-choice with cost, yet the grandmother’s spectral guidance remains a felt presence rather than a force that pressures him to change stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Voice and gesture are individual, though the emotional arc is more accumulation than pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    The winder’s obsessive accounting of guilt via shot-pellets is embodied, specific, and drives every beat; the rake-handle confessions externalize an interior ledger without therapeutic self-labeling. Contradictory impulses—seeking absolution yet hoarding cullet—coexist inside the pendulum pause, and the final choice to keep two pellets crystallizes earned stasis with visceral cost. No moment drifts into generic “grief” talk; even the father’s drowning is filtered through tactile kelp and splintered ash. The micro-choice to tongue each shot before verdict is irreplicable, making the character inseparable from the tale’s machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single, nameless “I” carries the entire piece; interiority is rich and particular (“ignorance cartographer”), embodied emotion vivid (“shoulders drop”). No contradictory impulse is staged in scene—pressure is mostly rhetorical—so the final choice feels pre-declared rather than wrestled. Still, the vocation-level motivation stays consistent and the micro-choice to write the trellis not the wall is credible with felt civic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s copyist precision is embodied in every micro-choice—annotating lyrics, bowing the E, teaching seams—so her luminous hands and refusal to cloak the final reply feel earned. Interior contradiction is muted; she never doubts her hidden purpose, so the arc is less a change than a steady intensification. Still, her quiet authority and the visible cost of exposure at the end supply credible endurance with felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The protagonist’s interiority is gorgeously particular—charcoal as listening, lies hiding at the jaw-line—and every micro-choice (folding the drawing, feeding the flame, dusting ash into the mask) is tethered to the rule that nothing leaves. The emotional cost is unmistakable: the refusal to let Soren keep the portrait burns a path. Missing 0.1 to 0.2 only because Soren’s own contradictory impulses are implied rather than shown in scene; we get the scatterer’s reading of him, not his body betraying two urges at once.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sewer-philosopher’s voice is knife-sharp and specific—philosophy “drips downward” anchors worldview in body. Interior contradiction is alive: contempt for factions yet covert desire for legitimacy, enacted when he copies the ledger for both but keeps the cog. Emotional embodiment avoids labels—“pulse checking the moon” makes the finished chronometer feel like a heartbeat he can finally trust. The final stance—continuing to live beneath until clocks or children fail—earns its stoic cost, foreclosing ascent without sentimental heroism.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator-teacher’s interiority is concrete—her grandmother’s crack-winter zither memory guides present tactics—and micro-choices (rotating the nicked rosette) visibly cost her authority to catalyze the mechanic and nurse. Yet the students remain typed (headphones boy, scarred mechanic) and their private turning feels narrated rather than embodied; the choral breakthrough is attributed rather than individually tasted, so the ensemble change lands as group summary, not personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The toll-keeper’s involuntary truth-telling is vivid and embodied; his micro-choices (asking for reason, sliding the match, admitting he cannot lie) reveal hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present—he calls the wire in his throat both nuisance and blessing. Cost is visible: he risks the city’s power by trusting Mara with the harp fix. Voice convergence is minor; his diction stays consistent, but Mara’s engineer skepticism could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator’s motivation—restoring “aliveness” to houses by reading micro-displacements—is vivid and odd enough to feel singular. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and consistent, especially in the tactile handling of salt air, drawer angles, and photo falls. No contradictory impulses are dramatized under pressure; the choice to “ask the rest” is more gesture than crucible, so the cost is only lightly felt. Still, the voice’s perceptual signature is so strong that characterization remains memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living-statue POV delivers a consistent, stone-cold perceptual signature (“I thread my message along the cracks”) and several embodied micro-choices (waking statues, asking the bishop to open his hands). Internal contradiction is present but soft; the narrator’s motive to “welcome nuance into certainty” is declared more than dramatized, so the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than costly. Still, the voice remains singular and the actions track with the telepathic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “grim optimist” is more mood than motive; interiority is rich yet decisions stay abstract (“I climbed, believing…”) rather than dramatized through irreducible micro-choices. The dice roll is the only concrete action, but its stakes are summarized, not embodied; endurance at the end is credible yet feels like a foregone thesis rather than a spontaneous, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Anya’s contradictions—insomniac yet patient, methodical yet dream-driven—stay active in every micro-choice. Her body registers fatigue through terracotta warmth and mint scent rather than labels. The renunciation of sleep and the open-door policy carry visible cost: she banks the lamps alone, palms inkless vow. One slip: the “methodically hopeful” tag is asserted twice; still, the trait is dramatized by the ledger she keeps at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The guide’s interiority is rich—“the way a lighthouse talks to the dark”—and his inherited lens and bread-ritual reveal a believable caretaker whose flaws (stoic over-function, dread-as-perfume) stay consistent. Micro-choices—holding twin lenses to the cataract, matching loaves to costumes—earn the final crossing. Yet the cast swells to “children and grandmothers,” blurring individual arcs; only Anno is named, so relationship pressure stays diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The clock-maker’s stubborn inventiveness is shown through tactile micro-choices—winding runes into gears, tasting iron, tightening screws while hearing sobs—each feeding the obsessive interior contradiction. The sister-as-missing-stake motive stays primal and unabstracted; every backward tick visibly costs him years of regret, earning the final renunciation. No diagnostic label-speak; body and tool are one under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s interior contradiction—love for the ringmaster versus need to survive his haunting—is dramatized through embodied micro-choices (handling the clasp, entering the booth, confessing). Flaws (obsessive devotion, photographic erasure) actively complicate tactics and cost is felt when the stripped fear-image is pinned to the mirror. One lingering softness: the “whispering advisor” is accepted as real without any interior pushback or doubt, slightly flattening the self-deception arc.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prophet’s vow to “barter with weather” provides a solid emotional spine, yet interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“restless euphony threaded the salt wind”) that tells rather than embodies tension. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene; the dub sequence is pure external choreography, so the micro-choices feel like musical stage directions rather than psychological beats. Closure is a polite bow to the wave—gestural, not costly—so the renunciation reads as graceful but unmotivated by on-page friction. Character charisma is high, but flawed humanity is traded for incantatory persona.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cartographer’s quietly driven nature is embodied through tactile micro-choices—cracking the latch, blowing the whistle, reading glare-hexagons—each action tightening stakes. Interior contradiction surfaces when awe of the watchers vies with grief for the teacher, culminating in the earned recognition that maps must listen, not speak. The final “cautionary map” carried home shows visible cost: the teacher is gone, the city still imperiled, yet orientation is restored. No label-speak; every beat is filtered through shell-grammar perception.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s “emotionally rational” stance is shown through her throat-heating then cooling with numbers, a terse embodiment of the trait under pressure. The internal contradiction—feeling steers but does not blind—drives every micro-choice from tracing ivy to persuading Tomas, and the final resolve to publish costs her anonymity. Secondary pressure from Tomas is crisp: his worry about blistering the town forces her to justify the breach, altering their status. The ledger haul is earned, but the backstory capsule (“hired in whispers, despised in pamphlets”) is floated without on-page corroboration, muting the depth of her exile.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The surveyor’s interiority is vivid—“I am less man than listening notation”—but his stoic/sensitive duality is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse under visible pressure. Micro-choices (pry stone, seal note) are procedural, not value-laden, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned. The archeologist-of-dreams motive stays lyrically stated; it never collides with an alternative want, so the arc is static. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, keeping the portrait above mediocrity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The indexer’s quiet, methodical resolve is credibly particularized; the refusal to let “rage propel the index” embodies a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction is present but thin—no moment shows him tempted by revenge, so the renunciation feels preemptive rather than earned in-scene. The micro-choice to leave the chalk arrow pointing “toward beginnings” crystallizes his stance, yet the cost is more symbolic than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern-maker’s grief-need is vivid and embodied (“dress in ache”), but interiority drifts toward poetic label-stack (“luminous torment”) that blurs contradicting impulses. Micro-choices (polish gem, fold crane) map motive to action and earn the closing reconciliation. Shadow-return lands as earned stasis with visible cost—relinquishing the cranes and accepting residual brightness. Still, the lyric register edges into performed self-diagnosis, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The survivor’s refusal to mine the pool of regret is anchored by the geode-crystal beats and embodied memory; interiority stays concrete, never slides into label-speak. Micro-choices (signing the note, locking access) crystallize a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The stance shift is earned yet the partner Liyun remains functional furniture—no status pressure or distinct voice—so the relationship crucible is weak. Still, contradictory impulses act in-scene and the final renunciation carries causal weight just shy of 9-band purity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drone-pilot's interiority is concrete—techno-poetic, not explanatory—and the pilgrim’s perpetual surprise is embodied in micro-gestures rather than labels. Their mutual recognition (standing in the blank, naming the other) earns a quiet cost: the pilgrim must cease motion, the pilot must accept a silence-path home. Relationship functions as crucible, but secondary-character pressure is light; the pilgrim is more catalyst than counter-force. Motivation remains sharp throughout, though the missing-pieces backstory is summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The genealogist’s guilt is viscerally embodied (“hair shirt,” “counterfeit shade”) and drives every micro-choice on the driftwood shore. The interior contradiction—profiting from erasing children while discovering he was one—erupts in the split crescent mark, forcing an earned renunciation. Voice occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“tempered regret is the only armor”), blunting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The negotiator’s interiority is concrete—weight of grandmothers desk-pull, ledger finger on Daro’s line—and micro-choices (untethering lantern, demanding names) visibly cost him social breath. Interior contradiction flickers but stays subsumed by role; still, the final “I will hold this furrowed hush” crystallizes earned endurance with felt residue.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrator’s interiority is vivid and character-specific (“merrily melancholic by habit,” “muscle-speech of ferries”), contradictions play out in scene (pride vs. shame while paddling), and the final renunciation of hoarded apologies is earned. Cost is felt: sister closes the compass lid as if blessing a wound that has finally breathed. Still, the sister’s interior remains unlit, muting the relationship-as-crucible effect, and the “broken navigator” trait is more asserted than demonstrated in navigational failure during the presentAction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrator’s contradiction—“clean slate seeker with a dirty past”—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices: cupping guilt-lit water, steering by a scuffed baseball’s spin, confessing the arson while watching the lake bruise brightness. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The final stance—ribs “practicing hinges”—is a credible renunciation that forecloses absolution yet accepts cost. Only the brother thread is named, not staged, so status dynamics remain off-page; this caps the score at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The beast-whisperer’s vocation is shown, not labelled: micro-choices (bargaining with deer, kneeling to fox, tasting spices) reveal a hierarchy that privileges communion over command. Interior contradiction—grief’s pull to break vs. love’s demand to bend—remains embodied in trembling hands that steady only after inhaling star-anise galaxies. The earned transformation into feathered lover carries visible cost: bones protest, throat feathers, and the final refusal of a single human name forecloses return. Relationship-as-crucible is off-stage; the dead lover appears only as ember-shape, so status dynamics and secondary-character pressure are minimal but acceptable within single-POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is lush, idiosyncratic, and body-anchored (“my lungs stinging at the height”). The narrator’s contradictory twin pulls—cling to lost time / learn to spend recovered time—are voiced in-scene and crystallize in the final hand-tracing on the sleeping baby. Micro-choices (loosening the brooch, aligning saucer crack with palm) visibly cost her last talismans, earning the Earned Stasis. Flaw: the “willingly perplexed” stance is declared more than dramatized in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pacifist oath is embodied in the refusal to let the warhead pry the lock; every micro-choice (threading filament, pricking thumb, breathing the door open) externalizes the creed. Interior contradiction pulses in the admission of past bruises given and received, and the final bargain—to hold what cannot be healed—costs the narrator the illusion of personal absolution. The child’s weight on the cot strap literalizes stakes; the voice never drifts into self-congratulation. One hairline slip: “ghostly resolve” is abstract label-speak amid otherwise visceral embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s “destitute philanthropist” paradox is dramatized through embodied alchemy: she unscrews jars, coaxes bugs, counts constellations in her pack. Micro-choices (patching skiff, leaving rope) reveal a hierarchy where attention is currency; the final quiet gift of her last coins shows the cost scaled to length. Interior contradiction is steady—she both craves invisibility and keeps stepping into myth—yet the closing line “transformation wore her name lightly” lands as earned stasis with felt cost. Voice stays coherent; no diagnostic self-help speak intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is rich and sensorily anchored (“keys clinked like cool birds nesting”), but the narrator’s emotional contradiction—vigilance vs complicity—stays verbal rather than forcing a micro-choice that costs him on-page. The final “I was also a hinge” lands as earned renunciation, yet the pivot from loyal sentinel to co-conspirator could have carried a sharper, visible price (e.g. a guard’s challenge he must betray). Still, the perceptual signature is consistent, flaws complicit with poetic duty, and the occupation-specific metal lore keeps him singular.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The herder’s precognitive curse and the promise to the woman create a palpable interior contradiction that drives every stone placement; embodied micro-choices (“I hum the numbers until they taste like salt”) keep the arc visceral. The final shared holding of the bowl crystallizes an earned renunciation—he relinquishes sole ownership of the pattern—yet the cost feels fractionally under-dramatized because the woman’s presence is summoned rather than negotiated in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ilya’s interiority is lyrically specific—“the world seemed to rarefy around his ribs”—and his poetic vocation is shown through action (carrying redacted notebooks, reciting the banned poem). The moment he stands on the catwalk and reads to the storm is a credible renunciation that costs him the safety of silence. Mara functions less as a second character than as a catalyst voice; status/push-and-pull stays soft, so relationship crucible is only lightly charged. Still, the flaw-to-cost pipeline holds: the same sensitivity that got his work censored now propels him to expose it to lightning and witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The philosopher’s mechanical arm, oiled joints, and needle-card choices embody a coherent hierarchy of values—precision, memory, diplomacy—tested under steel. Interiority stays concrete (“servos purr like attentive cats”) and contradictory impulses (fight vs. trust) collide in the final disarm. The courier’s shift from antagonist to co-reader is credibly forced by the protagonist’s refusal to humiliate, paying visible cost in torn sleeve and softened voice. All traits alter on-page tactics; no label-speak or safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The poet’s voice remains idiosyncratic and embodied—“lines squeeze my ribs,” “I change like the phases above us”—so interiority feels textured, not diagnostic. Monthly persona molting stays largely ornamental; it never forces a trade-off or visible cost, so the promised constraint never alters tactics. Micro-choices (seeds in wall, screws in doorway) reveal a hierarchy of values: poetry over legality, shared archive over solitary safety. Closure is a credible renunciation: they accept perpetual trespass and moon-timed homelessness in exchange for the library’s rebirth; cost is legible in the dawn chill and the child’s entrance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pianist’s ache is embodied in the bench-wobble and reel-hand splice; interior contradiction (pride vs. longing) is active in-scene when he files the minute hand into the projector. The four broken-clock beats visibly foreclose his old refusal to forgive, earning the final winding. Missing higher band because Mara’s post-corridor interiority is summarized, not simultaneously contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lone “reality checker” is a vivid narrative consciousness, but every action is reported in lyrical summary rather than dramatized micro-choice; we never see a moment where contradiction or visible cost forces a forked decision. Interiority is poetic but generically weighted (“luminous doubt keeps me lit”) rather than specifically embodied. The final “audit complete” beat is declarative, not a tested renunciation; therefore the required Earned Stasis/Charged Poise cost is asserted, not experienced. The villagers remain a collective chorus, so no status crucible or secondary pressure applies.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    The bonsai tutor’s interior contradiction—patience laced with guilt—is embodied in micro-choices (snip the branch, open the compass, speak the apology). Emotions stay concrete; the “slow-spoken” trait shapes gesture, not label. Flaw (guilt) drives every beat; renunciation at the blue pool costs him the chance to unsay the silence. No stock abstraction, no safety-hedging—character remains individual, though the late arrival of Mara as off-page motivator slightly dilates relational crucible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—salt and metal on hands, tactile attention to dust maps—and their scientific worldview shapes every micro-choice. Motivation (“strip needless drama”) conflicts credibly with emotional loss (the botanist’s notebooks), yielding decisions that foreclose heroic gestures in favor of pragmatic triage. The final renunciation of spectacle for slope-work feels earned through consistent characterization. Minor deduction: the botanist’s arrival lacks friction, slightly softening the cost of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“breath settle into the valley's long exhale,” “steadily adaptive hands learned new timings”—with contradictions (maker vs. survivor, fire-destroyed yet fire-reliant) shaping micro-choices under pressure. Motivation intensifies credibly from survival to purposeful creation, and the final renunciation of vengeance for artistry carries visible cost: rebuilding not above ground alone but also underground in secret. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through tactile, profession-specific perception. The mentor’s off-page presence exerts crucible-like pressure without violating single-POV constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—blue-lipped survival, pulse-thrumming forks, heart as buoy—and their vow to “translate silence into music” fuels credible, costly choices. Sura’s “silently expressive” presence acts as crucible, not ornament; their collaboration pressures the narrator toward emotional and artistic risk. The final Charged Poise—answering without sound—feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., softening cadence for a sobbing child). No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (fear vs. wonder) pulse in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The undertaker’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief, stubbornness, and professional ethos intertwine without therapy-speak. His micro-choices (hiring the skiff, wedging into the seam) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in giving rest. The final renunciation isn’t tidy; it carries the cost of permanent entanglement with the drowned. His contradiction—wanting to silence signals yet answering their plea—is active, not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s “gently persistent” nature manifests in concrete choices—braiding Noor’s and Farid’s routes, refusing to ring the bell—that embody her philosophy without exposition. Interiority is filtered through communal “we,” yet individual contradictions (Noor’s impatience vs. Farid’s caution) emerge via action, not summary. The final micro-choice—Mara breathing across the bell instead of ringing it—reveals a hierarchy of values where silence protects more than sound. Flaws like Noor’s craving for credit feel authentic, not schematic, and drive the central tension without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s spiritually curious interiority is embodied through tactile ritual—breath, bellows, salted paper—not abstract longing. Contradictory impulses (to blur vs. reveal, hoard vs. release love) act simultaneously in scene choices. The woman from memory isn’t a ghost but a refracted self demanding integration, and the final renunciation of ownership (“heal without owning”) carries visible cost: surrendering control over past pain. Flaws like avoidance manifest as technical choices (shallow breath = thin image), making motivation inseparable from method.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The hedge maze designer’s interiority is vividly embodied—breath as “tiny planets,” photographs disintegrating like ash—and his motivation (“to discover the texture of time”) drives micro-choices with tangible cost. His contradiction (building to escape entrapment yet courting it) plays out in scene, not summary. The final renunciation—surrendering the halo fragment and photographs—is earned by prior causality and exacts visible emotional toll. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion remains tactile and specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“staggering grace that belongs more to purpose than to balance”—and their motivation intertwines personal legacy (“my grandmother tuned that piano”) with communal duty. Contradictory impulses (liberation vs. chain, flight vs. rootedness) act simultaneously without resolution into tidy epiphany. The final choice—to share seeds rather than hoard or flee—is earned through micro-choices (chaining to bench, wedging arrow) that reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: they bind themselves to history so others may grow free.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—between seeking truth and fearing its cost—are embodied in tactile, sensory choices (e.g., burning the promise note while listening to its “whitening hiss”). Their synesthetic perception isn’t decorative but shapes every decision, especially the climactic confrontation with the father. The final act of setting the orchard to grow enacts Earned Stasis: a renunciation of resolution that accepts relational fracture as irreversible. Flaws drive inevitable mistakes—trusting memory over presence—and the cost is felt in the aurora’s “weary miracle.”

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied, with contradictory impulses—thief vs. healer, observer vs. participant—clashing in real time. The encounter with his future self crystallizes a decade of unspoken grief into a single, luminous choice. Micro-choices (unscrewing the jar, staying beside the door) reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving life over capturing light. The final renunciation—“I did not steal, I simply stayed”—carries visible emotional cost and reframes his identity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glassblower’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (stubbornness vs. mercy, control vs. surrender) act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (counting breaths, narrating tasks) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: exile, solitude, the risk of flawed vessels. Her past trauma (“critique came like hail”) informs present behavior without over-explanation. Final renunciation of defensiveness feels earned through consistent causality and sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s phobia-ridden interiority is embodied with visceral specificity—shaking hands, mapped exits, breath “arguing with itself”—and never lapses into diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. certainty, flight vs. confrontation) operate simultaneously in scene, especially during the floor trap climax. The final renunciation of composite identity (“mine”) is earned through prior micro-choices: decrypting the cast, threading the projector, refusing to stop Kellan. Flaws actively complicate tactics without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scribe’s obsession with unmappable distances and his internal tension between cartographic precision and poetic silence feel deeply embodied, especially in his micro-choices—like drawing “lines that were less like roads and more like pauses between breaths.” The oracle’s presence forces a credible reconfiguration of his values without breaking character. His childhood memory of the pier integrates cleanly as a tactile cue that tilts his present stance. Both characters act from consistent, flawed worldviews, and their dialogue carries distinct idiom shaped by profession and myth.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The janitor’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—seeking thought’s origin while performing mechanical duty—and each micro-choice (bowing the violin, marking dots) reveals a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation remains consistent yet deepens under pressure, culminating in stewardship over ownership. The final renunciation (“I did not need ownership, only stewardship”) is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual weight. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The registrar’s interior conflict—between silence and truth—is embodied through micro-choices (handling the lens, logging the confession) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. Rell’s presence sharpens the moral stakes without reducing him to a foil; his silent admission feels earned. However, the protagonist’s shift from complicit quietude to public exposure lacks a granular beat showing the precise moment of decision under pressure, slightly softening motivation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vine dresser’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “withered” posture, pragmatic grip, and shame-laced memories cohere into a singular voice. His motivation—to prove gardens remember devotion—is rooted in past deception and aged regret, compelling his ritualized actions. The confrontation with the Auditor crystallizes his values: mended deception as care, not fraud. His endurance carries visible cost (bent shoulders, social marginalization) yet culminates in Earned Stasis that feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Hale’s motivation—to prove time moves sideways—is embodied in precise, consistent actions (lever-pulling, drone-tuning) and rooted in a past fall that left him “between seconds.” His internal contradiction (mechanical precision vs. metaphysical longing) manifests in tactile choices: anchoring the nexus, easing the lever to spare the flock. Sera’s presence sharpens his restraint, not through dialogue but shared silence and micro-gestures (heat pack left on her bench). The final renunciation—letting dreams “unspool without the pull of his proof”—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: his scientific ambition yields to care.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The musician’s motivation—driven by anxiety, inspiration, and ghostly communion—is embodied through micro-choices like tracing rosined letters and playing the disruptive harmonic. Internal contradiction (obedience vs. intuition) manifests physically in breath, bow tension, and silence. The final renunciation of explanation (“language seemed as clumsy as wet wood”) earns Charged Poise with palpable cost: carrying secret knowledge while the world resets to normalcy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s guilt, grief, and professional duty collide in embodied contradictions: swallowing truth with coffee while grinning for donors, hesitating to call during Luca’s absence. Interiority is precise (“ache that feels like auroral sorrow”), never diagnostic. The final act—speaking the warning—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost (chest heaving “as if a glacier turned inside me”). Luca’s off-page presence exerts crucible pressure through memory and artifact, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“drowsy alertness bloom behind my eyes,” “knuckles split and a notebook full of rumors”—and their motivation (to weigh a swallowed truth) intensifies through micro-choices like turning the valve wheel despite resistance. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. liturgical ritual) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The final act—carrying the ledger and tag—earns Charged Poise with visible cost: a life reoriented by truth. No diagnostic label-speak or tidy resolution mars the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is richly embodied—contradictory impulses (to record vs. to tend, to hold vs. to release) act simultaneously without tidy resolution. Their motivation (“grips reality loosely enough to let all versions breathe”) directly enables key choices (e.g., reinforcing the swan with index cards, refusing to claim the child). The final renunciation of sharpening the pen into a knife earns an Earned Stasis with visible cost: enduring transformation without control. Flaws like wavering hands under buckling worlds feel human, not safe.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Felix’s silence and gradual re-engagement feel earned through embodied micro-choices—thumb tapping, heel response, touching the curl to the bowl—each revealing internal conflict without diagnostic language. Lena’s clutching of the hair curl conveys maternal grief with restraint. The therapist’s “cautious exuberance” is consistent and modulated by professional humility. Final vocalization (“mama”) emerges organically from accumulated sensory cues, not forced catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The odd historian’s motivation—collecting what walls remember—is embodied through tactile, ritualistic actions (handling diaries, aligning with the tapestry) that reveal a coherent interiority. His “sensitively perceptive” trait drives micro-choices (angling the lantern, holding diaries like birds) that feel earned and specific. However, his internal contradiction remains abstract; we see devotion to memory but not the cost of that devotion until the end. The final act of writing is compelling but lacks a prior moment of doubt or resistance that would deepen his emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mei’s interiority is vividly embodied—her micro-choices (seeding fortunes, taping punctured slips) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in quiet resistance. Her “accidentally prophetic” trait isn’t mystical but tactical, born of reading currents rather than forcing outcomes. The constable’s open palms and the teacher’s ledger show how Mei’s orchestration activates others’ latent ethics without control. Final renunciation—choosing flow over force—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara and Ruan are rendered with precise interior contradictions—her thinning voice versus the entity’s hunger for stasis, his rhetorical combat against possession. Their micro-choices (palette grip, pedal press) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. The demon’s voice through Mara feels like a genuine psychological fracture, not a caricature. Final renunciation is earned: Mara’s relinquishment of the palette carries the cost of lost control made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—“chronologically homesick,” “thumb-circles and vows,” “cold knives my lungs”—all fuse memory, sensation, and motive without diagnostic abstraction. Contradictory impulses (longing vs. exhaustion, silence vs. symphony) act simultaneously in scene. The nautilus shell and childhood mapping aren’t just motifs but tools of micro-choice that shape posture, gesture, and ascent. Final renunciation (“make the whole score stand and breathe without you forcing breath upon it”) is earned through accumulated pressure and carries visible cost: the conductor must vanish for the music to exist.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lio’s interiority is vividly embodied—his guilt inverted into heat, his breath counting to twelve—and his contradictory impulses (floating vs. falling, defiance vs. surrender) act simultaneously in scene. His final choice to release resistance is earned through prior micro-choices and carries the felt cost of relinquishing eternal recurrence. The “periodically eternal” condition isn’t just stated but lived as a constraint shaping every action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete perception (“mouth full of river light”) and tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lena’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through tactile reconnection—is embodied with remarkable specificity: her deafness, her students’ mirrored detachment, and the broken needle all converge in micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction (wanting to feel yet fearing overwhelm) acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. Risto functions as crucible without overshadowing; their silent communication deepens stakes through pressure, not exposition. The final renunciation of numbness is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her vulnerability and changed teaching practice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through storm-recording metaphors that double as emotional and ethical filters. Contradictory impulses—patience vs. urgency, solitude vs. alliance—are active in scene choices (e.g., fastening the tube back, forming a plan with the woman). The final renunciation of comfort for unowned truth is earned by prior micro-choices and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; voice remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lantern broker’s interiority is vividly embodied—tears as “fountains,” grief as “ambush”—and his restraint with the vial reveals layered contradiction: longing versus self-protection. His micro-choice to open the vial only after ultraviolet light reveals his partner’s initials feels earned and costly. Dr. Vale functions as a pressure-applying foil without overshadowing the protagonist’s arc. The final declaration “I grieve” crystallizes a renunciation of illusion, marking Earned Stasis with palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The poet’s interiority is vividly embodied—ash in pockets, ear for “tender static”—and their ethical playfulness directly shapes pivotal choices. The escapee’s trauma feels lived-in, not symbolic, and the tension between memory and release drives credible micro-choices (e.g., braiding rather than surrendering the rope). Final renunciation of the map is earned through consistent character logic: patience as active, not passive. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile perception (“rope curled as if listening”).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her acoustical perception, grief for the rainforest, and reverence for the unfinished shape every micro-choice. Her motivation (“to find beauty in the unfinished”) drives credible renunciation of perfection, culminating in a resonant Earned Stasis. The boy and diver apply pressure that deepens her arc without flattening it. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in action (“refusing perfection and inviting the errors to sing”).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrator’s contradictory impulses—empathy versus detachment, insight versus self-preservation—are embodied in tactile, profession-specific actions (e.g., calibrating amperage while reading grief). Liora’s presence forces micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: she chooses to witness rather than drown, and he chooses to enable without possessing. The final renunciation (“what I make for others rarely keeps for me”) is earned through consistent interior logic and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cargo broker’s interiority is concrete and profession-inflected (“numbers are my native tongue”), with micro-choices (delivering the envelope, pledging logistics) that reveal a hierarchy of values. His motivation—to uplift silent contributors—emerges organically from backstory (the uncle-locket link) and drives credible action. Lena’s “whimsically attentive” trait manifests in specific behavior (bookmark constellations), not label-only. The final renunciation of fanfare for quiet acknowledgment feels earned, with visible cost: restraint over recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to graft onto community—is embodied through tactile choices (cart of reeds, weaving the bench) and contradicted by fear, creating layered interiority. Neri’s “boldly sympathetic” presence functions as both mirror and catalyst without flattening into archetype. The final act of weaving is earned by prior vulnerability and micro-choices (sharing marsh stories, accepting the search). Cost is legible: anonymity traded for belonging, with emotional stakes crystallized in “luminescent ache.”

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The illustrator’s interiority is vividly embodied—her curiosity “nibbles through warnings like moss,” and her bravery is tethered to sketching, not heroics. Her contradictory impulses (duty vs. discovery) act simultaneously during the sluice-lifting, and her final release of the echo enacts Earned Stasis: she foregoes possession to preserve balance, with cost felt in “clumsy pauses and unsatisfying silences.” The mentor’s ghost haunts her choices without overriding agency, and the pendant-use reveals a hierarchy of values—truth over safety. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile perception (“stone, wet feathers, hush of a library stairwell”).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The conjurer’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—grief manifests through tactile rituals (glass eyes, copper wire) rather than diagnostic labels. His motivation arises from ambiguous loss, yet his micro-choices (humming to stalactites, aligning cracks with constellations) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over rescue, pattern over possession. The final renunciation—accepting the unfinished as partner—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of perpetual uncertainty. No emotional summarizing; every feeling is filtered through mineral radiance and patient pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crawl-space dweller’s interiority is embodied, specific, and consistent—emotions arise through tactile memory (copper taste, railing pulse) rather than abstraction. Mara’s raw eyes and steady hands reveal her grief without exposition. Their silent recognition at the end (“you found it”) shows a relationship forged in shared reverence, not dialogue. The final choice—to step into visibility—is earned by prior acts of careful offering, with cost felt in the fragility of the tape fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—“my certainty itched where the glove of routine had always fit”—and their transformation from control to stewardship is earned through concrete micro-choices (releasing water channels, letting moss claim posts). Theo functions as a subtle pressure point without overwhelming the single-POV focus. The contradiction between wanting mastery and learning humility plays out in action, not summary.

The father’s legacy functions as both compass and burden, making his final endurance feel earned, not passive. No diagnostic label-speak; even epiphanies arise through concrete action (“knives sharp” reinterpreted as boundary).

    The daughter’s interiority is precise and embodied—her pulse “miscounting,” her chest tightening at her father’s handwriting—and her contradictory impulses (responsibility vs. rebellion, control vs. grief) act simultaneously in scene. Her micro-choices (adopting the lantern, following scrawls, demanding carrots) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she sacrifices academic detachment to hold her father. The father’s presence crystallizes their shared logic of “lucid contradictions,” making their reconciliation earned, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The operator’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—his cultivated estrangement isn’t just stated but enacted through micro-choices (e.g., looping lines while staying at the edge of others’ lives). His renunciation of personal connection after his own ending is earned and costly, shown through tactile habits like polishing the disc in a coat sleeve he no longer wears.

    Mara’s motivation—to cure loneliness through logistics—is embodied in every micro-choice, from trading batteries for truth to writing “friends” in the ledger. Her “desperately jocular” humor isn’t labeled but enacted: the grin “sent ahead to catch a falling person” reveals her emotional strategy under pressure.

Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—dramatizing chores while resisting state-mandated cheer—and his flaw (complicity turned quiet resistance) carries visible cost.

    Lio’s “strangely honest” trait is embodied through her scar, her rope-walking precision, and her refusal to polish ruin—each action revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The narrator’s micro-choices (e.g., asking what consecration means) arise from genuine ignorance, not exposition, and their shared labor crystallizes a moral stance without tidy resolution. Interiority remains concrete (“taste of cedar and iron on our breath”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak. Both characters feel irreducible, shaped by trauma and purpose rather than archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archivist’s interiority is concrete and consistent—“perceptively calm” emerges through embodied choices, not labels. Their micro-decisions (e.g., handing Ole a clothespin) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: devotion’s tremble, lighter map case. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure without crowding the frame; spatial choreography remains lucid. Flaws are implicit in method, not stated, and grief’s handling (“dislikes sudden brightness”) feels earned, not diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reticent scholar’s motivation—to decode silence as living language—is consistent, embodied through micro-choices (borrowing the crystal, humming, arranging echoes), and culminates in a credible renunciation at the Archive Court. His internal conflict between institutional doubt and quiet faith in organic growth never resolves neatly but endures with cost: he risks dismissal yet offers no proof beyond fragile sound-seedlings. Emotion is rendered through tactile detail (“fingertip tracing ivy,” “wobbling ledger”) rather than diagnostic labels. However, his interiority lacks a contradictory impulse that actively opposes his core drive—his restraint feels like temperament, not tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The junkyard prophet’s precognitive forgetfulness manifests in embodied, contradictory behavior—writing instructions he’ll forget, trusting driftwood arrows over memory—making his struggle visceral and specific. His micro-choices (not rewinding the recorder, drawing the circle “Keep”) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on preserving ephemeral truth despite inevitable loss. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, expressing emotion through tactile perception (“tasted salt, maybe from old tears”) and sensory hallucination (“heard his mother turning pages somewhere long before his birth”). The final act of kissing the recorder as “an ear returning from exile” crystallizes his devotion with poignant, earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing, fear vs. trust) act simultaneously in repair choices. Micro-decisions (e.g., looping the leaf recording, seating the governor “with borrowed gravity”) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by Lina’s absence. Emotional progression avoids therapy-speak; longing manifests as luminous ache in ribs, not diagnosis. Final renunciation of control (“holding needs more listening than grip”) is earned through tactile struggle, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ruth and the therapist are rendered with profound specificity—contradictory impulses (Ruth clutching a shard that cut her, Lena’s guilt-laced arrival) drive every micro-choice. The therapist’s “decisively kind” practice manifests not as sentiment but action: dialing twice, using the vinyl as a pick, stepping back to let breaths synchronize. Emotions are embodied (“wind hair and wet cheeks,” “shoulders fold as if relieved”) without diagnostic labels. Their final reconciliation is earned through tactile, constrained gestures—not tidy forgiveness but “bright pieces… enough to mend a useful bowl.”

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s motivation—to witness without theft—drives every micro-choice with quiet integrity, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses extraction and affirms humility. Interiority is embodied (“my hands remember better than my mind”) and avoids diagnostic abstraction. The Archivist functions as a pressure-bearing foil whose presence sharpens the scholar’s stance without overshadowing it. Final endurance (“I do not pull them free”) carries visible cost: relinquishing knowledge for ethical alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interior contradiction—forgiving skepticism—drives every choice with embodied specificity, from doubting the reed decoy to setting the fox’s bone. Mara’s “shrewd innocence” functions as both foil and catalyst, enabling key turns without flattening into archetype. The father’s grief and the narrator’s past misjudgment crystallize a moral cost that feels earned, not ornamental. Final renunciation of rigid doubt (“I have learned to forgive the map and the myth”) emerges directly from tactile, pressured decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—fever-induced sky-loss, tactile sea-glass polishing, and the weight of the pearl all manifest internal conflict without diagnostic abstraction. Motivation (“share light without fire”) directly shapes every action and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses solitude for communal harmony. The final choice—to embed the pearl among sea glass—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: personal isolation traded for collective resonance. Contradictory impulses (earthbound yet star-watching, holding vs. releasing stillness) act simultaneously in scene, not as summary.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“measuring storms by their shadows,” “quietly proactive” as still water until a leaf tilts—and contradictions pulse through every micro-choice (e.g., offering the pendant as both relic and tool). Miri functions not as pressure but as witness, deepening the narrator’s self-reckoning without diluting agency. The amber pendant refracts inherited trauma into active care, and the final renunciation of public speech (“Maybe later…”) carries palpable cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in moss stitches, bee circles, and honeyed hush.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflicted novelist’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile metaphors and micro-choices (e.g., pressing the shell to his ear, placing the star inside it), revealing contradictory impulses—mercy vs. truth, creation vs. erasure—without diagnostic self-awareness. His final act of solemnizing parting is earned by prior encounters with abandoned characters, each interaction deepening his reckoning. The girl’s accusation (“that was erasure”) and the fisherman’s ungranted laughter crystallize his flaw: sparing others from pain by denying their agency. His forgiveness at the end feels costly, not facile, because it emerges from specific renunciations witnessed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lio’s whimsy is embodied through precise micro-choices—cradling the vine like a luthier, speaking in “the tree’s grammar”—that reveal a hierarchy of values centered on attentive reciprocity. His motivation to restore sacred practices is dramatized through tactile ritual, not declared. The child’s role as inheritor adds subtle relational pressure without overextending cast clarity. No internal contradiction weakens his arc, but the absence of genuine struggle or blind spot slightly limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    The alchemist’s motivation—translating heartbeats into maps to find her brother—is rooted in embodied trauma (the scar, the cradlebeat memory) and drives every micro-choice with visceral specificity. Her patience isn’t stated but enacted through kneeling until “knees forgot complaint,” and her flawed faith (“pulse could draw a road if trusted”) is tested by the orchard’s silence. The final direction-gathering against her own wrist pulse shows internal contradiction: hope vs. doubt, urgency vs. stillness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in frost on lashes, charred gloves, and the beeswax seal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The locksmith’s interiority is exquisitely concrete—his peripherally focused perception, tactile engagement with tools, and quiet moral code (“grant entry not to theft but to understanding”) reveal a fully embodied, contradictory psyche. His micro-choices (e.g., using echo-length for seconds, filing gears to count reflections) align with his reflective nature and deepen his commitment under pressure. The final act of sealing “winter-humility” in his rib-cellar crystallizes an earned renunciation with palpable cost: he trades mechanical time for wonder-tuned time, altering his future craft. No diagnostic label-speak; every insight emerges from sensory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Fractal weaver’s interiority is exquisitely embodied: contradictions pulse in micro-choices (e.g., unscrewing the lamp to “coax a steady blue” while fearing drift into irretrievable thought). Motivation—collecting burdens the valley cannot carry—is dramatized through tactile, weighted acts (threading calcified grief onto a cord). The final renunciation (“I accepted the circle”) earns its cost: freedom as boundary-less entrapment. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in whalebone reverie, shingles cool as scallop shells.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The widow’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, memory, and craft intertwine without therapy-speak or abstraction.

The wrist ache and braided mane coil past into present action with emotional specificity. Her contradiction—holding while releasing—is dramatized through tactile work, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret, chronological confusion, and stubborn hope manifest through tactile details (boots tapping, wrench-like regret) rather than diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (fear of restarting the carousel vs. duty to the settlement) collide in real time during negotiation with her ghost. The final choice—to restart but redefine terms—is earned by prior causality: each story fragment she collects reshapes her understanding. The ghost-as-self device avoids sentimentality by grounding emotional cost in concrete stakes: lost rain, eroded ambition, a sacrificed vow.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation—“to puzzle out new equations for hope”—is embodied through tactile, profession-specific choices that reveal interior contradiction: she seeks order yet embraces wonder, repairs machinery yet honors decay. Her micro-choices (using carnival tubing, tuning light with a sextant) align precisely with her stated ethos of “functional creativity,” and the final renunciation isn’t of hope but of isolation—inviting others tomorrow. The boy’s presence crystallizes her shift from solitary calculation to communal stewardship, with visible cost in time, labor, and emotional exposure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in mist on metal, pigeon feet on maps.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The introverted clock scribe’s internal contradiction—yearning for resonance while sworn to silence—is embodied in micro-choices (stroking the bell “nearly hovering,” tuning gears by “twitch of a shadow”) that escalate with excruciating gentleness. His emotional arc avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding longing in tactile specificity: breath on glass, petrichor, silver floors. The final renunciation (“I did not ring the bell; I bore it”) earns closure through consistent interior logic and visible cost—the dream reshaped, not reclaimed. No head-hopping or motivational gaps; every action flows from his quiet, precise worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s motivation—rooted in uncovering systemic deceit—is embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., photographing evidence, staging the scene for the foreman) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction thrums beneath serene resolve: rage versus “colder patience,” instinct versus institutional lies. The retired watchman functions as a crucible, not just a witness, deepening the moral weight of truth-telling. Final renunciation isn’t of action but of illusion—the legend sought is courage, not treasure—earned through consistent, flawed pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)

Flaws like quiet obsession are consistent and consequential, never safety-hedged.

His micro-choices (refusing the Keepers, stealing cloth, tuning pilot lights) carry visible cost and stem from consistent, contradictory impulses: reverence for machinery and longing for organic grace. The final renunciation isn’t rebellion but recalibration, earned by his method of hypothesizing through action. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in piston sighs and lime dust.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “unyielding compassion” and “gracefully alert care” manifest in micro-choices (apologizing to trees, binding grafts with red thread) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation—to prove scars can sing—is rooted in generational trauma and profession, creating credible internal contradiction between legacy and vocation. The boy’s arrival crystallizes her arc without resolving it neatly; her endurance forecloses denial with visible cost (carrying her father’s coin, her own scar). No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    The luminous skeptic’s internal contradiction—testing everything yet carrying a ritual object—is embodied in micro-choices (whispering to fountains, using the brass blade) and culminates in a secret that costs him emotional armor. His flaw (fear of becoming his father) directly enables the climax, and the final renunciation (releasing the memory) feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    The protagonist’s interiority is richly embodied—grief as pollen, light as something to be shared without fire—and their micro-choices (rebuilding the orrery, teaching transit as kindness) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)

The shadow work sequence reveals bruising self-awareness that directly alters tactics, and the final act of carrying the child into the new dimension earns a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: enduring silence, bearing unhealed wounds, and accepting partial healing.

    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “texture of transformation” philosophy manifests in micro-choices like unscrewing bottles or giving away coins. Her destitution and agency coexist without contradiction, and her motivation (“to learn by doing”) feels earned, not declarative. The boy’s minimal but precise presence creates relational pressure that crystallizes her stance. Final renunciation—returning the bugs, vanishing footprints—carries quiet cost consistent with her ethos.

    The lock sentinel’s interiority is vividly embodied—fear “tries to giggle,” metal “stutters”—and his calm inventiveness manifests in tactile, high-stakes choices (e.g., repurposing the quill holder). His contradictions (vigilant yet subversive) drive micro-choices with visible cost: sacrificing his official tool for revolution. The baker and companions are lightly drawn but serve as pressure amplifiers, not distractions. Final renunciation (“I was also a hinge”) feels earned by prior causality and charged with quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    The eel herder’s precognitive curse manifests in embodied contradictions—simultaneous certainty and tremor, agency and entanglement—that drive every micro-choice. Their motivation (to fulfill a promise through sacred math) is consistent, costly, and rooted in specific emotional history (“she whispered... I promised”). The final act of shared bowl-holding crystallizes endurance with visible cost: the relinquishing of solitary control. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains poetic yet concrete (“a thousand versions of my hands shivering around the same cold stone”).

    Ilya’s motivation—to map the “cartography of scars”—is embodied through tactile actions (carrying redacted notebooks, winding the timer) and crystallizes in his climactic recitation. His internal contradiction—between silenced poet and defiant reader—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak. Mara’s arrival sharpens his arc through reciprocal recognition rather than exposition. Their micro-choices (opening the hatch, clicking the timer as lighthouse) reveal a shared hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dueling philosopher’s interiority is richly embodied—mechanical arm servos purring “like attentive cats,” emotions channeled through foil-play and calibration rituals. Contradictory impulses (diplomatic fierceness vs. refusal to humiliate) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in the earned renunciation of victory for trust. The courier’s transformation feels compelled by micro-choices (e.g., glancing at the sundial mid-fight), not convenience. Final cost—offering the card—is legible as both vulnerability and tactical recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vagrant poet’s molting identity is not just stated but enacted—last month a ledger, tonight firelight—and Mara’s unwavering trust in each iteration deepens their bond under pressure. Their micro-choices (twine-measuring, seed-planting) reveal a hierarchy of values: preservation over compliance, beauty over order. Interior contradiction pulses in lines like “my skull molts personalities monthly” without therapy-speak, and the final unsigned poem shows enduring loyalty beneath shifting selves. The relationship functions as crucible: prison-library past directly informs present tactics, and their reunion at the threshold crystallizes a shared renunciation of institutional control.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The pianist’s interiority is vividly embodied—pride as a “locomotive that would not brake,” longing “carved into each diminuendo”—and his micro-choices (winding the broken clock, offering it to Mara) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. His flaw (stubborn pride) directly caused the rupture and now fuels his yearning for an “unplanned encore.” Mara’s return isn’t passive reconciliation; her line “blame was a timetable we no longer had to read” crystallizes their reconfigured dynamic without sentimentality. The final act—winding a broken clock to eke out four beats—perfectly encapsulates earned endurance with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—“luminous doubt,” “balanced between science and song”—and their micro-choices (e.g., staying while others leave, biting the fruit) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, rooted in protecting cultural memory without sentimentality. The character reads as an individual through idiosyncratic perception and voice, not archetype. Final renunciation (lingering after audit completion) is earned by prior causality and carries emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tutor’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his slow speech, bonsai practice, and withheld apology manifest in tactile choices (crushing berries, pruning “nearly nothing”). Contradictory impulses (regret vs. restraint) act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. His final renunciation—choosing tending over cutting—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of permanent absence. Mara’s off-page presence exerts pressure through objects, avoiding headcount issues while deepening his solitude.
